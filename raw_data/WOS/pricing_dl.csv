Pricing European Options with Deep Learning Models,"Applications of artificial neural networks for valuing financial options have a long history in academic research. When appropriately trained, these artificial neural networks have proved to obtain better results than traditional parametric models like Black-Scholes. This short paper intends to review the input variables and specific architecture of a multi-layer perceptron, long-short term memory and a convolutional neural network model for the purpose of pricing options. Additionally, it describes the data gathering process for the dataset that will be used to train these models.",2022
Time-sequencing European options and pricing with deep learning - Analyzing based on interpretable ALE method,"In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of pricing European options with time-sequencing data processing method and deep learning models, based on two European options, the ETF50 options of China and the S&P 500 options of America. Four competing models were built to verify the improvement of the 1D-CNN and LSTM models on the option pricing task. Methods like cross-validations and statistical tests were also used to make our experiments more robust. Besides, in order to increase the stability and the interpretability of our pricing models, we selected the ALE method to interpret and analyze the behavior of the deep learning models. The empirical results indicate that, in both ETF50 option and S&P500 option pricing tasks, the 1D-CNN and LSTM models had significant advantages in forecasting accuracy and robustness under moneyness, trading date or maturity dimension irrespectively. Especially for the LSTM model, which has robust performance using different kinds of cross-validation methods. With the help of ALE method, we proved that the improved performance brought by the 1D-CNN and LSTM models could be attributed to their capability of capturing time-series information and their different emphasis on input features and lags.",2022
Dual-Hybrid Modeling for Option Pricing of CSI 300ETF,"The reasonable pricing of options can effectively help investors avoid risks and obtain benefits, which plays a very important role in the stability of the financial market. The traditional single option pricing model often fails to meet the ideal expectations due to its limited conditions. Combining an economic model with a deep learning model to establish a hybrid model provides a new method to improve the prediction accuracy of the pricing model. This includes the usage of real historical data of about 10,000 sets of CSI 300 ETF options from January to December 2020 for experimental analysis. Aiming at the prediction problem of CSI 300ETF option pricing, based on the importance of random forest features, the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory model (CNN-LSTM) in deep learning is combined with a typical stochastic volatility Heston model and stochastic interests CIR model in parameter models. The dual hybrid pricing model of the call option and the put option of CSI 300ETF is established. The dual-hybrid model and the reference model are integrated with ridge regression to further improve the forecasting effect. The results show that the dual-hybrid pricing model proposed in this paper has high accuracy, and the prediction accuracy is tens to hundreds of times higher than the reference model; moreover, MSE can be as low as 0.0003. The article provides an alternative method for the pricing of financial derivatives.",2022
Option Pricing Using LSTM: A Perspective of Realized Skewness,"Deep learning has drawn great attention in the financial field due to its powerful ability in nonlinear fitting, especially in the studies of asset pricing. In this paper, we proposed a long short-term memory option pricing model with realized skewness by fully considering the asymmetry of asset return in emerging markets. It was applied to price the ETF50 options of China. In order to emphasize the improvement of this model, a comparison with a parametric method, such as Black-Scholes (BS), and machine learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forests and recurrent neural network (RNN), was conducted. Moreover, we also took the characteristic of heavy tail into consideration and studied the effect of realized kurtosis on pricing to prove the robustness of the skewness. The empirical results indicate that realized skewness significantly improves the pricing performance of LSTM among moneyness states except for in-the-money call options. Specifically, the LSTM model with realized skewness outperforms the classical method and other machine learning methods in all metrics.",2023
Deep Learning Based Hybrid Computational Intelligence Models for Options Pricing,"Options are commonly used by traders and investors for hedging their investments. They also allow the traders to execute leveraged trading opportunities. Meanwhile accurately pricing the intended option is crucial to perform such tasks. The most common technique used in options pricing is Black-Scholes (BS) formula. However, there are slight differences between the BS model output and the actual options price due to the ambiguity in defining the volatility. In this study, we developed hybrid deep learning based options pricing models to achieve better pricing compared to BS. The results indicate that the proposed models can generate more accurate prices for all option classes. Compared with BS using annualized 20 intraday returns as volatility, 94.5% improvement is achieved in option pricing in terms of mean squared error.",2022
Bitcoin Options Pricing Using LSTM-based Prediction Model and Blockchain Statistics,"Although Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention, the inaccurate pricing of Bitcoin options has resulted in an inefficient cryptoderivative market. In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",2019
Option pricing with deep learning: a long short-term memory approach,"This paper presents a deep learning approach for option pricing using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network applied to European call options on the S&P 500 index. We utilize a rolling window approach that trains 12 instances of the LSTM model, one for each month of 2021. To gain further insight into the model performance, we use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) through SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). We find that the LSTM model outperforms the Black-Scholes and the Heston models and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network regarding overall pricing accuracy. Most notably, the time-sequencing nature of LSTM enables the proposed model to capture sufficient short-term volatility from recently traded options. This result is still robust when controlling for time-varying volatility dynamics. Thus, the model is less prone to measurement errors in volatility.",2025
Real options pricing based on BP neural networks and-GA,"This paper applies artificial neural networks on real options pricing. We discard redundant nodes and branches of neural networks through choosing variables by using genetic algorithms, so that the optimization on BP neural networks can be realized. In the process of pricing, we consider some factors that have influence on real options pricing and are neglected by existing pricing method, so the precision of evaluation can be improved to a certain extent, which is indicated by simulation results.",2004
A deep learning-based Monte Carlo algorithm with applications in American options pricing,"In this article, we introduce a deep learning-based Monte Carlo method and apply it to pricing high-dimensional American options. This method keeps track of the approximating optimal stopping time and evaluates it by independent samples at each time step. The consistency and convergence rate of the algorithm are derived, which show that this method is able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. The numerical results show that our method is efficient and accurate in pricing high-dimensional American options.",2025
Pricing and Hedging American-Style Options with Deep Learning,"In this paper we introduce a deep learning method for pricing and hedging American-style options. It first computes a candidate optimal stopping policy. From there it derives a lower bound for the price. Then it calculates an upper bound, a point estimate and confidence intervals. Finally, it constructs an approximate dynamic hedging strategy. We test the approach on different specifications of a Bermudan max-call option. In all cases it produces highly accurate prices and dynamic hedging strategies with small replication errors.",2020
Enhancing Option Pricing Accuracy in the Indian Market: A CNN-BiLSTM Approach,"Due to overly optimistic economic and statistical assumptions, the classical option pricing model frequently falls short of ideal predictions. Rapid progress in artificial intelligence, the availability of massive datasets, and the rise in computational power in machines have all created an environment conducive to the development of complex methods for predicting financial derivatives prices. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) based predictive model for accurate and prompt prediction of option prices by fusing a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). A set of 15 predictive factors is carefully built under the umbrella of fundamental market data and technical indicators. Our proposed model is compared with other DL-based models using six evaluation metrics-root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error, mean percentage error, determination coefficient (R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document}), maximum error and median absolute error. Further, statistical analysis of models is also done using one-way ANOVA and posthoc analysis using the Tukey HSD test to demonstrate that the CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms competing models in terms of fit and prediction accuracy.",2024
A deep learning method for pricing high-dimensional American-style options via state-space partition,"This paper proposes a deep learning approach for solving optimal stopping problems and high-dimensional American-style options pricing problems. Through state-space partition, the method does not require recalculation of the structure of networks when the price of the asset changes, which makes tracking valuation more efficient. This paper also offers theoretical proof for the existence of a deep learning network that can determine the optimal stopping time via state-space partition. We present convergence proofs for the estimators and also test the method on Bermuda max-call options as examples.",2024
Evolutionary Hedging Model for Power Trading to Maximize Daily Profits,"Established trading strategies such as fully back-to-back hedging no longer work in a world where customers transfer the cost of hedging completely to traders. Dynamic daily hedging models, in which profits are generated from long and short futures' positions, have been proposed in combination with accurate Phelix futures and spot price forecasting. This study provides a new approach to accurately forecast Phelix monthly futures prices with long short-term memory-recurrent neural network time series. In addition, a newly proposed daily dynamic hedging model capable of processing recurring inputs is optimized with an evolutionary algorithm to maximize daily profits. Calculated optimized daily hedge ratios provided by the algorithm are backtested on real Phelix market data. The results for the different tested periods confirm that a trading company could consistently generate positive returns under the most competitive pricing assumption and outperform established trading strategies in both trending bear and bull markets.",2020
One Parameter Selection Method of the BP Neural Network on Real Options Pricing,"Based on the theory of BP neural network, the evaluation prediction model of real options pricing was established. Some quantized and non-quantized factors were all considered into the model such as evaluation value uncertainty, investment cost, investment opportunity duration, share degree, environment risk and so on. With one given example, the input parameters of the model were optimized by means of genetic algorithm and the detailed input parameters optimization process was also pointed out by dint of one calculation flow chart. The results show that the method not only guarantees the precision of calculation, but also reduces the number of input variables in the prediction model. At the same time, it can avoid that the calculation does not converge because of lots of input parameters to the prediction model. In addition, this can also reduce the subjectivity of the Black-Scholes model and make the evaluation of real options pricing more accurate. As a result, one good prediction effect has been obtained again.",2014
Multi-perspective option price forecasting combining parametric and non-parametric pricing models with a new dynamic ensemble framework,"This article introduces a dynamic ensemble framework that integrates parametric and non-parametric pricing models. Within this framework, we propose a time-varying parametric pricing model optimized using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, we construct a non-parametric pricing model using a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to capture the interactions among options, enhancing the existing nonparametric pricing model. Validation using China's SSE 50 ETF options trading data reveals several key findings: Firstly, the dynamic integration method proposed in this study not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances stability. Secondly, previous parametric pricing models do not effectively utilize their pricing performance, while our proposed time-varying parametric pricing model significantly enhances accuracy. Lastly, the 2D-CNN model, which considers interactions among options trades, proves to be reasonable and effective, outperforming common non-parametric pricing models. The dynamic ensemble framework proposed in this study effectively combines the strengths of both parametric and non-parametric pricing models. This research serves as an important reference for risk managers, institutional investors, and other stakeholders. Furthermore, it provides valuable research ideas for future scholars in the field.",2024
"A Time-Varying, Feature- Rearranged Convolutional Neural Network for Option Pricing","The rigid assumptions underlying conventional parametric option-pricing models prevent them from accurately capturing the underlying nature of the market. Most of these models must be estimated numerically, because they cannot be solved analytically, which inevitably leads to estimation errors. Previous studies of option pricing, which have focused primarily on a single option variable, have not taken into account the effects of other options traded within the same time period. In order to address these issues, the authors use convolutional neural network (CNN) pattern recognition to fit the option panel data and provide a feature-rearrangement mechanism to account for the correlations between non-adjacent options. The suggested feature-rearranged CNN (FR-CNN) model is entirely data-driven without any preliminary assumptions. The authors' experiments with the Chinese SSE 50 ETF option show that the proposed FR-CNN outperformed the jump-diffusion model and CNN by 59.59% and 17.34%, respectively.",2024
Forecasting spot prices of agricultural commodities in India: Application of deep-learning models,"Food price fluctuations can impact both producers and consumers. Forecasting the prices of the agricultural commodities is of prime concern not only to the government but also to farmers and agribusiness firms. In developing countries like India, management of food security needs competent and efficient forecasting of food prices. With the availability of data, recent innovation in deep-learning models provides a feasible solution to accurately forecast the prices. In this study, we examine the superiority of these models using the daily spot prices of five major commodities traded on the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange: cotton seed, castor seed, rape mustard seed, soybean seed, and guar seed. The results were obtained from the application of the traditional univariate autoregressive integrated moving average model and deep-learning techniques like the time-delay neural network (TDNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The empirical results indicate that the LSTM model is indeed suitable for the financial domain and captures the directional movement of the spot price changes with high accuracy compared with the TDNN and other linear models. Accuracy of the performance of these models has been compared using out-of-sample performance measure. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of spot price forecasting for farmers and traders in offering them the best predictions of the price movements. Our results provide a possibility of developing pricing models that can help in fairly regulating agricultural commodity prices.",2021
A CNN based system for predicting the implied volatility and option prices,"The evaluations of option prices and implied volatility are critical for option risk management and trading. Common strategies in existing studies relied on the parametric models. However, these models are based on several idealistic assumptions. In addition, previous research on option pricing mainly depends on the historical transaction records without considering the performance of other concurrent options. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based system for predicting the implied volatility and the option prices. Specifically, the customized non-parametric learning approach is first used to estimate the implied volatility. Second, several traditional parametric models are also implemented to estimate these prices as well. The convolutional neural network is utilized to obtain the predictions based on the estimation of the implied volatility. Our experiments based on Chinese SSE 50 ETF options demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the traditional methods with at least 40.11% performance enhancement in terms of RMSE.",2020
Trend Forecast of Shanghai Crude Oil Futures,"The dominant position in crude oil pricing affects a country's energy and economic security. We construct different time-series forecasting models to analyze the long-term trends of Shanghai crude oil futures and guide current price trading. First, we built a classic ARIMA model as the benchmark. It is a good choice for short-term investors but does not apply to long-term trend prediction. We propose an improved HW-Prophet model that can maximize its advantages in selecting and reconstructing mutation points and reduce the forecast error by approximately 22%. The Prophet model is then introduced into the prediction of futures price series, and the Haar wavelet and KS (HWKS) algorithm and sliding window are used to optimize the change-point selection of the Prophet model. Finally, we created different combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM) and HW-Prophet models based on residual correction and optimal weighting. The results showed that the combined residual correction method was unsuitable for the two single models in this study. Because the residual sequence predicted by the HW-Prophet model is similar to white noise, it is difficult for LSTM to learn the effective dynamic laws from it. By minimizing the error sum of squares to solve the optimal weight coefficients and combining the two models linearly, the prediction advantages of a single model in different intervals can be effectively transmitted, and the prediction accuracy is greatly improved. The HW-Prophet-LSTM combination model constructed in this study based on the optimal weight is currently one of the best models for predicting the long-term trends of Shanghai crude oil futures.",2022
"Do Weather Derivatives Mitigate the Revenue Risk of Farmers?-The Case of Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, China","This research probes the potential of weather derivatives as tools for mitigating the variability of crop yields due to climatic uncertainties in China. Centered on Tongliao City in Inner Mongolia, the study exploits a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to dissect and simulate 32 years of local precipitation data, thereby achieving a simulation of high reliability. Further exploration through a multiple linear regression model confirms a marked positive relationship between rainfall amounts and maize yields. By combining precipitation put options and the total revenue function for farmers, mathematical derivations yield specific expressions for optimal trading quantities and risk hedging efficiency. The research findings show that, using an assumption of a maize price that is 3 CNY/kg, when farmers purchase around 6.22 precipitation put options they can achieve 67.9% risk hedging efficiency. This highlights the significant role of precipitation put options under specific conditions in reducing the risk of decreased maize yields due to reduced precipitation. However, in practical markets, variations in maize prices and the price change unit (lambda) are inevitable. Through further analysis, this study reveals that as these factors change, the optimal trading quantity and hedging efficiency also undergo varying degrees of adjustment. The investigation lays a theoretical groundwork for the practical application and empirical validation of weather derivatives within China's agrarian sector. However, the study underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to market dynamics to refine hedging strategies. Future decision making must integrate market fluctuations, and adopting transparent pricing mechanisms is critical for enhanced risk management and the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices.",2024
SF-Transformer: A Mutual Information-Enhanced Transformer Model with Spot-Forward Parity for Forecasting Long-Term Chinese Stock Index Futures Prices,"The complexity in stock index futures markets, influenced by the intricate interplay of human behavior, is characterized as nonlinearity and dynamism, contributing to significant uncertainty in long-term price forecasting. While machine learning models have demonstrated their efficacy in stock price forecasting, they rely solely on historical price data, which, given the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of financial markets, are insufficient to address the complexity and uncertainty in long-term forecasting due to the limited connection between historical and forecasting prices. This paper introduces a pioneering approach that integrates financial theory with advanced deep learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy and risk management in China's stock index futures market. The SF-Transformer model, combining spot-forward parity and the Transformer model, is proposed to improve forecasting accuracy across short and long-term horizons. Formulated upon the arbitrage-free futures pricing model, the spot-forward parity model offers variables such as stock index price, risk-free rate, and stock index dividend yield for forecasting. Our insight is that the mutual information generated by these variables has the potential to significantly reduce uncertainty in long-term forecasting. A case study on predicting major stock index futures prices in China demonstrates the superiority of the SF-Transformer model over models based on LSTM, MLP, and the stock index futures arbitrage-free pricing model, covering both short and long-term forecasting up to 28 days. Unlike existing machine learning models, the Transformer processes entire time series concurrently, leveraging its attention mechanism to discern intricate dependencies and capture long-range relationships, thereby offering a holistic understanding of time series data. An enhancement of mutual information is observed after introducing spot-forward parity in the forecasting. The variation of mutual information and ablation study results highlights the significant contributions of spot-forward parity, particularly to the long-term forecasting. Overall, these findings highlight the SF-Transformer model's efficacy in leveraging spot-forward parity for reducing uncertainty and advancing robust and comprehensive approaches in long-term stock index futures price forecasting.",2024
Research on Pricing Methods of Convertible Bonds Based on Deep Learning GAN Models,"This paper proposes two data-driven models (including LSTM pricing model, WGAN pricing model) and an improved model of LSM based on GAN to analyze the pricing of convertible bonds. In addition, the LSM model with higher precision in traditional pricing model is selected for comparative study with other pricing models. It is found that the traditional LSM pricing model has a large error in the first-day pricing, and the pricing function needs to be further improved. Among the four pricing models, LSTM pricing model and WGAN pricing model have the best pricing effect. The WGAN pricing model is better than the LSTM pricing model (0.21%), and the LSM improved model (1.17%) is better than the traditional LSM model (2.26%). Applying the generative deep learning model GAN to the pricing of convertible bonds can circumvent the harsh preconditions of assumptions, and significantly improve the pricing effect of the traditional model. The scope of application of each model is different. Therefore, this paper proves the feasibility of the GAN model applied to the pricing of convertible bonds, and enriches the pricing function of derivatives in the financial field.",2023
Merged LSTM-MLP for option valuation,"Traditional option pricing models rely on estimates of expected volatility. The true volatility is not directly observable and must hence be estimated, inevitably with error. Any measurement errors immediately translate into inaccurate pricing, leading to potential losses for economic agents trading options for hedging or speculative purposes. This paper proposes a novel merged LSTM-MLP model for option pricing that circumvents the need for an explicit volatility estimate, leading to more accurate valuations. Through extensive out-of-sample testing on S&P500 call options data from 2015 to 2022 we document the statistical accuracy and economic benefits of the model when compared to relevant benchmarks. The superior performance is enabled by the combined LSTM-MLP architecture, which simultaneously utilizes both time series data and the cross-section of observed option characteristics in a deep learning neural network that accurately captures the complex price dynamics. The results are consistent over time and robust across option moneyness and time-to-expiry.",2025
An Intelligent Learning and Ensembling Framework for Predicting Option Prices,"Estimating option prices and implied volatilities are critical for option risk management and trading. Common strategies in previous studies have relied on parametric models, including the stochastic volatility model (SV), jump-diffusion model (JD), and Black-Scholes model (BS). However, these models are built on several strict and idealistic assumptions, including lognormality and sample-path continuity. In addition, previous studies on option pricing mainly relied on its own market-level indicators without considering the effect of other concurrent options. To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent learning and ensembling framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the customized nonparametric learning approach is first utilized to estimate option prices. Second, several traditional parametric models are also applied to estimate these prices. The estimated prices are combined by a CNN to obtain the final estimations. Our experiments based on Chinese SSE 50 ETF options demonstrate that the proposed intelligent framework outperforms the traditional SV model, JD model, and BS model with at least 41.52% performance enhancement in terms of RMSE.",2021
Deep learning-based least squares forward-backward stochastic differential equation solver for high-dimensional derivative pricing,"We propose a new forward-backward stochastic differential equation solver for high-dimensional derivative pricing problems by combining a deep learning solver with a least squares regression technique widely used in the least squares Monte Carlo method for the valuation of American options. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our least squares backward deep neural network solver and its capability to produce accurate prices for complex early exercisable derivatives, such as callable yield notes. Our method can serve as a generic numerical solver for pricing derivatives across various asset groups, in particular, as an accurate means for pricing high-dimensional derivatives with early exercise features.",2021
Option price forecasting using neural networks,"In this research, forecasting of the option prices of Nikkei 225 index futures is carried out using backpropagation neural networks. Different results in terms of accuracy are achieved by grouping the data differently. The results suggest that for volatile markets a neural network option pricing model outperforms the traditional Black-Scholes model. However, the Black-Scholes model is still good for pricing at-the-money options. In using the neural network model, data partition according to moneyness should be applied. Those who prefer less risk and less returns may use the traditional Black-Scholes model results while those who prefer high risk and high return may choose to use the neural network model results.

"A hybrid approach of wavelet transform, ARIMA and LSTM model for the share price index futures forecasting","In this study, a novel hybrid model for share price index futures forecasting named WT-ARIMALSTM is proposed. In this hybrid model, share price index futures are decomposed to extract data characteristics at different time scales by the wavelet transform and the ARIMA-LSTM model are applied to predict the close price of futures. The findings of the study are as follows. 1) The DWT hybrid model and the MODWT hybrid model have higher forecasting accuracy than some commonly used forecasting models under the three metrics of MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The DWTARIMA-LSTM model has better forecasting performance when the forecasting performance in different markets and the operational efficiency of the method are combined. 2) The DWT method is more applicable than the MODWT method in forecasting models of futures closing price series; the approximate signals obtained from the DWT decomposition have lower volatility and can better characterise the original signals. 3) The LSTM model has better prediction performance for noisy residual series, while the ARIMA model has better prediction performance for less noisy approximate signals. 4) Based on the forecasting results, a timing trading strategy is constructed that can maintain a robust return performance under different market conditions, especially on the risk side with significant advantages. In addition, this work examines the impact of the unexpected event of the COVID-19 epidemic on the forecasting performance of the model, and the results show that the model can adapt to different data structures to achieve more robust forecasting performance. This work provides insights into the integration of deep learning methods with econometric methods in the field of asset pricing.",2024
Energy price prediction based on decomposed price dynamics: A parallel neural network approach,"The growing uncertainties of the world due to geographic tensions, and weather conditions challenge the traditional method to achieve a reliable price prediction of energy future for both asset pricing and risk management. Following the initial success of deep learning models in energy price prediction, we attempt to establish a better architecture of neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy. We propose a novel Parallel Hybrid Neural Network (PHNN) model that utilizes independent sub-networks to effectively capture the distinct features of various sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the PHNN model exhibits a significant performance enhancement of 16.68%, 14.09%, and 2.34% over the EMD-LSTM, the informer model, and the single LSTM model, respectively. In particular, the PHNN outperforms the single LSTM, which is trained on the same inputs, by 2.34% overall while by a remarkable 4.11% during event periods. This suggests that the PHNN derives notable benefits from its distinct architecture, particularly during the initial phase of extreme events characterized by significant price trend changes. Additionally, the study explores the potential benefits of incorporating additional event-tracking indicators for energy futures price forecasting. However, the findings suggest that these indicators may not consistently provide effective complementary information.",2024
Heston-GA Hybrid Option Pricing Model Based on ResNet50,"(1) Background. This study aims to improve the accuracy of the pricing model. (2) Methods. Heston model is combined with ResNet50 convolutional neural network model. Based on the optimization of Heston model parameters by genetic algorithm (GA), ResNet50 model is used to correct the deviation between market option price and Heston price, so a new hybrid option pricing model is established based on the empirical research on the European call options of Huatai-PB CSI 300ETF (code 510300), Harvest CSI 300ETF (code 159919), and SSE 50ETF (code 510050).

(4) Conclusions. It is shown that the combination of Heston model and ResNet50 model with optimized parameters can ensure the interpretability of the model and enhance the nonlinear fitting ability of the model, which confirms the effectiveness of the hybrid model and provides a reference for investors and institutions to make scientific decisions.",2022
A Synergetic Approach to Ethereum Option Valuation Using XGBoost and Soft Reordering 1D Convolutional Neural Networks,"In an ever-evolving realm of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged as a prominent player, captivating both investors and enthusiasts alike. Within the diverse financial landscape of cryptocurrencies, options stand out as a versatile tool, offering flexibility and hedging opportunities. This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to pricing Ethereum options, harnessing the formidable power of XGBoost and the visionary capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This research proposes a novel method that utilizes XGBoost for implied volatility estimation by integrating historical volatility, and generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model-predicted volatility. Subsequently, a soft reordering 1-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) model is employed to enhance the pricing accuracy of Ethereum options. The soft reordering mechanism is used to dynamically rearrange the initial tabular dataset, optimizing it for enhanced learning within the CNN framework. The outcome indicates the ability of the proposed model in estimating implied volatility and pricing options with remarkable accuracy, outperforming traditional option pricing models and data-driven models documented in literature. The proposed model also exhibits the lowest pricing error across all maturities and various moneyness criteria, with the exception of long term put and deep out of the money (DOTM) options.",2025
Numerical solving of the generalized Black-Scholes differential equation using Laguerre neural network,"Reasonable pricing of options in the financial derivatives market is crucial. For American options, or when volatility and interest rate are not constant, it is often difficult to obtain analytical solutions to the Black-Scholes (BS) equation. In this paper, the Laguerre neural network was proposed as a novel numerical algorithm with three layers of neurons for solving BS equations. The validity period and stock price are the input of the network, and the option price is the only output layer. Laguerre functions are used as the activation function of the neuron in the hidden layer. The BS equation and boundary conditions are set as penalty function, the training points are uniformly selected in the domain, and the improved extreme learning machine algorithm is used to optimize the network connection weights. Three experiments calculated the numerical solutions of BS equations for European options and generalized option pricing models. Compared with existing algorithms such as the finite element method and radial basis function neural network, the numerical solutions obtained by Laguerre neural network have higher accuracy and smaller errors, which illustrates the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method for solving BS equations.

On sparse grid interpolation for American option pricing with multiple underlying assets,"In this work, we develop a novel efficient quadrature and sparse grid based polynomial interpolation method to price American options with multiple underlying assets. The approach is based on first formulating the pricing of American options using dynamic programming, and then employing static sparse grids to interpolate the continuation value function at each time step. To achieve high efficiency, we first transform the domain from Rdto (-1, 1)d via a scaled tanh map, and then remove the boundary singularity of the resulting multivariate function over (-1, 1)d by a bubble function and simultaneously, to significantly reduce the number of interpolation points. We rigorously establish that with a proper choice of the bubble function, the resulting function has bounded mixed derivatives up to a certain order, which provides theoretical underpinnings for the use of sparse grids. Numerical experiments for American arithmetic and geometric basket put options with the number of underlying assets up to 16 are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",2025
Deep Learning Based Grapevine Leaf Classification Using Augmented Images and Multi-Classifier Fusion for Improved Accuracy and Precision,"Grapevines mainly produce grapes, which can be enjoyed fresh or processed. Grapevine leaves are also collected annually as a secondary product, with their variety impacting both pricing and flavor. This research utilizes Deep Learning techniques to classify grapevine leaves based on images. Initially, 500 images of vine leaves representing five species are captured using a unique self-illumination system. Data augmentation methods expand the dataset to 2500 images. Classification is conducted using a modern CNN model, specifically fine-tuned MobileNetv2. Data preparation involves training the dataset with three classifiers: basic CNN, VGG19, and MobileNet. Image processing converts the RGBA dataset into RGB format. The dataset is split into three subsets: 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. Model preparation offers three options for selecting the appropriate architecture: Simple CNN, VGG19, and Transfer Learning with MobileNet. Model analysis assesses performance using key metrics and visualizations, achieving an accuracy of 96% with Adam optimizer and 88% with Stochastic Gradient Descent.",2024
Investor sentiment and machine learning: Predicting the price of China's crude oil futures market,"Sentiment analysis technology has made it possible to precisely calculate the daily reactions and opin-ions of investors, which has been found to have a significant influence on financial asset pricing. Thus, in this study, we examine the impacts that predictive power investor sentiment has over the price of China's crude oil. We first constructed investor sentiment indexes of China's crude oil futures based on specific economic variables and comments found on one of the most active online financial forums. Then, five popular machine learning tools were utilized to generate predictions. According to our findings, the long short-term memory model combined with the composite sentiment index performed the best due to a lower rate of prediction errors and greater directional accuracy for time-series forecasting of one-day-ahead prices. In this way, this study could aid researchers to more effectively investigate the en-ergy sector which is rapidly changing and highly speculative in nature (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Option Pricing Based on the Residual Neural Network,"We employ an innovative deep learning method to price options quickly and accurately. Specifically, we construct the Residual Neural Network model (ResNet) by two different basic residual blocks with three one-dimensional convolution layers and a shortcut. This model is a generalized option pricing method, and it can be used to approximate the option pricing formula without any assumptions. Besides, the model also can be easily extended to the deep ResNet model to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Comprehensive numerical experiments show that the deep ResNet model has excellent performance in the pricing of 50ETF options in the Chinese market, and the prediction accuracy of our model is higher than that of commonly used deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN) and fully convolutional networks (FCN).",2024
Solving high-dimensional optimal stopping problems using deep learning,"Nowadays many financial derivatives, such as American or Bermudan options, are of early exercise type. Often the pricing of early exercise options gives rise to high-dimensional optimal stopping problems, since the dimension corresponds to the number of underlying assets. High-dimensional optimal stopping problems are, however, notoriously difficult to solve due to the well-known curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose an algorithm for solving such problems, which is based on deep learning and computes, in the context of early exercise option pricing, both approximations of an optimal exercise strategy and the price of the considered option. The proposed algorithm can also be applied to optimal stopping problems that arise in other areas where the underlying stochastic process can be efficiently simulated. We present numerical results for a large number of example problems, which include the pricing of many high-dimensional American and Bermudan options, such as Bermudan max-call options in up to 5000 dimensions. Most of the obtained results are compared to reference values computed by exploiting the specific problem design or, where available, to reference values from the literature. These numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is highly effective in the case of many underlyings, in terms of both accuracy and speed.",2021
Option pricing mechanisms driven by backward stochastic differential equations,"This study investigates an option pricing method called g-pricing based on backward stochastic differential equations combined with deep learning. We adopted a data-driven approach to find a market-appropriate generator of the backward stochastic differential equation, which is achieved by leveraging the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. Option pricing, which is the solution to the equation, is approximated using a recursive procedure. The empirical results for the S&P 500 index options show that the proposed deep learning g-pricing model has lower absolute errors than the classical Black-Scholes-Merton model for the same forward stochastic differential equations. The g-pricing mechanism has potential applications in option pricing.",2025
Application of deep learning to option hedging strategy,"The emergence of the digital information age has sparked considerable interest in predictive analytics within the realm of finance. Predicting uncertainty lies at the heart of Financial Engineering, where crafting investment or trading strategies using suitable prediction methods can optimize profits. This paper provides a novel work that approves the application of computer deep learning neural network has ability to predict volatility of the BlackScholes model and its derivatives. Employing a data-driven methodology, deep learning neural networks are utilized for volatility prediction, investigating their potential to enhance the accuracy of stock volatility forecasts and options pricing. Subsequently, the forecasted outcomes are leveraged for designing and executing hedging strategies, leading to the creation of three delta hedging approaches based on the anticipated stock volatility. The effectiveness of deep learning neural networks in volatility prediction is demonstrated, showcasing their ability to dynamically capture volatility shifts and outperform traditional models in forecasting accuracy.",2024
An Optimized Hybrid Model for Price Deviation Evaluation based on Neural Network,"As a strong displaying approach, neural networks have been broadly utilized in finance and financial forecasting. Scientific and fair trading-type open-end index fund (ETF) option pricing is favorable to maximizing the risk hedging function of the ETF, but it is also a sophisticated modelling procedure that necessitates a thorough understanding of market laws and economic importance. Based on China SSE 50 ETF, Harvest CSI 300 ETF, and high-frequency option data of 300ETF from Berry, this paper proposes another hybrid modelling method that consolidates the settled long-short-term memory neural network model (NLSTM) with the Heston model to acknowledge dynamic rectification of ETF choice price deviations. The research results show that the volatility characteristics of different types of ETF option prices are significantly different. Whether it is based on the BS pricing model or the Heston pricing model, it is difficult to accurately describe the complex changes in ETF option prices. By combining the NLSTM neural network model with the Heston model, it can effectively capture the dynamic changes of different types of ETF options, thereby improving the accuracy of ETF option pricing.",2023
Deep learning of optimal exercise boundaries for American options,"Efficiently determining a price and optimal exercise boundary for an American option is a critical subject in the financial sector. This study introduces a novel application of long short-term memory neural networks to solve a relevant Volterra equation, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of American option pricing. The proposed approach outperforms traditional numerical techniques, including finite difference methods, binomial trees, and Monte Carlo methods, delivering an impressive speed improvement by a factor of thousands while maintaining industry-accepted accuracy levels. It exhibits computational speeds up to about a hundred times faster than the state-of-the-art method used by Andersen et al. [High-performance American option pricing, J. Comput. Finance 20(1) (2016), pp. 39-87] when evaluating numerous options. The proposed network, trained on a reasonable range of parameters related to the Black-Scholes model, swiftly determines option prices and exercise boundaries, serving as a practical closed-form solution.",2025
Deep Learning in Model Risk Neutral Distribution for Option Pricing,"Option pricing has been studied extensively in recent years. An important issue in option pricing is the estimation of the risk neutral distribution of an underlying asset. Better estimation of this distribution can lead to a more rational investment, enabling one to earn an equal return with lower risk. To price options precisely and correctly, traditional financial engineering methods make some assumptions for the risk neutral distribution. However, some assumptions of traditional methods have proved inappropriate and insufficient in empirical option pricing analysis. To address these problems in option pricing, this study adopts a data-driven approach. Owing to advances in hardware and software, studies have been using deep learning methods to price options; however, these have not adequately considered the risk neutral distribution. This may cause an uncontrollable risk, thereby preventing the real-world application of the model. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a deep learning method with a mixture distribution model. Further, it generates a rational risk neutral distribution with accurate empirical pricing analysis.",2019
Pricing exotic derivatives exploiting structure,"In this paper we introduce a new fast and accurate numerical method for pricing exotic derivatives when discrete monitoring occurs, and the underlying evolves according to a Markov one-dimensional stochastic processes. The approach exploits the structure of the matrix arising from the numerical quadrature of the pricing backward formulas to devise a convenient factorization that helps greatly in the speed-up of the recursion. The algorithm is general and is examined in detail with reference to the CEV (Constant Elasticity of Variance) process for pricing different exotic derivatives, such as Asian, barrier, Bermudan, lookback and step options for which up to date no efficient procedures are available. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results. The MATLAB code used to perform the computation is available online at http://www1.mate.polimi.it/similar to marazzina/BP.htm.

The Study on Option Pricing Based on Wiener-Itô Chaos Expansion and Generative Adversarial Networks,"The stochastic volatility model, for pricing complex financial products, adequately considers the skewness and smile shape of asset volatility. However, it is often challenging to obtain analytical solutions for options on asset prices under such models. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid approach for forecasting the prices of European options based on the Heston model, utilizing the Wiener-It & ocirc; chaos (WIC) expansion and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Firstly, a two-step approach is constructed based on the simulated annealing algorithm and trust region reflective algorithm to globally optimize the Heston model. Secondly, the WIC method is adopted to derive a closed-form approximate pricing formula for European call options under the mixed volatility model, which in turn yields an approximation of option prices under the Heston model. Thirdly, the GANs model, incorporating long short-term memory networks and multi-layer perceptrons, is utilized to train the residual term D, representing the difference between the actual option price and its asymptotic approximation, which substantially improves the forecasting model's accuracy and robustness. Empirical research on SSE 50 ETF options demonstrates that the proposed model achieves better results in terms of accuracy and stability. The empirical results of training the residual term D significantly outperform those of training the actual option price. Additionally, the adversarial game concept of the GANs model leads to significantly better forecast performance compared to other machine learning models.",2024
DeepOption: A novel option pricing framework based on deep learning with fused distilled data from multiple parametric methods,"The remarkable performance of deep learning is based on its ability to learn high-level features by processing large amounts of data. This exceptionally superior performance has attracted the attention of researchers studying option pricing. However, option data are more expensive and less accessible than other types of data and are imbalanced because of the liquidity of options. This motivated us to propose a new option pricing and delta-hedging framework called DeepOption. This framework, which is based on deep learning, can improve the performance even when applying imbalanced real option data. In particular, the framework fuses simulated big data, known as distilled data, obtained using various traditional parametric methods. The proposed model employs the following three-stage training approach: Our model is pre-trained using big distilled data after it is finetuned using real option data through transfer learning. Finally, a delta branch is added to the model and trained. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method using three sets of real option data, namely S&P 500 European call options, EuroStoxx50 call options, and Hang Seng Index put options. Our experimental results on option pricing demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms parametric methods and other machine learning methods. Specifically, our model, which uses pre-training with distilled data, reduces the overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by more than 50%, compared with that of a deep learning model using only real option data without pre-training.",2021
Pricing options with a new hybrid neural network model,"A novel hybrid option pricing model using a deep learning neural network has been developed. The hybrid model keeps the traditional option pricing model with the same input parameters while simultaneously adjusting the model with neural network methods to improve accuracy when applied to real market data, especially in OTM options. The new hybrid model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to both traditional parametric and non-parametric option pricing models for both Call and Put options across all moneyness levels. The empirical results of the hybrid model provide an explanation for the deviation from the Put-Call parity observed in real market data.",2024
A novel recurrent neural network based prediction system for trading,"To reduce their exposure to price fluctuations in the markets, traders are increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities. There is thus a need to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions to capture the complex dynamics of price processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using a recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of commodities such as gold and currencies. The price predictions, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments show that the trading system can, when using the proposed network and strategy, form portfolios yielding a return on investment of nearly 5%.",2006
Deep Curve-Dependent PDEs for Affine Rough Volatility,"We introduce a new deep learning--based algorithm to evaluate options in affine rough stochastic volatility models. Viewing the pricing function as the solution to a curve-dependent PDE, depending on forward curves rather than the whole path of the process, we develop a numerical scheme based on deep learning techniques. Numerical simulations suggest that the latter is a promising alternative to classical Monte Carlo simulations.",2023
Empirical of the Taiwan stock index option price forecasting model - applied artificial neural network,"This work presents a novel neural network model for forecasting option prices using past volatilities and other options market factors.

The ability to develop accurate forecasts of grey prediction volatility enables practitioners to establish an appropriate hedging strategy at in-the-money option.",2009
Meshless methods for American option pricing through Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"Nowadays, Deep Learning is drastically revolutionizing financial research as well as industry. Many methods have been discussed in the last few years, mainly related to option pricing. In fact, traditional approaches such as Monte Carlo simulation or finite difference methods are seriously harmed by multi-dimensional underlying and path dependency. Thus, dealing with particular contracts such as American multi-asset options is still rough. This paper addresses such a problem by pricing said put options with a novel meshless methodology, named Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), based on Artificial Intelligence. PINN paradigm has been recently introduced in Deep Learning literature. It exploits the theoretical background of the universal approximation theorem for neural networks to solve Partial Differential Equations numerically. This Deep Learning meshless method incorporates the equation and its initial and boundary conditions thanks to a specially designed loss function. We develop a suitable PINN for the proposed problem by introducing an algorithmic trick for improving the convergence of the free boundary problem. Furthermore, the worthiness of the proposal is assessed by several experiments concerned with single and multi-asset options. Finally, a parametric model is built to benefit further studies of option value behaviour related to particular market conditions.",2023
Pricing high-dimensional Bermudan optionsusing deep learning and higher-order weakapproximation,"This paper proposes a new deep-learning-based algorithm for high-dimensionalBermudan option pricing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study ofthe arbitrary-order discretization scheme in Bermudan option pricing or dynamicprogramming problems. By discretizing the interval between early-exercise datesusing a higher-order weak approximation of stochastic differential equations, it ispossible to accurately approximate the price of Bermudan options. In particular,we provide the theoretical rate of convergence for the discretization of a Bermudanoption price by utilizing the error analysis of the weak approximation of stochas-tic differential equations for the case of irregular payoff functions. This high-performance deep-learning method permits the conditional expectations appearingin Bermudan option pricing to be estimated quickly even if the dimension is high The new approximation scheme is an alternative to the least squares regressionmethod. Numerical examples for Bermudan option pricing in high-dimensional set-tings (including a 100-dimensional stochastic alpha-beta-rho model) demonstratethe validity of the proposed scheme",2024
Deep Learning and American Options via Free Boundary Framework,"We propose a deep learning method for solving the American options model with a free boundary feature. To extract the free boundary known as the early exercise boundary from our proposed method, we introduce the Landau transformation. For efficient implementation of our proposed method, we further construct an implicit dual solution framework consisting of a novel auxiliary function and free boundary equations. The auxiliary function is formulated to include the feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) output and further mimic the far boundary behaviour, smooth pasting condition, and remaining boundary conditions due to the second-order space derivative and first-order time derivative. Because the early exercise boundary and its derivative are not a priori known, the boundary values mimicked by the auxiliary function are in approximate form. Concurrently, we then establish equations that approximate the early exercise boundary and its derivative directly from the DNN output based on some linear relationships at the left boundary. Furthermore, the option Greeks are obtained from the derivatives of this auxiliary function. We test our implementation with several examples and compare them with the existing numerical methods. All indicators show that our proposed deep learning method presents an efficient and alternative way of pricing options with early exercise features.",2024
Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network for Pricing Multi-Asset European Options,"This paper studies a p-layers deep learning artificial neural network (DLANN) for European multi-asset options. Firstly, a p-layers DLANN is constructed with undetermined weights and bias. Secondly, according to the terminal values of the partial differential equation (PDE) and the points that satisfy the PDE of multi-asset options, some discrete data are fed into the p-layers DLANN. Thirdly, using the least square error as the objective function, the weights and bias of the DLANN are trained well. In order to optimize the objective function, the partial derivatives for the weights and bias of DLANN are carefully derived. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, a time-segment DLANN is proposed. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed p-layers DLANN. Computational examples show that the DLANN's relative error is less than 0.5% for different numbers of assets d=1,2,3,4. In the future, the p-layers DLANN can be extended into American options, Asian options, Lookback options, and so on.",2025
A novel recurrent neural network-based prediction system for option trading and hedging,"In order to reduce their exposure to the erratic fluctuations of the financial markets, traders are nowadays increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities instead of directly trading in the underlying assets. This paradigm shift has attracted the attention of many researchers, and there has been a tremendous increase in the awareness and activities of derivative securities. In particular there is a need to devise new techniques to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions and approximations to capture the complex dynamics of pricing processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using an ad-hoc recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of war commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as currencies, which are increasingly gaining importance in the financial markets. The price predictions from the network, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments with actual gold and currency trading data show that our system using the proposed network and strategy can construct portfolios yielding a return on investment of about 4.76%.",2008
Deep joint learning valuation of Bermudan swaptions,"This paper addresses the problem of pricing involved financial derivatives by means of advanced deep learning techniques. More precisely, we methodically integrate several sophisticated neural network-based concepts like differential machine learning, Monte Carlo simulation-like training samples and joint learning to come up with an efficient numerical solution. The application of the latter development represents a novelty in the context of computational finance. We also propose a novel design of interdependent neural networks to price early-exercise products, in this case, Bermudan swaptions. The improvements in efficiency and accuracy provided by the approach proposed here are widely illustrated throughout a range of numerical experiments. Moreover, this novel methodology can be extended to the pricing of other financial derivatives.",2025
A Novel Bitcoin and Gold Prices Prediction Method Using an LSTM-P Neural Network Model,"As a result of the fast growth of financial technology and artificial intelligence around the world, quantitative algorithms are now being employed in many classic futures and stock trading, as well as hot digital currency trades, among other applications today. Using the historical price series of Bitcoin and gold from 9/11/2016 to 9/10/2021, we investigate an LSTM-P neural network model for predicting the values of Bitcoin and gold in this research. We first employ a noise reduction approach based on the wavelet transform to smooth the fluctuations of the price data, which has been shown to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, we apply a wavelet transform to diminish the influence of high-frequency noise components on prices. Third, in the price prediction model, we develop an optimized LSTM prediction model (LSPM-P) and train it using historical price data for gold and Bitcoin to make accurate predictions. As a consequence of our model, we have a high degree of accuracy when projecting future pricing. In addition, our LSTM-P model outperforms both the conventional LSTM models and other time series forecasting models in terms of accuracy and precision.",2022
Option Pricing Based on GA-BP neural network,"Machine Learning has received widespread attention in the financial field, especially in the issue of option pricing. Compared with the original BSM (Black-Scholes-Merton) option pricing method, this paper introduces the genetic algorithm into the option pricing process based on the characteristics of financial data, and constructs a GA-BP neural network (Neural Networks) option pricing Model and empirical analysis of European call options based on the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index. The research results show that the option price calculation result of the GA-BP neural network algorithm has better accuracy than the BP neural network model or the classic BSM method, while taking into account efficiency, which is helpful to predicting option prices in financial practice to a certain extent.

Numerical solving of generalized Black-Scholes differential equation using deep learning based on blocked residual connection,"Option pricing in the financial derivatives market is worth studying. When the volatility and the rate of return are not fixed in Blacks-Scholes (BS) equation, the analytical form of the solution is difficult to be obtained. In this paper, we propose deep learning based on blocked residual connection method (DLBR) for the numerical solving of BS equations. The validity period and inventory price are the inputs of the network, while the option price is the solution. Neurons on the multiple hidden layers are processed in blocks and each block is connected to the residuals. The boundary conditions are constructed as a part of the numerical solution and the loss function is minimized to obtain the optimal network parameters. The DLBR method has strong applicability and overcomes the shortcomings of extreme learning machines. Three experiment calculated the numerical solution of the BS equation about European options and promoted the option pricing model. Compared with the existing algorithms such as finite element method and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) method, the obtained numerical solution has higher precision and smaller error, which shows the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.

On pricing of discrete Asian and Lookback options under the Heston model,"We propose a new, data-driven approach for efficient pricing of - fixed- and floating-strike - discrete arithmetic Asian and Lookback options when the underlying process is driven by the Heston model dynamics. The method proposed in this article constitutes an extension of Perotti and Grzelak [Fast sampling from time-integrated bridges using deep learning, J. Comput. Math. Data Sci. 5 (2022)], where the problem of sampling from time-integrated stochastic bridges was addressed. The model relies on the Seven-League scheme [S. Liu et al. The seven-league scheme: Deep learning for large time step Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic differential equations, Risks 10 (2022), p. 47], where artificial neural networks are employed to 'learn' the distribution of the random variable of interest utilizing stochastic collocation points [L.A. Grzelak et al. The stochastic collocation Monte Carlo sampler: Highly efficient sampling from expensive distributions, Quant. Finance 19 (2019), pp. 339-356]. The method results in a robust procedure for Monte Carlo pricing. Furthermore, semi-analytic formulae for option pricing are provided in a simplified, yet general, framework. The model guarantees high accuracy and a reduction of the computational time up to thousands of times compared to classical Monte Carlo pricing schemes.",2024
Instantaneous and Averaged Volatility in Two-Side Filtration Model of Financial Asset Pricing,"A two-factor approach to asset pricing based on averaged historical and instantaneous volatility defined by a marginal investor's beliefs and herding behaviour is proposed. For the two-side filtration, backward SDE-defined stochastic dynamics under the risk-neutral probability measure are determined by a target price distribution at given horizon with parameters averaged over a subset of active market agents. For the current price at market equilibrium and instantaneous volatility, the distribution of acceptable price of risk is obtained. The found implied volatility dependencies on strike and maturity are corresponding to the historical data for options by Carr and Wu (2016). The liquidity discount for bonds and options is derived. A generalized solution for the FBSDE and a partial solution for the stochastic terminal conditions are found. The developed two-factor approach is well-suited to deep learning pricing algorithms.",2023
Improving neural network based option price forecasting,"As is widely known, the popular Black & Scholes model for option pricing suffers from systematic biases, as it relies on several highly questionable assumptions. In this paper we study the ability of neural networks (MLPs) in pricing call options on the S&P 500 index; in particular we investigate the effect of the hidden neurons in the in- and out-of-sample pricing. We modify the Black & Scholes model given the price of an option based on the no-arbitrage value of a forward contract, written on the same underlying asset, and we derive a modified formula that can be used for our purpose. Instead of using the standard backpropagation training algorithm we replace it with the Levenberg-Marquardt approach. By modifying the objective function of the neural network, we focus the learning process on more interesting areas of the implied volatility surface. The results from this transformation are encouraging.",2006
Improved BP Neural Network and Its Application in Real Option Pricing,"In recent years, many overseas and domestic experts had paid attention to research on options pricing. But these methods could not get rid of the subjectivity and fuzzy qualities existing in pricing process, and the accuracy of assessed results had not quite improved.

The paper researches on an improved BP artificial neural network model and its appliance in the investment decision-making.",2008
Artificial Neural Networks Performance in WIG20 Index Options Pricing,"In this paper, the performance of artificial neural networks in option pricing was analyzed and compared with the results obtained from the Black-Scholes-Merton model, based on the historical volatility. The results were compared based on various error metrics calculated separately between three moneyness ratios. The market data-driven approach was taken to train and test the neural network on the real-world options data from 2009 to 2019, quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The artificial neural network did not provide more accurate option prices, even though its hyperparameters were properly tuned. The Black-Scholes-Merton model turned out to be more precise and robust to various market conditions. In addition, the bias of the forecasts obtained from the neural network differed significantly between moneyness states. This study provides an initial insight into the application of deep learning methods to pricing options in emerging markets with low liquidity and high volatility.",2022
A new deep neural network algorithm for multiple stopping with applications in options pricing,"In this paper, we propose a deep learning method to solve high-dimensional optimal multiple stopping problems. We represent the policies of multiple stopping problems by the composition of functions. Using the new representation, we approximate the optimal stopping policy recursively with simulation samples. We also derive lower and upper bounds and confidence intervals for the values. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the pricing of swing options, and it produces accurate results in high-dimensional problems.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2023
Artificial neural network for option pricing with and without asymptotic correction,"This paper proposes a mixed approach of asymptotic expansion (AE) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods for option pricing in order to improve computational speed, stability, and approximation accuracy. In practice, there is wide use of complex stochastic volatility models (SVMs) which can allow for skew and smile shapes. However, under these models, it is usually hard to obtain analytical solutions for options written on the asset price. AE can compute option prices and their sensitivities effectively, but it can usually only compute a finite sum of terms of the complete solution because, as the expansion order increases, both analytical and numerical calculations become tedious and messy and the computational cost grows exponentially. On the other hand, using ANN one can separate the pricing procedure into two steps: (1) approximating ANN that can be trained offline and (2) using the ANN predicted option price obtained online. The offline procedure has an extremely high-computational cost because it requires tens to hundreds of thousands of Monte Carlo (MC) or PDE numerical simulations in order to train several hidden layers and several dozens of nodes. Moreover, deep learning (DL) for option pricing shows unstable behaviour and poor quality because the sensitivity of the derivatives price with respect to the input often takes a bell-shape, which induces rapid changes in value. By combining the strong points and making up for the weak points of the two methods, our new approach offers the following improvements: (1) much less training data, layers, and nodes are required: (2) the offline training becomes more robust and the online predictions produce more stable and accurate results: and (3) it significantly speeds up the offline calculations.",2021
Study of Pricing of High-Dimensional Financial Derivatives Based on Deep Learning,"Many problems in the fields of finance and actuarial science can be transformed into the problem of solving backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) and partial differential equations (PDEs) with jumps, which are often difficult to solve in high-dimensional cases. To solve this problem, this paper applies the deep learning algorithm to solve a class of high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations with jump terms and their corresponding backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jump terms. Using the nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula, the problem of solving this kind of PDE is transformed into the problem of solving the corresponding backward stochastic differential equations with jump terms, and the numerical solution problem is turned into a stochastic control problem. At the same time, the gradient and jump process of the unknown solution are separately regarded as the strategy function, and they are approximated, respectively, by using two multilayer neural networks as function approximators. Thus, the deep learning-based method is used to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by high-dimensional PDE with jump, and the numerical solution is obtained. In addition, this paper proposes a new optimization algorithm based on the existing neural network random optimization algorithm, and compares the results with the traditional optimization algorithm, and achieves good results. Finally, the proposed method is applied to three practical high-dimensional problems: Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, bond pricing under the jump Vasicek model and option pricing under the jump diffusion model. The proposed numerical method has obtained satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. The method has important application value and practical significance in investment decision-making, option pricing, insurance and other fields.",2023
Deep weighted Monte Carlo: a hybrid option pricing framework using neural networks,"Recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to compress high-dimensional implied volatility surfaces into a low dimensional representation. Although this method can be effectively used for pricing vanilla options, it does not provide any explicit information about the dynamics of the underlying asset. In our work we present an effective way to overcome this problem. We use a Weighted Monte Carlo approach to first generate paths from a simple a priori Brownian dynamics, and then calculate path weights to price options correctly. We develop and successfully train a neural network that is able to assign these weights directly from the latent space. Combining the encoder network of the VAE and this new weight assigner module, we are able to build a dynamic pricing framework which cleanses the volatility surface from irrelevant noise fluctuations, and then can price not just vanillas, but also exotic options on this idealized vol surface. This pricing method can provide relative value signals for option traders.Key findings of the paper: We confirmed the success of Variational Autoencoders in compressing volatility surfaces into low dimensional latent spaces in the swaption market.We successfully extracted the physically meaningful information from the latent representation of the market by translating the latent coordinates into weights of Monte Carlo paths.We developed a hybrid approach by combining Deep Learning and Weighted Monte Carlo that can price any type of option consistently with the latent model represented by the fully trained VAE.",2023
Deep Local Volatility,"Deep learning for option pricing has emerged as a novel methodology for fast computations with applications in calibration and computation of Greeks. However, many of these approaches do not enforce any no-arbitrage conditions, and the subsequent local volatility surface is never considered. In this article, we develop a deep learning approach for interpolation of European vanilla option prices which jointly yields the full surface of local volatilities. We demonstrate the modification of the loss function or the feed forward network architecture to enforce (hard constraints approach) or favor (soft constraints approach) the no-arbitrage conditions and we specify the experimental design parameters that are needed for adequate performance. A novel component is the use of the Dupire formula to enforce bounds on the local volatility associated with option prices, during the network fitting. Our methodology is benchmarked numerically on real datasets of DAX vanilla options.",2020
Stock Volatility Forecast Base on Comparative Learning and Autoencoder Framework,"Volatility is an important indicator of derivatives pricing, financial risk measurement, and market panic sentiment measurement. A reasonable prediction of volatility is of great significance to market participants and regulators. This article proposes a new volatility forecast model. We use comparative learning and autoencoders to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. Reduce the instability of financial data due to noise.

Learning the random variables in Monte Carlo simulations with stochastic gradient descent: Machine learning for parametric PDEs and financial derivative pricing,"In financial engineering, prices of financial products are computed approximately many times each trading day with (slightly) different parameters in each calculation. In many financial models such prices can be approximated by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To obtain a good approximation the MC sample size usually needs to be considerably large resulting in a long computing time to obtain a single approximation. A natural deep learning approach to reduce the computation time when new prices need to be calculated as quickly as possible would be to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the function which maps parameters of the model and of the financial product to the price of the financial product. However, empirically it turns out that this approach leads to approximations with unacceptably high errors, in particular when the error is measured in the L infinity-norm, and it seems that ANNs are not capable to closely approximate prices of financial products in dependence on the model and product parameters in real life applications. This is not entirely surprising given the high-dimensional nature of the problem and the fact that it has recently been proved for a large class of algorithms, including the deep learning approach outlined above, that such methods are in general not capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality for such approximation problems in the L infinity-norm. In this article we introduce a new numerical approximation strategy for parametric approximation problems including the parametric financial pricing problems described above and we illustrate by means of several numerical experiments that the introduced approximation strategy achieves a very high accuracy for a variety of high-dimensional parametric approximation problems, even in the L infinity-norm. A central aspect of the approximation strategy proposed in this article is to combine MC algorithms with machine learning techniques to, roughly speaking, learn the random variables (LRV) in MC simulations. In other words, we employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods not to train parameters of standard ANNs but instead to learn random variables appearing in MC approximations. In that sense, the proposed LRV strategy has strong links to Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods as well as to the field of algorithm learning. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that the LRV strategy might indeed be capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the L infinity-norm in several cases where the standard deep learning approach has been proven not to be able to do so. This is not a contradiction to the established lower bounds mentioned above because this new LRV strategy is outside of the class of algorithms for which lower bounds have been established in the scientific literature. The proposed LRV strategy is of general nature and not only restricted to the parametric financial pricing problems described above, but applicable to a large class of approximation problems. In this article we numerically test the LRV strategy in the case of the pricing of European call options in the Black-Scholes model with one underlying asset, in the case of the pricing of European worst-of basket put options in the Black-Scholes model with three underlying assets, in the case of the pricing of European average put options in the Black-Scholes model with three underlying assets and knock-in barriers, as well as in the case of stochastic Lorentz equations. For these examples the LRV strategy produces highly convincing numerical results when compared with standard MC simulations, QMC simulations using Sobol sequences, SGD-trained shallow ANNs, and SGD-trained deep ANNs.",2024
Forecasting and trading currency volatility: An application of recurrent neural regression and model combination,"In this paper, we examine the use of non-parametric Neural Network Regression (NNR) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) regression models for forecasting and trading currency volatility, with an application to the GBP/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. Both the results of the NNR and RNN models are benchmarked against the simpler GARCH alternative and implied volatility. Two simple model combinations are also analysed. The intuitively appealing idea of developing a nonlinear nonparametric approach to forecast FX volatility, identify mispriced options and subsequently develop a trading strategy based upon this process is implemented for the first time on a comprehensive basis. Using daily data from December 1993 through April 1999, we develop alternative FX volatility forecasting models. These models are then tested out-of-sample over the period April 1999-May 2000, not only in terms of forecasting accuracy, but also in terms of trading efficiency: in order to do so, we apply a realistic volatility trading strategy using FX option straddles once mispriced options have been identified. Allowing for transaction costs, most trading strategies retained produce positive returns. RNN models appear as the best single modelling approach yet, somewhat surprisingly, model combination which has the best overall performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, fails to improve the RNN-based volatility trading results. Another conclusion from our results is that, for the period and currencies considered, the currency option market was inefficient and/or the pricing formulae applied by market participants were inadequate.

Some Computational Methods in Finance,"Partial Differential Equations (PDE) and Partial Integro-Differential Equations (PIDE) play a major role in financial mathematics and provide a powerful and consistent framework for pricing complex financial derivatives. However, since closedform solutions are not available in general, numerical methods are often used. The article considers financial models based on exponential Levy processes, the PIDE derived from the models and different computational methods for solving these PIDE. A proposal for using Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) for solving PIDE is presented.",2021
How Can We Train Deep Learning Models Across Clouds and Continents? An Experimental Study,"This paper aims to answer the question: Can deep learning models be cost-efficiently trained on a global market of spot VMs spanning different data centers and cloud providers? To provide guidance, we extensively evaluate the cost and throughput implications of training in different zones, continents, and clouds for representative CV, NLP and ASR models. To expand the current training options further, we compare the scalability potential for hybrid-cloud scenarios by adding cloud resources to on-premise hardware to improve training throughput. Finally, we show how leveraging spot instance pricing enables a newcost-efficient way to train models with multiple cheap VMs, trumping both more centralized and powerful hardware and even on-demand cloud offerings at competitive prices.",2024
Deep Learning Approach for Prognoses of Long-Term Options Behavior,"Since the inception of asset pricing models, starting as far back as beginning of XX century, and moreover after the fundamental work of Black and Scholes (1973), there has been considerable interest in analytical research of stock exchange equities behavior. Still up to nowadays it remains a critical task for participants engaged in the field of financial mathematics. The reason of such an undying interest is that to adequately assess investments risks the stock exchange actors (brokers, investors, traders, et. al) need still more and more accurate prediction results obtained as fast as possible. It is a matter of fact proven by numerous researchers that assets derivatives behave differently being observed in small, medium, and long-term frames. Algorithms for predicting the dynamics of stock options and other assets derivatives for both small times (where one plays on market fluctuations), and medium ones (where trade is stressed at the beginning and closing moments) are well developed, and trading robots are actively used for these purposes. Analysis of the dynamics of assets for very long time-frames (of order of several months and years) is still beyond the scope of analysts as it is expensively prohibited, although this issue is extremely important for hedging the investments portfolios. The present paper focuses on construction of an effective and resourceintensive model for predicting the behavior of financial instruments, trends and price movements based upon the principles of deep learning. The forecasts obtained by the model showed an almost acceptable compliance with the true prices of the S&P500.",2019
Deep learning for derivatives pricing: a comparative study of asymptotic and quasi-process corrections,"In this study, we compare two methods for using neural networks to efficiently learn the price of derivatives. The first method, proposed by Funahashi (Quant Financ 21(4):575-592, 2021a), involves training the neural networks to learn the difference between the derivative price and its asymptotic expansion, rather than learning the derivative price directly. The target derivative price is then obtained by adding the approximate solution with the predicted value of neural networks. This method reduces the required amount of learning data, often by a factor of one hundred to one thousand, compared to the case where the derivative price is directly learned through neural networks. In the second method, established in this paper, the neural networks learn the difference between the derivative price written on the underlying asset price that follows the target complex stochastic process and the derivative price written on the underlying asset price that has a relatively simple stochastic process that has a closed-form solution for the target derivative prices. This method provides an alternative valuation method when no efficient approximate solution for the derivative value is observed and if one can arbitrarily determine the model parameters of the quasi-process that approximates the original process. We also propose a unified method to determine the model parameters of quasi-processes from underlying asset processes. These methods prove valuable in cases where general analytic solutions are absent, as seen in widely used financial models such as the stochastic volatility models. These cases involve time-consuming numerical calculations to generate learning data, highlighting the value of the two methods, which significantly compress calculation times.",2024
Milk marketing policy options for the dairy industry in New England,"New England dairy farmers are under intense price pressure resulting from important growth in milk production from lower cost of production Southwest states as well as by retailers' market power. Agricultural officials and legislative bodies in New England and in other Northeast US states are aware of these pressures and have been reacting with emergency dairy farm aid, following a very low 2006 milk price, and with state legislations in an attempt to address perceived excess retailing margins for fluid milk. In this paper, we suggest that a sigmoid demand relationship exists for fluid milk. This demand relationship would explain fluid milk asymmetric price transmission, high-low pricing, and the creation of a large retailing margin (chain surplus) often observed for fluid milk. It is also argued that a sigmoid demand relationship offers an opportunity for state legislators to help Northeast dairy farmers capturing a larger share of the dollar of the consumers through various policy options. Therefore, 5 milk market channel regulatory mechanisms (status quo, price gouging, supply control, fair share policy, and chain surplus return) are discussed and compared. The supply control mechanism was found the most effective at redistributing the chain surplus, associated with the sigmoid demand relationship for fluid milk, to dairy farmers. However, this option is unlikely to be politically acceptable in the United States. Second-best options for increasing dairy farmers' share of the consumers' dollar are the fair price policy and the chain surplus return. The former mechanism would distribute the chain surplus between retailers, processors, and farmers, whereas the latter would distribute it between consumers, retailers, and farmers. Remaining mechanisms would either transfer the chain surplus to retailers (status quo) or to consumers (price gouging).",2008
Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach,"We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly scalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional approaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or assumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from the need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from market data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the models leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels of transaction costs.",2024
Stable Multilevel Deep Neural Networks for Option Pricing and xVAs Using Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations,"Deep learning techniques have significantly impacted fields such as image processing, computer vision, and natural language processing. However, their influence on quantitative finance, particularly in option pricing, hedging, and portfolio management, has been limited. Traditional financial applications rely on rigorous mathematical models and established numerical methods like Monte Carlo and finite difference methods. However, these methods struggle with high-dimensional problems. Recent works propose using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to solve high-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in finance, potentially overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques. Despite the recent progress, DNN methods face high computational costs, stability issues, and generally fail to meet the high accuracy requirements of the financial industry. This paper addresses these challenges. To address the high computational cost of training deep neural networks for financial applications, we propose a multilevel architecture inspired by multilevel Monte Carlo methods. To enhance stability, we adopt a dynamical systems perspective and utilize the NAIS-Net architecture, which ensures global asymptotic stability. For improving accuracy, we leverage the forward and backward systems of stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) for option pricing problems. We also provide a theoretical argument that suggests that the proposed approach is superior to Physics Informed Neural Networks. Finally, the proposed methodology is implemented on several option pricing and xVA problems and is shown to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy, notably improving the pricing of options and xVAs by an order of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods.",2024
Tensor Processing Units for Financial Monte Carlo,"Monte Carlo methods are critical to many routines in quantitative finance such as derivatives pricing, hedging and risk metrics. Unfortunately, Monte Carlo methods are very computationally expensive when it comes to running simulations in high-dimensional state spaces where they are still a method of choice in the financial industry. Recently, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have provided considerable speedups and decreased the cost of running Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in Deep Learning. After highlighting computational similarities between training neural networks with SGD and simulating stochastic processes, we ask in the present paper whether TPUs are accurate, fast and simple enough to use for financial Monte Carlo. Through a theoretical reminder of the key properties of such methods and thorough empirical experiments we examine the fitness of TPUs for option pricing, hedging and risk metrics computation. In particular we demonstrate that, in spite of the use of mixed precision, TPUs still provide accurate estimators which are fast to compute when compared to GPUs. We also show that the Tensorflow programming model for TPUs is elegant, expressive and simplifies automated differentiation.",2020
CBI-time-changed Levy processes for multi-currency modeling,"We develop a stochastic volatility framework for modeling multiple currencies based on CBI-time-changed Levy processes. The proposed framework captures the typical risk characteristics of FX markets and is coherent with the symmetries of FX rates. Moreover, due to the self-exciting behavior of CBI processes, the volatilities of FX rates exhibit self-exciting dynamics. By relying on the theory of affine processes, we show that our approach is analytically tractable and that the model structure is invariant under a suitable class of risk-neutral measures. A semi-closed pricing formula for currency options is obtained by Fourier methods. We propose two calibration methods, also by relying on deep-learning techniques, and show that a simple specification of the model can achieve a good fit to market data on a currency triangle.",2024
Detecting asset price bubbles using deep learning,"In this paper, we employ deep learning techniques to detect financial asset bubbles by using observed call option prices. The proposed algorithm is widely applicable and model-independent. We test the accuracy of our methodology in numerical experiments within a wide range of models and apply it to market data of tech stocks in order to assess if asset price bubbles are present. Under a given condition on the pricing of call options under asset price bubbles, we are able to provide a theoretical foundation of our approach for positive and continuous stochastic asset price processes. When such a condition is not satisfied, we focus on local volatility models. To this purpose, we give a new necessary and sufficient condition for a process with time-dependent local volatility function to be a strict local martingale.",2025
Hodrick-Prescott filter-based hybrid ARIMA-SLFNs model with residual decomposition scheme for carbon price forecasting,"Accurate carbon pricing guidance is of great importance for the inhibition of excessive carbon dioxide emissions. Aiming at improving forecast performance, a number of carbon price forecasting models have been proposed based on the combination or multiscale hybrid frameworks. However, most of these hybrid models cannot easily cast a perfect reflection of erratic fluctuation in carbon trading schemes due to lack of judgment on the trend or inaccurate trend reconstruction. In this study, a novel filter-based modeling with Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, that can identify repeated up and down structural features around a certain carbon price, negotiates the obstacle of the parallel-series hybridization concerning the linear and the nonlinear model identification. The residual decomposition scheme with adaptive noise is carried out on the random and nonlinear component for error correction to filter-based models. Moreover, Bayesian optimization adjusts the structure of seven single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) and the inputs to provide the best generalization performance. The proposed filter-hybrid model using kernel extreme learning machine as the final nonlinear integrator has better stability to the parameters, and has the superiority over the parallel-series and allocation-based models from a statistical perspective. Comparing with existing data-driven models, our proposed model is competitive in view of prediction accuracy and time cost in the majority of carbon futures trading cases.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Convergence of the Backward Deep BSDE Method with Applications to Optimal Stopping Problems,"The optimal stopping problem is one of the core problems in financial markets, with broad applications such as pricing American and Bermudan options. The deep BSDE method [J. Han, A. Jentzen, and W. E, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 115 (2018), pp. 8505--8510] has shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic differential equations and has inspired many applications. However, the method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward manner, which cannot be used for optimal stopping problems that in general require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper [H. Wang et al., Deep Learning-Based BSDE Solver for LIBOR Market Model with Application to Bermudan Swaption Pricing and Hedging, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically, (1) we derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and (2) we give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which present consistent performance with the proved theory.",2023
What do the AI methods tell us about predicting price volatility of key natural resources: Evidence from hyperparameter tuning,"Volatility plays a significant role in pricing derivatives, managing portfolio risk, and using hedging strategies in the financial markets. As a result, it is imperative to precisely estimate the volatility of key natural resources, including crude oil, gold, copper, natural gas, and silver. The likelihood of some countries' budget deficits exceeding permissible levels increased due to recent uncertainties brought on by geo-political threats. This article employs a hybrid model of LSTM-GJR-GARCH (1,1) with hyperparameter tuning to forecast the volatility of the prices of significant natural resources using daily closing prices for crude oil, natural gas, silver, copper, and gold from January 2012 to July 2022. Our results demonstrate that, compared to utilising standard LSTM-GJR-GARCH, employing hyperparameter adjustment increases volatility predictions by an average of 40%-70%. We also looked at the connection between the geo-political risk index and the overall connectedness of natural resources. Our findings suggest that geo-political risk uncertainty does not account for the overall intercon-nectedness of natural resources' prices. Because they may better understand future volatility and manage their portfolios and budgets by estimating the price volatility of natural resources, our findings are important for politicians, governments, and investors.",2023

PSECMAC: A novel self-organizing multiresolution associative memory architecture,"The cerebellum constitutes a vital part of the human brain system that possesses the capability to model highly nonlinear physical dynamics. The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) associative memory network is a computational model inspired by the neurophysiological properties of the cerebellum, and it has been widely used for control, optimization, and various pattern recognition tasks. However, the CMAC network's highly regularized computing structure often leads to the Following: 1) a suboptimal modeling accuracy, 2) poor memory utilization, and 3) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Previous attempts to address these shortcomings have limited success and the proposed solutions often introduce a high operational complexity to the CMAC network. This paper presents a novel neurophysiologically inspired associative memory architecture named pseudo-self-evolving CMAC (PSECMAC) that nonuniformly allocates its computing cells to overcome the architectural deficiencies encountered by the CMAC network. The nonuniform memory allocation scheme employed by the proposed PSECMAC network is inspired by the cerebellar experience-driven synaptic plasticity phenomenon observed in the cerebellum, where significantly higher densities of synaptic connections are located in the frequently accessed regions. In the PSECMAC network, this biological synaptic plasticity phenomenon is emulated by employing a data-driven adaptive memory quantization scheme that defines its computing structure. A neighborhood-based activation process is subsequently implemented to facilitate the learning and computation of the PSECMAC structure. The training stability of the PSECMAC network is theoretically assured by the proof of its learning convergence, which will be presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently bench-marked against the CMAC network and several representative CMAC variants on three real-life applications, namely, pricing of currency futures option, banking failure classification, and modeling of the glucose-insulin dynamics of the human glucose metabolic process. The experimental results have strongly demonstrated the effectiveness of the PSECMAC network in addressing the architectural deficiencies of (he CMAC network by achieving significant improvements in the memory utilization, output accuracy its well as the generalization capability of the network.",2008
DeepPricing: pricing convertible bonds based on financial time-series generative adversarial networks,"Convertible bonds are an important segment of the corporate bond market, however, as hybrid instruments, convertible bonds are difficult to value because they depend on variables related to the underlying stock, the fixed-income part, and the interaction between these components. Besides, embedded options, such as conversion, call, and put provisions are often restricted to certain periods, may vary over time, and are subject to additional path-dependent features of the state variables. Moreover, the most challenging problem in convertible bond valuation is the underlying stock return process modeling as it retains various complex statistical properties. In this paper, we propose DeepPricing, a novel data-driven convertible bonds pricing model, which is inspired by the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), to address the above challenges. The method introduces a new financial time-series generative adversarial networks (FinGAN), which is able to reproduce risk-neutral stock return process that retains the unique statistical properties such as the fat-tailed distributions, the long-range dependence, and the asymmetry structure etc., and then transit to its risk-neutral distribution. Thus it is more flexible and accurate to capture the dynamics of the underlying stock return process and keep the rich set of real-world convertible bond specifications compared with previous model-driven models. The experiments on the Chinese convertible bond market demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepPricing model. Compared with the convertible bond market prices, our model has a better convertible bonds pricing performance than both model-driven models, i.e. Black-Scholes, the constant elasticity of variance, GARCH, and the state-of-the-art GAN-based models, i.e. FinGAN-MLP, FinGAN-LSTM. Moreover, our model has a better fitting capacity for higher-volatility convertible bonds and the overall convertible bond market implied volatility smirk, especially for equity-liked convertible bonds, convertible bonds trading in the bull market, and out-of-the-money convertible bonds. Furthermore, the Long-Short and Long-Only investment strategies based on our model earn a significant annualized return with 41.16% and 31.06%, respectively, for the equally-weighted portfolio during the sample period.",2022
On solving the suburban commuting problem in megacities: Integrating ridesharing with urban rail transit,"The increasing spatial separation between workplaces and residences, coupled with the continued rise in motor vehicle ownership, has significantly strained urban traffic during rush hours. Suburban commuters, in particular, experience prolonged travel times. To enhance suburban commuting efficiency and alleviate congestion, this paper introduces a novel approach to address the Suburban Commuting Problem (SCP) in megacities. The proposed solution integrates ride-sharing with urban rail transit (URT) systems. By promoting ridesharing in suburban areas, commuters can broaden their options for URT stations, no longer restricted to the nearest but often overcrowded end stations. This approach enhances the accessibility of URT and helps alleviate queuing congestion at end stations. Consequently, this approach shortens travel times for suburban commuters. We formulate the SCP as an arc-flow mixed-integer linear programming model, as well as a set-partitioning formulation. We introduce a tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm based on the set-partitioning approach to accurately solve the SCP. To expedite the solution process for the pricing sub-problem, we devise a tailored label-setting algorithm incorporating a bi-directional search strategy. Finally, we evaluate our model and algorithm's performance through extensive computational experiments and provide valuable managerial insights. The case results based on part of road network in Beijing indicate that the proposed optimized solution for the integrated commuting mode can reduce vehicle commuting distance by 34.65%, thereby mitigating traffic congestion and reducing pollutant emissions.",2025
Maturity grading of jujube for industrial applications harnessing deep learning,"PurposeTo develop and examine an efficient and reliable jujube grading model with reduced computational time, which could be utilized in the food processing and packaging industries to perform quick grading and pricing of jujube as well as for the other similar types of fruits.Design/methodology/approachThe whole process begins with manual analysis and collection of four jujube grades from the jujube tree, in addition to this jujube image acquisition was performed utilizing MVS which is further followed by image pre-processing and augmentation tasks. Eventually, classification models (i.e. proposed model, from scratch and pre-trained VGG16 and AlexNet) were trained and validated over the original and augmented datasets to discriminate the jujube into maturity grades.FindingsThe highest success rates reported over the original and augmented datasets were 97.53% (i.e. error of 2.47%) and 99.44% (i.e. error of 0.56%) respectively using Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.003.Research limitations/implicationsThe investigation relies upon a single view of the jujube image and the outer appearance of the jujube. In the future, multi-view image capturing system could be employed for the model training/validation.Practical implicationsDue to the vast functional derivatives of jujube, the identification of maturity grades of jujube is paramount in the fruit industry, functional food production industries and pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the proposed model which is practically feasible and easy to implement could be utilized in such industries.Originality/valueThis research examines the performance of proposed CNN models for selected optimizer and learning rates for the grading of jujube maturity into four classes and compares them with the classical models to depict the sublime model in terms of accuracy, the number of parameters, epochs and computational time. After a thorough investigation of the models, it was discovered that the proposed model transcends both classical models in all aspects for both the original and augmented datasets utilizing Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.003.",2024
