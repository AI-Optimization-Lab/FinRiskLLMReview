Can ChatGPT improve investment decisions? From a portfolio management perspective,"We examine ChatGPT, a prominent Large Language Model (LLM), in supporting portfolio management with a focus on asset selection and diversification through quantitative methods. We use ChatGPT to select assets from various asset classes and evaluate the diversification effect of its selections. Our results suggest that ChatGPT's selections are statistically significantly better in diversity index than randomly selected assets. We also construct portfolios based on ChatGPT's selections and find that they outperform portfolios built on randomly selected assets. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the role of LLMs like ChatGPT as potential assistants for portfolio managers.",2024
Data-driven portfolio management for motion pictures industry: A new data-driven optimization methodology using a large language model as the expert,"Portfolio management is one of the unresponded problems of the Motion Pictures Industry (MPI). To design an optimal portfolio for an MPI distributor, it is essential to predict the box office of each project. Moreover, for an accurate box office prediction, it is critical to consider the effect of the celebrities involved in each MPI project, which was impossible with any precedent expert-based method. Additionally, the asymmetric characteristic of MPI data decreases the performance of any predictive algorithm. In this paper, firstly, the fame score of the celebrities is determined using a large language model. Then, to tackle the asymmetric character of MPI's data, projects are classified. Furthermore, the box office prediction takes place for each class of projects. Finally, using a hybrid multi-attribute decision-making technique, the preferability of each project for the distributor is calculated, and benefiting from a bi-objective optimization model, the optimal portfolio is designed. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using a dataset of movies released in the United States from 1980 to 2020 and employed the proposed approach to predict box office performance. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy and provides a robust framework for effective portfolio management.",2024
Can AI beat a naive portfolio? An experiment with anonymized data,"Using anonymized data from the United States (U.S.) market, we evaluate the performance of Google's main LLM (Large Language Model) Gemini 1.5 Flash in making investment decisions. Unlike other studies, we query the LLM for different investment horizons (1 to 36 months) and types of financial information (financial data, price data, and a combination of both). Running a total of 30,000 simulations for 1,522 companies over 20 years of data, we find that Gemini does not consistently outperform a naive portfolio and the S&P 500 index in terms of returns and Sharpe ratios. Additionally, our findings indicate a decline in risk adjusted investment performance as the investment horizon extends.",2025
TREND-HEURISTIC REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR NEWS-ORIENTED STOCK PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT,"Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) methods have brought significant performance gains for stock portfolio management (PM) because they effectively utilize historical price information and directly generate portfolio weights. We found, however, that there is still great room for improvement in how to fully consider the impact of financial news and stock trends on PM while avoiding model instability caused by feature disparity and fragile convergence due to RL itself. Addressing this allows us to develop more profitable and robust PM strategies. To this end, we propose TrendTrader, a novel RL framework for news-oriented stock portfolio management with trend heuristics. Specifically, TrendTrader utilizes a large language model (LLM) to obtain sentiment scores of stock news and generates heterogeneous contexts based on global sentiment embedding, which enhances model stability in processing multimodal features. Further, TrendTrader incorporates trend heuristics into both the network architecture and the reward function, while combining supervised learning and reinforcement learning in the form of incremental training to facilitate policy network convergence. Extensive experiments in the U.S. market and the China market verify the state-of-the-art performance of TrendTrader.",2024
FinLlama: LLM-Based Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading,"Online sources of financial news have a profound influence on both market movements and trading decisions. Standard sentiment analysis employs a lexicon-based approach to aid financial decisions, but struggles with context sensitivity and word ordering. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but are not finance-specific and require significant computational resources. To this end, we introduce a finance specific LLM framework, based on the Llama 2 7B foundational model, in order to benefit from its generative nature and comprehensive language manipulation. Such a generator-discriminator scheme, referred to as FinLlama, both classifies sentiment valence and quantifies its strength, offering a nuanced insight into financial news. The FinLlama model is fine-tuned on supervised financial sentiment analysis data, to make it handle the complexities of financial lexicon and context, and is equipped with a neural network-based decision mechanism. The subsequent parameter-efficient fine-tuning optimises trainable parameters, thus minimising computational and memory requirements without sacrificing accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of FinLlama to increase market returns in portfolio management scenarios, yielding high-return and resilient portfolios, even during volatile periods.",2024
What if ChatGPT were a quant asset manager,"Even though large language models such as ChatGPT are not specifically trained for analyzing asset returns or recommending stocks, it may still provide additional insight into making investment decisions. In this study, we propose a quantitative investment approach that incorporates recommendations from ChatGPT. Based on ChatGPT's general understanding of economy and financial market movements, we ask ChatGPT to recommend asset classes under various economic conditions. Our empirical results show that asset class recommendations based on economic indicators of ChatGPT can improve portfolio efficiency.",2023

A preliminary test of ChatGPT's ESG literacy,"PurposeMotivated by recent research on the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interplay of financial activities and ESG issues, we examine ChatGPT's ability to assist the public, investors, corporate boards, shareholders and companies with ESG-related issues.Design/methodology/approachWe conduct a preliminary test of ChatGPT's knowledge of ESG by feeding ChatGPT with questions from three sources: Bloomberg, Corporate Finance Institute and Alison.com. We compare ChatGPT-4o mini to random guessing, Google's Gemini and ChatGPT-4o. We test ChatGPT-4o mini's familiarity with Bloomberg terminal functions related to ESG.FindingsWe find ChatGPT's accuracy is 100% on Bloomberg questions. We also find that ChatGPT-4o mini's performance is slightly better than that of Gemini and ChatGPT-4o. However, we document that ChatGPT-4o mini sometimes fabricates non-existing functions, which is evidence of hallucinations, a built-in flaw of ChatGPT. Lastly, we show that ChatGPT-4o mini can analyze Bloomberg terminal screen images, assess companies' actual ESG reports and draft CEO compensation contracts with integrated ESG metrics.Originality/valueOur study is the first attempt to test ChatGPT's knowledge in the domain of ESG. Our findings suggest the potential use of ChatGPT by the public to educate themselves on ESG issues, by investors to integrate ESG in portfolio construction, by corporate boards to incorporate ESG metrics in CEO compensation contracts, by companies to file ESG reports to regulators, by ESG-conscious shareholders to engage the management, etc.",2025
Does ChatGPT provide better advice than robo-advisors?,"We develop three investor profiles with different risk attitudes and consult ChatGPT and 17 roboadvisors to recommend an investment portfolio. We compare the recommendations with a benchmark derived from academic literature. ChatGPT's recommendations align with the three investor profiles and the benchmark. In contrast, only three out of the 17 robo-advisors come close to meeting the benchmark for all three investor profiles. Three robo-advisors fail to meet the benchmark for all investor profiles. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT provides better financial advice for one-time investments than robo-advisors. A policy implication is to clearly disclose that independent sophisticated chatbots can be recommended as a trustworthy source of information for retail investors.",2024
The Comparative Diagnostic Capability of Large Language Models in Otolaryngology,"Objectives: Evaluate and compare the ability of large language models (LLMs) to diagnose various ailments in otolaryngology. Methods: We collected all 100 clinical vignettes from the second edition of Otolaryngology Cases-The University of Cincinnati Clinical Portfolio by Pensak et al. With the addition of the prompt Provide a diagnosis given the following history, we prompted ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard, and Bing-GPT4 to provide a diagnosis for each vignette. These diagnoses were compared to the portfolio for accuracy and recorded. All queries were run in June 2023. Results: ChatGPT-3.5 was the most accurate model (89% success rate), followed by Google Bard (82%) and Bing GPT (74%). A chi-squared test revealed a significant difference between the three LLMs in providing correct diagnoses (p = 0.023). Of the 100 vignettes, seven require additional testing results (i.e., biopsy, non-contrast CT) for accurate clinical diagnosis. When omitting these vignettes, the revised success rates were 95.7% for ChatGPT-3.5, 88.17% for Google Bard, and 78.72% for Bing-GPT4 (p = 0.002). Conclusions: ChatGPT-3.5 offers the most accurate diagnoses when given established clinical vignettes as compared to Google Bard and Bing-GPT4. LLMs may accurately offer assessments for common otolaryngology conditions but currently require detailed prompt information and critical supervision from clinicians. There is vast potential in the clinical applicability of LLMs; however, practitioners should be wary of possible hallucinations and misinformation in responses.",2024

A systematic approach to predicting NFT prices using time series forecasting and macroeconomic factors in digital assets,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained mainstream attention in the fintech community, but there is little research on their statistical properties. This study investigates the long-memory characteristics of NFT returns and volatility, focusing on their potential for predicting price movements. As NFTs do not conform to traditional models, understanding their unique features is crucial for comprehending complex market dynamics. This study aims to reveal the impact of macroeconomic factors on NFT prices, understand their correlation and develop predictive models using autoregression and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This research utilized datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Christie's, Dune, and Google Trends. Correlation and p value tests revealed strong relationships between NFT prices and variables such as weekly volume, pandemics, inflation and security. The Baseline Model using autoregression with NFT volume, security and technology factors outperformed all other models demonstrating the speculative volatility of NFTs. The Transformer Model using transformers, an architecture used by ChatGPT, Gemini and Stable Diffusion, showed high accuracy with less feature selection and preprocessing efforts. This study provides a novelty using a systematic approach for researchers to perform financial forecasting and contributes to the scarce literature on NFTs. This research offers valuable insights to investors and private agents regarding the right economic conditions for NFT investments by reducing portfolio risks and making informed decisions. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study to utilize time-series transformers for forecasting NFTs based on macroeconomic factors.",2025
