Machine Learning Solutions for Fast Real Estate Derivatives Pricing,"The rapid development of machine learning provides new ideas to solve the challenges in pricing financial derivatives, which remains a major obstacle to the further development of real estate derivatives. Previous studies for pricing real estate derivatives rely on classical parametrical models, which have the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and unrealistic model assumptions. However, machine learning does not rely on model parameters and quickly prices real estate derivatives by learning data samples. This paper compares four machine learning methods (neural network, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, support vector regression and random forest) in pricing derivatives and finds that neural network method can price real estate index options with higher accuracy and more stability. Studies of pricing efficiency show that neural networks are more computationally efficient than simulation methods for the same computational accuracy. Under the condition that the number of prediction samples increases, the computation time of the neural network is basically unchanged, and the computation efficiency is improved more significantly than that of the simulation method. Similar results are obtained by the neural network method in the process of pricing real estate index options with stochastic interest rate. Moreover, neural networks do not decrease computational efficiency as computational complexity increases.",2024
Pricing cryptocurrency options with machine learning regression for handling market volatility,"Pricing cryptocurrency options, crucial for risk management and market stabilization, presents unique challenges due to specific underlying dynamics like the inversion of the leverage effect. Classical option pricing models like Black-Scholes and Heston struggle to address these dynamics due to their set of assumptions. This study introduces machine learning models for options pricing, specifically regression -tree methods. A data -driven machine learning model can incorporate high -frequency volatility estimators into the input set to enhance pricing accuracy. By integrating these estimators, machine learning models can capture the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets more effectively than classical pricing approaches. The comparative analysis reveals that equity options are easier to price, clearly indicating inefficiencies in the cryptocurrency option market, which confirms the challenges in achieving accurate pricing. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models in adapting to the unique characteristics of emerging asset classes, suggesting a shift towards more data -oriented pricing methodologies",2024
Generative Bayesian neural network model for risk-neutral pricing of American index options,"Financial models with stochastic volatility or jumps play a critical role as alternative option pricing models for the classical Black-Scholes model, which have the ability to fit different market volatility structures. Recently, machine learning models have elicited considerable attention from researchers because of their improved prediction accuracy in pricing financial derivatives. We propose a generative Bayesian learning model that incorporates a prior reflecting a risk-neutral pricing structure to provide fair prices for the deep ITM and the deep OTM options that are rarely traded. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study to compare classical financial option models with machine learning models in terms of model estimation and prediction using S&P 100 American put options from 2003 to 2012. Results indicate that machine learning models demonstrate better prediction performance than the classical financial option models. Especially, we observe that the generative Bayesian neural network model demonstrates the best overall prediction performance.",2019
On the pricing of capped volatility swaps using machine learning techniques,"A capped volatility swap is a forward contract on an asset's capped, annualized, realized volatility, over a predetermined period of time. This paper presents data-driven machine learning techniques for pricing such capped volatility swaps, using unique data sets comprising both the strike price of contracts at initiation and the daily observed prices of running contracts. Additionally, the developed model can serve as a validation tool for external volatility swap prices, flagging prices that deviate significantly from the estimated value. In order to predict the capped, future, realized volatility, we explore distributional information on the underlying asset, specifically by extracting information from the implied volatilities and market-implied moments of the asset. The pricing performance of tree-based machine learning techniques and a Gaussian process regression model is evaluated in a validation setting tailored to the use of financial data.",2024
APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING: AN ANALYSIS OF ASIAN OPTIONS PRICING USING NEURAL NETWORK,"Pricing Asian Option is imperative to researchers, analysts, traders and any other related experts involved in the option trading markets and the academic field. Not only trading highly affected by the accuracy of the price of Asian options but also portfolios that involve hedging of commodity. Several attempts have been made to model the Asian option prices with closed-form over the past twenty years such as the Kemna-Vorst Model and Levy Approximation. Although today the two closed-form models are still widely used, their accuracy and reliability are called into question. The reason is simple; the Kemna-Vorst model is derived with an assumption of geometric mean of the stocks. In practice, Average Priced Options are mostly arithmetic and thus always have a volatility high than the volatility of a geometric mean making the Asian options always underpriced. On the other hand, the Levy Approximation using Monte Carlo Simulation as a benchmark, do not perform well when the product of the sigma (volatility) and square root maturity of the underlying is larger than 0.2. When the maturity of the option enlarges, the performance of the Levy Approximation largely deteriorates. If the closed-form models could be improved, higher frequency trading of Asian option will become possible. Moreover, building neural networks for different contracts of Asian Options allows reuse of computed prices and large-scale portfolio management that involves many contracts. In this thesis, we use Neural Network to fill the gap between the price of a closed-form model and that of an Asian option. The significance of this method answers two interesting questions. First, could an Asian option trader with a systematic behavior in pricing learned from previous quotes improve his pricing or trading performance in the future? Second, will a training set of previous data help to improve the performance of a financial model? We perform two simulation experiments and show that the performance of the closed-form model is significantly improved. Moreover, we extend the learning process to real data quote. The use of Neural Network highly improves the accuracy of the traditional closed-form model. The model's original price is not so much accurate as what we estimate using Neural network and could not capture the high volatility effectively; still, it provides a relative reasonable fit to the problem (Especially the Levy Model). The analysis shows that the Neural Network Algorithms we used affect the results significantly.",2017
Multi-criteria classification for pricing European options,"This paper builds a novel multi-criteria, non-parametric classification framework in order to improve the accuracy of pricing European options. The proposed approach is based on classifying financial options according to their implied volatility, time to maturity and moneyness. Using a recent data set for the daily S&P 500 index call options, the multi-criteria modular neural network model demonstrates its superior out-of-sample pricing performance relative to competing parametric and non-parametric models. By observing the model's pricing errors across various option types, the analysis provides additional insights into pricing biases and stresses the importance of selecting appropriate classification criteria.",2016
Pricing options with a new hybrid neural network model,"A novel hybrid option pricing model using a deep learning neural network has been developed. The hybrid model keeps the traditional option pricing model with the same input parameters while simultaneously adjusting the model with neural network methods to improve accuracy when applied to real market data, especially in OTM options. The new hybrid model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to both traditional parametric and non-parametric option pricing models for both Call and Put options across all moneyness levels. The empirical results of the hybrid model provide an explanation for the deviation from the Put-Call parity observed in real market data.",2024
An Iteration Algorithm for American Options Pricing Based on Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we present an iteration algorithm for the pricing of American options based on reinforcement learning. At each iteration, the method approximates the expected discounted payoff of stopping times and produces those closer to optimal. In the convergence analysis, a finite sample bound of the algorithm is derived. The algorithm is evaluated on a multi-dimensional Black-Scholes model and a symmetric stochastic volatility model, the numerical results implied that our algorithm is accurate and efficient for pricing high-dimensional American options.",2022
Gridifying Classification-Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing high-dimensional Bermudan-American options,"Among derivative financial contracts, the widely traded in the financial markets are the Bermudan-American options. However, pricing high-dimensional Bermudan-American options is quite computationally intensive and using traditional computing infrastructures may take up to hours for these computations. This can result in potential financial losses, further weakening the competitiveness of an organization. Several parallel approaches for pricing have been practiced utilizing parallel or cluster computing techniques. We aim to address this problem in the context of grid computing, relying on the ProActive Java distributed computing platform. We parallelize the Classification-Monte Carlo algorithm, which relies on classification techniques front the machine learning domain, for pricing Bermudan-American options. Consequently, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning techniques, Boosting and Support Vector Machines, and compare the numerical results with respect to accuracy, speed up and their applicability in the grid settings. Furthermore, the paper also contributes to the numerical experiments of a high-dimensional Bermudan-American option with 40 underlying assets.",2008
Pricing VIX options with volatility clustering,"We investigate the valuation of volatility index (VIX) options by developing a model with a self-exciting Hawkes process that allows for clustering in the VIX. In the proposed framework, we find semianalytical expressions for the characteristic function and forward characteristic function, and then we solve the pricing problem of standard-start and forward-start options via the fast Fourier transform. The empirical results provide evidence to support the significance of accounting for volatility clustering when pricing VIX options.",2020
Option Pricing Using LSTM: A Perspective of Realized Skewness,"Deep learning has drawn great attention in the financial field due to its powerful ability in nonlinear fitting, especially in the studies of asset pricing. In this paper, we proposed a long short-term memory option pricing model with realized skewness by fully considering the asymmetry of asset return in emerging markets. It was applied to price the ETF50 options of China. In order to emphasize the improvement of this model, a comparison with a parametric method, such as Black-Scholes (BS), and machine learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forests and recurrent neural network (RNN), was conducted. Moreover, we also took the characteristic of heavy tail into consideration and studied the effect of realized kurtosis on pricing to prove the robustness of the skewness. The empirical results indicate that realized skewness significantly improves the pricing performance of LSTM among moneyness states except for in-the-money call options. Specifically, the LSTM model with realized skewness outperforms the classical method and other machine learning methods in all metrics.",2023
A nonparametric kernel regression approach for pricing options on stock market index,"Previous options studies typically assume that the dynamics of the underlying asset price follow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) when pricing options on stocks, stock indices, currencies or futures. However, there is mounting empirical evidence that the volatility of asset price or return is far from constant. This article, in contrast to studies that use parametric approach for option pricing, employs nonparametric kernel regression to deal with changing volatility and, accordingly, prices options on stock index. Specifically, we first estimate nonparametrically the volatility of asset return in the GBM based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) kernel estimator. Then, based on the N-W estimates for the volatility, we use Monte Carlo simulation to compute option prices under different settings. Finally, we compare the index option prices under our nonparametric model with those under the Black-Scholes model and the Stein-Stein model.",2016
A comparison of neural network model selection strategies for the pricing of S&P 500 stock index options,"This paper compares a number of neural network model selection approaches on the basis of pricing S&P 500 stock index options. For the choice of the optimal architecture of the neural network, we experiment with a top-down pruning technique as well as two bottom-up strategies that start with simple models and gradually complicate the architecture if data indicate so. We adopt methods that base model selection on statistical hypothesis testing and information criteria and we compare their performance to a simple heuristic pruning technique. In the first set of experiments, neural network models are employed to fit the entire options surface and in the second they are used as parts of a hybrid intelligence scheme that combines a neural network model with theoretical option-pricing hints.",2007
American option pricing using multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine,"An option is the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date. The field of option pricing produces a challenge because of the complexity with pricing American so,led options which cannot be done by the Black-Scholes equations for option pricing. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network has been used before to price these Options with limited success. In this paper we will compare the performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and a Support Vector Machine in pricing American styled options. It was found that a Support Vector Machine approach provided much better results than that found with Multi-Layer Perceptrons.",2004
One Parameter Selection Method of the BP Neural Network on Real Options Pricing,"Based on the theory of BP neural network, the evaluation prediction model of real options pricing was established. Some quantized and non-quantized factors were all considered into the model such as evaluation value uncertainty, investment cost, investment opportunity duration, share degree, environment risk and so on. With one given example, the input parameters of the model were optimized by means of genetic algorithm and the detailed input parameters optimization process was also pointed out by dint of one calculation flow chart. The results show that the method not only guarantees the precision of calculation, but also reduces the number of input variables in the prediction model. At the same time, it can avoid that the calculation does not converge because of lots of input parameters to the prediction model. In addition, this can also reduce the subjectivity of the Black-Scholes model and make the evaluation of real options pricing more accurate. As a result, one good prediction effect has been obtained again.",2014
Pricing high-dimensional American options by kernel ridge regression,"In this paper, we propose using kernel ridge regression (KRR) to avoid the step of selecting basis functions for regression-based approaches in pricing high-dimensional American options by simulation. Our contribution is threefold. Firstly, we systematically introduce the main idea and theory of KRR and apply it to American option pricing for the first time. Secondly, we show how to use KRR with the Gaussian kernel in the regression-later method and give the computationally efficient formulas for estimating the continuation values and the Greeks. Thirdly, we propose to accelerate and improve the accuracy of KRR by performing local regression based on the bundling technique. The numerical test results show that our method is robust and has both higher accuracy and efficiency than the Least Squares Monte Carlo method in pricing high-dimensional American options.",2020
Sequential tracking in pricing financial options using model based and neural network approaches,This paper shows how the prices of option contracts traded in financial markets can be tracked sequentially by means of the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm. I consider call and put. option pairs with identical strike price and time of maturity as a two output nonlinear system. The Black-Scholes approach popular in Finance literature and the Radial Basis Functions neural network are used in modelling the nonlinear system generating these observations. I show how both these systems may be identified recursively using the EKF algorithm. I present results of simulations on some FTSE 100 Index options data and discuss the implications of viewing the pricing problem in this sequential manner.,1997
Machine learning for pricing American options in high-dimensional Markovian and non-Markovian models,"In this paper we propose two efficient techniques which allow one to compute the price of American basket options. In particular, we consider a basket of assets that follow a multi-dimensional Black-Scholes dynamics. The proposed techniques, called GPR Tree (GRP-Tree) and GPR Exact Integration (GPR-EI), are both based on Machine Learning, exploited together with binomial trees or with a closed form formula for integration. Moreover, these two methods solve the backward dynamic programing problem considering a Bermudan approximation of the American option. On the exercise dates, the value of the option is first computed as the maximum between the exercise value and the continuation value and then approximated by means of Gaussian Process Regression. The two methods mainly differ in the approach used to compute the continuation value: a single step of the binomial tree or integration according to the probability density of the process. Numerical results show that these two methods are accurate and reliable in handling American options on very large baskets of assets. Moreover we also consider the rough Bergomi model, which provides stochastic volatility with memory. Despite that this model is only bidimensional, the whole history of the process impacts on the price, and how to handle all this information is not obvious at all. To this aim, we present how to adapt the GPR-Tree and GPR-EI methods and we focus on pricing American options in this non-Markovian framework.",2020
A comparison of machine learning and econometric models for pricing perpetual Bitcoin futures and their application to algorithmic trading,"Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures contracts are highly leveraged speculative trading instruments with daily market trading of $45 Billion. BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%-8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used. On average, the market direction is predicted correctly 85% of the time by the best model. Finally, the trading technique is market neutral, in that it gives large positive returns, with low SD, in both bull and bear markets.",2023
Barrier Options and Greeks: Modeling with Neural Networks,"This paper proposes a non-parametric technique of option valuation and hedging. Here, we replicate the extended Black-Scholes pricing model for the exotic barrier options and their corresponding Greeks using the fully connected feed-forward neural network. Our methodology involves some benchmarking experiments, which result in an optimal neural network hyperparameter that effectively prices the barrier options and facilitates their option Greeks extraction. We compare the results from the optimal NN model to those produced by other machine learning models, such as the random forest and the polynomial regression; the output highlights the accuracy and the efficiency of our proposed methodology in this option pricing problem. The results equally show that the artificial neural network can effectively and accurately learn the extended Black-Scholes model from a given simulated dataset, and this concept can similarly be applied in the valuation of complex financial derivatives without analytical solutions.",2023
Regression methods in pricing American and Bermudan options using consumption processes,"Numerical algorithms for the efficient pricing of multidimensional discrete-time American and Bermudan options are constructed using regression methods and a new approach for computing upper bounds of the options' price. Using the sample space with payoffs at optimal stopping times, we propose sequential estimates for continuation values, values of the consumption process, and stopping times on the sample paths. The approach allows the constructing of both lower and upper bounds for the price by Monte Carlo simulations. The algorithms are tested by pricing Bermudan max-calls and swaptions in the Libor market model.",2009
EXTENDING THE FEATURE SET OF A DATA-DRIVEN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL OF PRICING FINANCIAL OPTIONS,"Prices of derivative contracts, such as options, traded in the financial markets are expected to have complex relationships to fluctuations in the values of the underlying assets, the time to maturity and type of exercise of the contracts as well as other macroeconomic variables. Hutchinson, Lo and Poggio showed in 1994 that a non-parametric artificial neural network may be trained to approximate this complex functional relationship. Here, we consider this model with additional inputs relevant to the pricing of options and show that the accuracy of approximation may indeed be improved. We consider volume traded, historic volatility, observed interest rates and combinations of these as additional features. In addition to giving empirical results on how the inclusion of these variables helps predicting option prices, we also analyse prediction errors of the different models with volatility and volume traded as inputs, and report an interesting correlation between their contributions.",2016
Learning Bermudans,"American-type financial instruments are often priced with specific Monte Carlo techniques whose efficiency critically depends on the dimensionality of the problem and the available computational power. Our work proposes a novel approach for pricing Bermudan swaptions, well-known interest rate derivatives, using supervised learning algorithms. In particular, we link the price of a Bermudan swaption to its natural hedges, which include the underlying European swaptions, and other relevant financial quantities through supervised learning non-parametric regressions. We explore several algorithms, ranging from linear models to decision tree-based models and neural networks and compare their predictive performances. Our results indicate that all supervised learning algorithms are reliable and fast, with ridge regressor, neural networks, and gradient-boosted regression trees performing the best for the pricing problem. Furthermore, using feature importance techniques, we identify the most important driving factors of a Bermudan swaption price, confirming that the maximum underlying European swaption value is the dominant feature.",2024
A new options pricing method: semi-stochastic kernel regression method with constraints,"This paper presents a unified semi-stochastic kernel regression method for pricing options under general stochastic volatility model. The method combines semi-stochastic sampling for initial asset values with Monte Carlo simulations to construct a least-squares based kernel function regression solution. This approach can not only approximates option prices, but also determines the Greeks of option. The least square problem is augmented with weighted derivative constraints, which enables flexible adjustment of approximate errors for both option prices and Greeks. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed method for the Vanilla option and some exotic options: Asian option, Lookback option, discretely monitored Barrier option and the Basket option with several assets under the stochastic volatility model.",2023
A Review on Regression-based Monte Carlo Methods for Pricing American Options,"In this article we give a review of regression-based Monte Carlo methods for pricing American options. The methods require in a first step that the generally in continuous time formulated pricing problem is approximated by a problem in discrete time, i.e., the number of exercising times of the considered option is assumed to be finite. Then the problem can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem in discrete time, where the optimal stopping time can be expressed by the aid of so-called continuation values. These continuation values represent the price of the option given that the option is exercised after time t conditioned on the value of the price process at time t. The continuation values can be expressed as regression functions, and regression-based Monte Carlo methods apply regression estimates to data generated by the aid of artificial generated paths of the price process in order to approximate these conditional expectations. In this article we describe various methods and corresponding results for estimation of these regression functions.",2010
Improving Non-parametric Option Pricing during the Financial Crisis,"Financial option prices have experienced excessive volatility in response to the recent economic and financial crisis. During the crisis periods, financial markets are, in general, subject to an abrupt regime shift which imposes a significant challenge to option pricing models. In this context, swiftly evolving markets and institutions require valuation models that are capable of recognizing and adapting to such changes. Both parametric and non-parametric pricing models have shown poor forecast ability for options traded in late 1987 and 2008. Surprisingly, the pricing inaccuracy was more pronounced for non-parametric models than for parametric models. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid methodology modular neural network-fuzzy learning vector quantization (MNN-FLVQ) model - that uses the Kohonen unsupervised learning and fuzzy clustering algorithms to classify the S&P 500 stock market index options, and thereby detect a regime shift. In our empirical application, the results for the 2008 financial crisis demonstrate that the MNN-FLVQ model is superior to the competing methods in regards to option pricing during regime shifts.",2012
Pricing VIX derivatives using a stochastic volatility model with a flexible jump structure,"This paper proposes a novel stochastic volatility model with a flexible jump structure. This model allows both contemporaneous and independent arrival of jumps in return and volatility. Moreover, time-varying jump intensities are used to capture jump clustering. In the proposed framework, we provide a semi-analytical solution for the pricing problem of VIX futures and options. Through numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy of our pricing formula and explore the impact of the jump structure on the pricing of VIX derivatives. We find that the correct identification of the market jump structure is crucial for pricing VIX derivatives, and misspecified model setting can yield large errors in pricing.",2023
An empirical examination of the convexity bias in the pricing of interest rate swaps,"This paper examines the convexity bias, caused by the non-linearity of payoffs, in the pricing of interest rate swaps off the Eurocurrency futures curve. The evidence from four major currencies - $, pound, DM and Yen - during 1987-1996 suggests that swaps were initially being priced off the futures curve (ignoring the convexity adjustment); subsequently, the market swap rates drifted below the rates implied by futures prices. After rejecting alternative explanations, we use alternative term structure models to show that the convexity bias is related to the empirically observed swap-futures differential. We interpret these results as evidence of mispricing of swap contracts during the early years, which was eliminated over time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Model-Agnostic Pricing of Exotic Derivatives Using Signatures,"Neural networks hold out the promise of fast and reliable derivative pricing. Such an approach usually involves the supervised learning task of mapping contract and model parameters to derivative prices. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic path-wise approach to derivative pricing using higher-order distribution regression. Our methodology leverages the 2(nd)-order Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a notion of distance between stochastic processes based on path signatures. To overcome the high computational cost of its calculation, we pre-train a neural network that can quickly and accurately compute higher-order MMDs. This allows the combination of distribution regression with neural networks in a computationally feasible way. We test our model on down-and-in barrier options. We demonstrate that our path-wise approach extends well to the high-dimensional case by applying it to rainbow options and autocallables. Our approach has a significant speed-up over Monte Carlo pricing.",2022
Pricing Bermudan options by nonparametric regression: optimal rates of convergence for lower estimates,"The problem of pricing Bermudan options using simulations and nonparametric regression is considered. We derive optimal nonasymptotic bounds for the low biased estimate based on a suboptimal stopping rule constructed from some estimates of the optimal continuation values. These estimates may be of different nature, local or global, with the only requirement being that the deviations of these estimates from the true continuation values can be uniformly bounded in probability. As an illustration, we discuss a class of local polynomial estimates which, under some regularity conditions, yield continuation values estimates possessing the required property.",2011
The non-uniform pricing effect of employee stock options using quantile regression,"Issuing employee stock options (ESOs) transfers equity claims from current stockholders to employees, and thereby dilutes existing shareholder interests. Because employees are motivated to exert additional effort toward better performance, the value of transferred ownership claims proxied by ESO expense represents a cost of generating firm value. There are several econometric issues, most notably including the fact that the disclosed ESO expense is an endogenous variable. Without controlling for the simultaneity problem, inferences based on results from OLS analyses may be misleading. More importantly, a considerable amount of ESO expense data is censored at zero. Such a censoring problem can make the population distribution severely skewed, resulting in estimation bias. Therefore, we need to take into account the censored data issue. No prior studies have considered these two issues simultaneously. Failure to control for both censoring problem and endogeneity could explain the inconsistent results documented in prior studies. In this paper, we use the two-stage quantile regression (QR) proposed by Amemiya (1982) and Powell (1983) to examine possible nonlinear relationships, especially whether conditionally higher-stock price (or better performing) firms show a stronger negative pricing effect of ESO expense (that is, the relation between ESO expense and share price) than conditionally lower-share price firms. Our results suggest that the linear regression model greatly underestimates this negative pricing effect at higher quantiles, so the nonlinear relationship is obscure when using the standard linear model. We also consider alternative interpretations as to why heterogeneity exists in the pricing effect of ESO expense and assess whether our results concur with these explanations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Carbon price forecasting models based on big data analytics,"After the establishment of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) carbon pricing attracted many researchers. This paper aims to develop a prediction model that anticipates future carbon prices given a real-world data set. We treat the carbon pricing issue as part of big data analytics to achieve this goal. We apply three fundamental methodologies to characterize the carbon price. First method is the artificial neural network, which mimics the principle of human brain to process relevant data. As a second approach, we apply the decision tree algorithm. This algorithm is structured through making multiple binary decisions, and it is mostly used for classification. We employ two different decision tree algorithms, namely traditional and conditional, to determine the type of decision tree that gives better results in terms of prediction. Finally, we exploit the random forest, which is a more complex algorithm compared to the decision tree. Similar to the decision tree, we test both traditional and conditional random forest algorithms to analyze their performances. We use Brent crude futures, coal, electricity and natural gas prices, and DAX and S&P Clean Energy Index as explanatory variables. We analyze the variables' effects on carbon price forecasting. According to our results, S&P Clean Energy Index is the most influential variable in explaining the changes in carbon price, followed by DAX Index and coal price. Moreover, we conclude that the traditional random forest is the best algorithm based on all indicators. We provide the details of these methods and their comparisons.",2019
Pricing options on flow forwards by neural networks in a Hilbert space,"We propose a new methodology for pricing options on flow forwards by applying infinite-dimensional neural networks. We recast the pricing problem as an optimisation problem in a Hilbert space of real-valued functions on the positive real line, which is the state space for the term structure dynamics. This optimisation problem is solved by using a feedforward neural network architecture designed for approximating continuous functions on the state space. The proposed neural network is built upon the basis of the Hilbert space. We provide case studies that show its numerical efficiency, with superior performance over that of a classical neural network trained on sampling the term structure curves.",2024
"A comparative analysis of option pricing models: Black-Scholes, Bachelier, and artificial neural networks","Practitioners and academics alike have applied the Black-Scholes model when pricing options practically since its introduction in 1973. The COVID-19 pandemic and the oil futures price crash of April 2020 caused major markets to briefly switch to the less widely known Bachelier model to price derivatives, as the model allows for negative strikes on the underlying. This study evaluates the predictive ability and accuracy of the Bachelier model and the Black-Scholes model when pricing European call options on the Standard & Poor's 500 index using five volatility estimation methods. Moreover, it compares the forecasts of the two parameterized models to a deep feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) which is also used to price such options. Overall, the ANN is statistically superior in its predictive ability relative to both parameterized models, and there is no statistical difference in predictive ability between the Black-Scholes and Bachelier models. These results are of relevance to both academics and participants in the options markets.",2025
Deep learning-based least squares forward-backward stochastic differential equation solver for high-dimensional derivative pricing,"We propose a new forward-backward stochastic differential equation solver for high-dimensional derivative pricing problems by combining a deep learning solver with a least squares regression technique widely used in the least squares Monte Carlo method for the valuation of American options. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our least squares backward deep neural network solver and its capability to produce accurate prices for complex early exercisable derivatives, such as callable yield notes. Our method can serve as a generic numerical solver for pricing derivatives across various asset groups, in particular, as an accurate means for pricing high-dimensional derivatives with early exercise features.",2021
Pricing of derivatives on commodity indices,"This paper introduces a novel method for pricing commodity index derivatives consistently with market prices of derivatives on single commodities. We discuss the Black, mean-reversion and local volatility pricing models with special attention paid to the parameterization of volatility surfaces. We introduce an innovative two step regression approach for model calibration and present theoretical insights on futures correlations. In an empirical case study we perform the pricing of call and barrier options on the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index by replicating the index with a portfolio of correlated single commodities. The choice of these commodity instruments is based on their liquidity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2013
ON THE CONSISTENCY OF REGRESSION-BASED MONTE CARLO METHODS FOR PRICING BERMUDAN OPTIONS IN CASE OF ESTIMATED FINANCIAL MODELS,"In many applications of regression-based Monte Carlo methods for pricing, American options in discrete time parameters of the underlying financial model have to be estimated from observed data. In this paper suitably defined nonparametric regression-based Monte Carlo methods are applied to paths of financial models where the parameters converge toward true values of the parameters. For various Black-Scholes, GARCH, and Levy models it is shown that in this case the price estimated from the approximate model converges to the true price.",2015
Option Pricing Based on GA-BP neural network,"Machine Learning has received widespread attention in the financial field, especially in the issue of option pricing. Compared with the original BSM (Black-Scholes-Merton) option pricing method, this paper introduces the genetic algorithm into the option pricing process based on the characteristics of financial data, and constructs a GA-BP neural network (Neural Networks) option pricing Model and empirical analysis of European call options based on the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index. The research results show that the option price calculation result of the GA-BP neural network algorithm has better accuracy than the BP neural network model or the classic BSM method, while taking into account efficiency, which is helpful to predicting option prices in financial practice to a certain extent.

New solvable stochastic volatility models for pricing volatility derivatives,"In this paper we discuss a new approach to extend a class of solvable stochastic volatility models (SVM). Usually, classical SVM adopt a CEV process for instantaneous variance where the CEV parameter gamma takes just few values: 0-the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 1/2-the Heston (or square root) process, 1-GARCH, and 3/2-the 3/2 model. Some other models, e.g. with gamma = 2 were discovered in Henry-Labord,re (Analysis, geometry, and modeling in finance: advanced methods in option pricing. Chapman & Hall/CRC Financial Mathematics Series, London, 2009) by making connection between stochastic volatility and solvable diffusion processes in quantum mechanics. In particular, he used to build a bridge between solvable superpotentials (the Natanzon superpotentials, which allow reduction of a Schrodinger equation to a Gauss confluent hypergeometric equation) and existing SVM. Here we propose some new models with and demonstrate that using Lie's symmetries they could be priced in closed form in terms of hypergeometric functions. Thus obtained new models could be useful for pricing volatility derivatives (variance and volatility swaps, moment swaps).",2013
Option price forecasting using neural networks,"In this research, forecasting of the option prices of Nikkei 225 index futures is carried out using backpropagation neural networks. Different results in terms of accuracy are achieved by grouping the data differently. The results suggest that for volatile markets a neural network option pricing model outperforms the traditional Black-Scholes model. However, the Black-Scholes model is still good for pricing at-the-money options. In using the neural network model, data partition according to moneyness should be applied. Those who prefer less risk and less returns may use the traditional Black-Scholes model results while those who prefer high risk and high return may choose to use the neural network model results.

How electronic trading affects bid-ask spreads and arbitrage efficiency between index futures and options,"This paper examines the impact of switching to electronic trading on the relative pricing efficiency of Hang Sang Index futures and options contracts traded on the Hong Kong exchange. The study is motivated by the recent shift in 2000 from the pit to an electronic trading platform. Electronic trading leads to lower bid-ask spreads and less price clustering than floor trading in both the options and futures markets. Mispricing between futures and options drops significantly after the change. Quicker correction of mispricing indicates a significant improvement in dynamic inter-market arbitrage efficiency with electronic trading. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2005
SVM-Jacobi for fitting linear combinations of exponential distributions with applications to finance and insurance,"We propose a method called SVM-Jacobi to approximate probability distributions by linear combinations of exponential distributions, associated with a comprehensive asymptotic analysis. In multivariate cases, the multivariate distribution is approximated by linear combinations of products of independent exponential distributions, and the method works effectively. The proposed method has many applications in both quantitative finance and insurance, especially for modeling random time, like default time and remaining lifetime. In addition to the methodology and theoretical analysis, we provide examples of pricing defaultable bonds, European options, credit default swaps, equity-linked death benefits, and calculating the credit value adjustment of credit default swaps. Finally, some numerical results based on real data and simulated data are presented for illustration.",2024
Gradient boosting for quantitative finance,"In this paper, we discuss how tree-based machine learning techniques can be used in the context of derivatives pricing. Gradient boosted regression trees are employed to learn the pricing map for a couple of classical, time-consuming problems in quantitative finance. In particular, we illustrate this methodology by reducing computation times for pricing exotic derivatives products and American options. Once the gradient boosting model is trained, it is used to make fast predictions of new prices. We show that this approach leads to speed-ups of several orders of magnitude, while the loss of accuracy is very acceptable from a practical point of view. In addition to the predictive performance of these methods, we acknowledge the importance of interpretability of pricing models. For both applications, we therefore look under the hood of the gradient boosting model and elaborate on how the price is constructed and interpreted.",2021
VIX futures pricing based on high-frequency VIX: A hybrid approach combining SVR with parametric models,"We propose a novel hybrid approach for volatility index (VIX) futures pricing by combining support vector regression (SVR) with parametric models. Realized semivariances calculated based on high-frequency VIX are used to characterize the asymmetric shocks of VIX, and the direct pricing framework of the heterogeneous autoregressive model is extended by incorporating realized semivariances. VIX futures prices are first obtained via parametric models, then the predicted prices and realized semivariances are input into SVR to obtain the final predicted values. Empirical results indicate that the combination of SVR with parametric models significantly improves the pricing ability. This indicates the important information of high-frequency VIX and the necessity of combining machine learning methods with parametric models to obtain more accurate predictions.",2023
Media influences on corn futures pricing,"Understanding agricultural commodity futures is crucial for efficient business operations. This study employs textual machine learning on 290,271 articles (2009-2020) focusing on corn markets, aiming to model the impact of news on corn futures pricing. Our novel approach enables the identification of seven distinct topics within corn news, offering a comprehensive view of the news coverage spectrum. Soybean biofuel news notably influences corn prices, while exports, weather and wheat news significantly impact pricing uncertainty. These insights deepen our understanding of factors shaping corn futures and highlight machine learning's potential in agricultural economic analysis, enabling more accurate market predictions and policy decisions.",2024
Predicting the stock price of frontier markets using machine learning and modified Black-Scholes Option pricing model,"The Black-Scholes Option pricing model (BSOPM) has long been in use for valuation of equity options to find the price of stocks. In this work, using BSOPM, we have come up with a comparative analytical approach and numerical technique to find the price of call option and put option and considered these two prices as buying price and selling price of stocks in the frontier markets so that we can predict the stock price (close price). Changes have been made in the model to find the parameters such as 'strike price' and the 'time of expiration' for calculating stock price of frontier markets. To verify the result obtained using modified BSOPM, we have used machine learning approach using the software Rapidminer, where we have adopted different algorithms like the decision tree, ensemble learning method and neural network. It has been observed that, the prediction of close price using machine learning is very similar to the one obtained using BSOPM. Machine learning approach stands out to be a better predictor over BSOPM, because Black-Scholes-Merton equation includes risk and dividend parameter, which changes continuously. We have also numerically calculated volatility. As the price of the stocks goes up due to overpricing, volatility increases at a tremendous rate and when volatility becomes very high; market tends to fall, which can be observed and determined using our modified BSOPM. The proposed modified BSOPM has also been explained based on the analogy of Schrodinger equation (and heat equation) of quantum physics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020
Deep Learning-Based Numerical Methods for High-Dimensional Parabolic Partial Differential Equations and Backward Stochastic Differential Equations,"We study a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in high dimension, which is based on an analogy between the BSDE and reinforcement learning with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition and the solution of the BSDE. The policy function is then approximated by a neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results using TensorFlow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the studied algorithm for several 100-dimensional nonlinear PDEs from physics and finance such as the Allen-Cahn equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.",2017
Detecting and modelling the jump risk of CO2 emission allowances and their impact on the valuation of option on futures contracts,"Modelling CO2 emission allowance prices is important for pricing CO2 emission allowance linked assets in the emissions trading scheme (ETS). Some statistical properties of CO2 emission allowance prices have been discovered in the literature ignoring price jumps. By employing real data from the ETS, this research first detects the jump risk using a jump test and then verifies jump effects in modelling CO2 emission allowance prices by comparing the in-sample and out-of-sample model performance. We suggest a model which can capture the statistical properties of autocorrelation, volatility clustering and jump effects is more appropriate for modelling CO2 emission allowance prices. We establish a general framework for pricing CO2 emission allowance options on futures contracts with these properties and find that the jump risk significantly affects the value of the CO2 emission allowance option on futures contracts. More importantly, we demonstrate that the dynamic jump ARMA-GARCH model can provide more accurate valuations of the CO2 emission allowance options on futures than other models in terms of pricing error.",2016
Deep joint learning valuation of Bermudan swaptions,"This paper addresses the problem of pricing involved financial derivatives by means of advanced deep learning techniques. More precisely, we methodically integrate several sophisticated neural network-based concepts like differential machine learning, Monte Carlo simulation-like training samples and joint learning to come up with an efficient numerical solution. The application of the latter development represents a novelty in the context of computational finance. We also propose a novel design of interdependent neural networks to price early-exercise products, in this case, Bermudan swaptions. The improvements in efficiency and accuracy provided by the approach proposed here are widely illustrated throughout a range of numerical experiments. Moreover, this novel methodology can be extended to the pricing of other financial derivatives.",2025
A Comparison of Artificial Neural Networks and Bootstrap Aggregating Ensembles in a Modern Financial Derivative Pricing Framework,"In this paper, the pricing performances of two learning networks, namely an artificial neural network and a bootstrap aggregating ensemble network, were compared when pricing the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Top 40 European call options in a modern option pricing framework using a constructed implied volatility surface. In addition to this, the numerical accuracy of the better performing network was compared to a Monte Carlo simulation in a separate numerical experiment. It was found that the bootstrap aggregating ensemble network outperformed the artificial neural network and produced price estimates within the error bounds of a Monte Carlo simulation when pricing derivatives in a multi-curve framework setting.",2021
Pricing Bounds for Volatility Derivatives via Duality and Least Squares Monte Carlo,"Derivatives on the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index have gained significant popularity over the last decade. The pricing of volatility derivatives involves evaluating the square root of a conditional expectation which cannot be computed by direct Monte Carlo methods. Least squares Monte Carlo methods can be used, but the sign of the error is difficult to determine. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent technique for computing upper and lower pricing bounds for volatility derivatives. In particular, we first present a general stochastic duality result on payoffs involving convex (or concave) functions. This result also allows us to interpret these contingent claims as a type of chooser options. It is then applied to volatility derivatives along with minor adjustments to handle issues caused by the square root function. The upper bound involves the evaluation of a variance swap, while the lower bound involves estimating a martingale increment corresponding to its hedging portfolio. Both can be achieved simultaneously using a single linear least square regression. Numerical results show that the method works very well for futures, calls and puts under a wide range of parameter choices.",2018
A multi-scale model with feature recognition for the use of energy futures price forecasting,"Energy futures pricing is a critical endeavor in terms of the global economy's trend, the sharp fluctuation of which increases the complexity of price series analysis. The majority of previous research has focused on model integration, data-driven factors and information optimization. It is, however, still not straightforward to provide a robust model for understanding the trend of the energy futures prices due to the multifaceted nature of financial markets. To provide feasibility for energy futures prediction, a multiscale model that integrates the decomposition-ensemble approach and the subcomponents clustering method is proposed, which overcomes the fluctuation position of the energy futures price. The subcomponents clustering method is used to obtain a number of subseries with different frequencies after decomposing the energy futures price series into several subcomponents. The linear model is then used to forecast the trend component, while the machine learning method predicts the nonlinearity at the same time. An examination of the multiscale model yields a plausible interpretation. The discussion and analysis evaluate forecasting dependability and feasibility, demonstrating that the developed multiscale model reduces crude oil futures price forecasting by up to 6.11% and natural gas futures price forecasting by up to 2.05%, respectively.",2023
"A Pragmatical Option Pricing Method Combining Black-Scholes Formula, Time Series Analysis and Artificial Neural Network","Although many theoretical methods were developed to price various derivatives, pricing deviation still remains very high. This paper provides a pragmatical option pricing method by combining skewness and kurtosis adjusted BlackScholes model of Corrado and Su, time series analysis and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The empirical tests in FTSE 100 Index options show that pricing deviation calculated by adjusted Black-Scholes model is still high. After the model is modified by time series analysis and ANN methods, the pricing deviation is reduced, which is much smaller than the previous models. It is suggested that time series analysis and Artificial Neural Network methods can be used in the pragmatical work to make the pricing more fast and precise.",2013
Improved option pricing using bootstrap methods,"A ''hybrid'' neural network is used to predict the difference between the conventionally accepted modified Black option pricing model and observed intraday option prices for stock index option futures. Confidence intervals derived with bootstrap methods are used in a trading strategy which allows only trades outside the estimated range of spurious model fits to be executed. Furthermore, ''hybrid'' neural network option pricing models can improve predictions but have bias which can be reduced with bootstrap methods. A modified bootstrap predictor is indexed by a parameter which allows the predictor to range from a pure bootstrap predictor, to a hybrid predictor, and finally the bagging predictor. Our results show that a modified bootstrap predictor outperforms the hybrid and bagging predictors. Greatly improved performance was observed in particular regions of the input space, namely out of the money options.",1997
Dynamic customer demand management: A reinforcement learning model based on real-time pricing and incentives,"The demand response model proposed in this work offers a game-changing solution to the challenges posed by the unpredictability of renewable energy sources. By combining both pricing and incentives, this model significantly improves the accuracy of demand response strategies, leading to more effective modulation of customer demand. The real-time and time-of-use pricing options presented to customers incentivize them to actively increase or decrease their energy consumption, thereby contributing to the stability of the energy grid. This work also sheds light on the crucial role that characteristic parameters such as the internal or external coincidence factor play in the classification of customers using the k-means algorithm. The reinforcement learning method used in the model not only optimizes prices and incentives, but also ensures that both customers and energy distribution companies benefit equally. A sensitivity analysis of customer elasticity highlights the dynamic interplay between clustering and reinforcement learning algorithms and customer behavior, demonstrating the power and effectiveness of this model. With its innovative approach and cutting-edge techniques, this work sets a new model for demand response and makes a compelling case for the inclusion of prices and incentives in future models.

Do economic statistics contain information to predict stock indexes futures prices and returns? Evidence from Asian equity futures markets,"This research examines the impact of local and international market factors on the pricing of stock indexes futures in East Asian countries. The purpose of this paper is to present a study of the significant factors that determine the major stock indexes futures' prices of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. This study first investigates the relationships between Hang Seng Index Futures, KLCI Futures, SiMSCI Futures, KOSPI Futures, Taiwan Exchange Index Futures and local interest rates, dividend yields, local exchange rates, overnight S&P500 index and a newly constructed index, Asian Tigers Malaysia Index (ATMI). 11 years historical data of stock indexes futures and the economic statistics are studied; 10 years in-sample data are used for testing and developing the pricing models, and 1 year out-of-sample data is used for the purpose of verifying the predicted values of the stock indexes futures. Using simple linear regressions, local interest rates, dividend yields, exchange rates, overnight S&P500 and ATMI are found to have significant impact on these futures contracts. In this research, the next period close is predicted using simple linear regression and non-linear artificial neural network (ANN). An examination of the prediction results using nonlinear autoregressive ANN with exogenous inputs (NARX) shows significant abnormal returns above the passive threshold buy and hold market returns and also above the profits of simple linear regression (SLR). The empirical evidence of this research suggests that economic statistics contain information which can be extracted using a hybrid SLR and NARX trading model to predict futures prices with some degree of confidence for a year forward. This justifies further research and development of pricing models using fundamentally significant economic determinants to predict futures prices.",2021
Evolving possibilistic fuzzy modeling for equity options pricing,"The correct pricing of financial derivatives plays a key role in risk management and in hedge operations. Besides the Black and Scholes closed-form formula simplicity and good results for pricing European options, several of the assumptions used in the method may be unrealistic and influence the results significantly. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper suggests an evolving possibilistic fuzzy modeling (ePFM) approach for European equity options pricing. The approach is based on an extension of the possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering and functional fuzzy rule-based modeling. ePFM employs memberships and typicalities to recursively cluster data, and uses participatory learning to adapt the model structure as a stream data is input. The model does not require any assumptions about data distribution, it is an effective robust method to handle noisy data and outliers in option price dynamics modeling, and it is also capable to access volatility clustering due to its clustering based nature. Computational experiments consider the pricing of European equity options (calls and puts) on preference shares of Petrobras (PETR4), one of the most liquidity options traded in the Brazilian derivatives market. The results show that ePFM is a potential candidate for equity options pricing, with comparable or better performance than the Black and Scholes method and alternative evolving fuzzy approaches.",2016
Consistent time-homogeneous modeling of SPX and VIX derivatives,"This paper shows how to recover a stochastic volatility model (SVM) from a market model of the VIX futures term structure. Market models have more flexibility for fitting of curves than do SVMs, and therefore are better suited for pricing VIX futures and VIX derivatives. But the VIX itself is a derivative of the S&P500 (SPX) and it is common practice to price SPX derivatives using an SVM. Therefore, consistent modeling for both SPX and VIX should involve an SVM that can be obtained by inverting the market model. This paper's main result is a method for the recovery of a stochastic volatility function by solving an inverse problem where the input is the VIX function given by a market model. Analysis will show conditions necessary for there to be a unique solution to this inverse problem. The models are consistent if the recovered volatility function is non-negative. Examples are presented to illustrate the theory, to highlight the issue of negativity in solutions, and to show the potential for inconsistency in non-Markov settings.",2022
Hierarchical Learning for Option Implied Volatility Pricing,"Machine learning has been a popular option implied volatility pricing approach. It brings a good generalization in pricing by avoiding building different models for different options. However, it suffers from a relatively low prediction accuracy besides a model selection issue. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical learning approach to enhance machine learning implied volatility pricing. It is designed for the 'learning-hard' problem and boosts different machine learning models' performance for different option data on behalf of moneyness besides identifying the optimal learning models. In particular, the proposed hierarchical learning can be an excellent way to enhance implied volatility pricing for the option datasets with more noise. In addition, we find out-of-the-money options fit machine learning prediction better than the other options. This pioneering study provides a robust way to enhance implied volatility pricing via machine learning and will inspire similar studies in the future.",2021
Deep equal risk pricing of illiquid derivatives with multiple hedging instruments,"This paper leverages the equal risk pricing (ERP) framework for the valuation of illiquid financial derivatives. Such a method sets the derivative price as the premium, which leads to equal residual optimal hedging risk for agents hedging the long and short positions on the derivative. The inclusion of multiple hedging instruments such as liquid vanilla options in the hedging procedure ensures that information contained in the price of these liquid assets is transferred to the price of the illiquid asset. This property leads to genuine market-consistent pricing, which allows the use of observables (liquid instrument prices) to determine nonobservable prices (ie, that of illiquid derivatives) to be maximized. The ERP problem is solved numerically through deep reinforcement learning. Several numerical experiments are provided to study the properties of equal risk prices of derivatives when multiple options are used as hedging instruments. Notably, the equal risk prices produced with option hedges are typically lower than those obtained through hedges relying exclusively on the underlying asset, which is caused by a reduction in the level of market incompleteness when options become available for trading.",2024
Model risk for European-style stock index options,"In empirical modeling, there have been two strands for pricing in the options literature, namely the parametric and nonparametric models. Often, the support for the nonparametric methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black-Scholes (BS) model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging. Our findings indicate that FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings. There are two routes to explain the superiority of FNN models over the parametric models in forecast settings. These are normormality of return distributions and adaptive learning.",2007
The Effect of Company's Interest Coverage Ratio on the Structural and Reduced-Form Models in Predicting Credit Derivatives Price,"Derivative pricing models use either fixed or variable interest rates at the corporate level to compensate for the devaluation, which results in an estimated accounting profit caused by the cash inflation at the maturity date. These models also fail to take into account the lost opportunity costs, which are considered a deficiency. Accordingly, the present study set out to remove this problem by adding the company's Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) to pricing models, which is the novelty of this study. The research data was extracted from the Bloomberg Terminal for an eight-year period from 2008 to 2015. The statistical population of the research included the North American and European companies recognized as the reference entities for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in the given period, and the statistical sample consisted of 125 companies. The data was analyzed using four Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, namely ANFIS, NNARX, AdaBoost, and SVM. The research results indicated the increased predictive accuracy of the pricing models under scrutiny after adding the ICR. The findings also shed light on the superiority of the intensity model over the structural model in prognosticating the price of CDS contracts.",2022
Predicting Arbitrage-free American Option Prices Using Artificial Neural Network with Pseudo Inputs,"Machine learning models, which have recently been applied to evaluate financial variables, have a major difficulty to accomplish arbitrage-free valuation. We propose an American style option pricing method using multilayer artificial neural networks with arbitrage-free pseudo inputs. The proposed neural network model was trained with samples composed of market data and pseudo grid points generated by the calibrated parametric models. The trained model found arbitrage-free price or nearest price for each strike price and expiration date. We compared the proposed model with a conventional multilayer neural network model in terms of model prediction using S&P 100 American put options from 2012. The proposed model achieved better prediction performance than the conventional neural network model. In addition, prices obtained from the proposed method were much closer to the arbitrage-free prices from the parametric model.",2021
A regularization approach to continuous learning with an application to financial derivatives pricing,"We consider the training of neural networks in cases where the nonlinear relationship of interest gradually changes over time. One possibility to deal with this problem is by regularization where a variation penalty is added to the usual mean squared error criterion. To learn the regularized network weights we suggest the Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) as a learning rule, which may be derived from a Bayesian perspective on the regularization problem. A primary application of our algorithm is in financial derivatives pricing, where neural networks may be used to model the dependency of the derivatives' price on one or several underlying assets. After giving a brief introduction to the problem of derivatives pricing we present experiments with German stock index options data showing that a regularized neural network trained with the IEKF outperforms several benchmark models and alternative learning procedures. In particular, the performance may be greatly improved using a newly designed neural network architecture that accounts for no-arbitrage pricing restrictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Pricing derivatives with modeling CO2 emission allowance using a regime-switching jump diffusion model: with regime-switching risk premium,"Carbon markets trade the spot European Union Allowance (EUA), with one EUA providing the right to emit one tone of carbon dioxide (CO2). We examine the spot EUA returns in BlueNext that exhibit jumps and a volatility clustering feature. We propose a regime-switching jump diffusion model (RSJM) with a hidden Markov chain to capture not only a volatility clustering feature, but also the dynamics of the spot EUA returns that are influenced by change in the CO2 emission economic conditions. In addition, the switching jump intensities of the RSJM are shown to be affected by change in the carbon-market macroeconomic environment. We further derive the theoretical futures-option prices with a constant convenience yield under the RSJM via the generalized Esscher transform where regime-switching risk is priced with a risk premium. The empirical study shows that the derived futures-option pricing model under the RSJM with regime-switching risk is a more complete model than a jump diffusion model for pricing CO2 options.",2016
Option pricing using Machine Learning,"This paper examines the option pricing performance of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms. The classic parametrical models suffer from several limitations in term of computational power required for parametric calibration and unrealistic economical and statistical assumptions. Therefore, a data driven approach based on non-parametric models is are well justified. Most of the previous researchers focus especially on the neural networks method (NN), the other algorithms being unexplored. Beside NN, this paper also analyses the performance of the Support Vector Regressions and Genetic Algorithms and propose three other Decision Tree methods, respectively Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGMB. In order to emphasize the power of this algorithms, a comparison with classical methods like Black-Scholes and Corrado-Su with both historical and implied parameters have been conducted. The analyzes were performed on European call options who have as underlying asset the WTI crude oil future contracts. Machine Learning algorithms outperform by a great margin the classical approaches regardless of the moneyness and the maturity of the contracts.",2021
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON CARBON PRICE PREDICTION USING STACKING ENSEMBLE MACHINE LEARNING,"Carbon pricing is an essential instrument for reducing climate change and has substantial environmental protection as a co-benefit. This paper proposes a technique for predicting the price of carbon emission futures based on a stacking ensemble machine learning approach. This method incorporates the historical prices of carbon, fossil energy, and renewable energies, all of which influence carbon price fluctuations. Notably, there are no existing studies that employ renewable energy data and stacking ensemble models to forecast the futures price of European Union Allowances (EUA). By integrating diverse data sources and leveraging the powerof ensemble learning, this research aims to fill that gap. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the stacking support vector regression model outperforms traditional machine learning models and earlier single-factor approaches in predicting future carbon prices. This superior performance is attributed to the model's ability to capture complex interactions among various influencing factors, thus providing more accurate and robustpredictions. Overall, using the stacking learning model for pricing carbon has significant implications. It can lead to more informed policy decisions, better management of carbon markets, and more effective strategies for mitigating the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. By accurately forecasting carbon prices, stakeholders can enhance their planning and investment decisions, ultimately contributing to the reduction of pollution emissions and the advancement of sustainable energy practices. This approach represents a significant step forward in the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques for environmental and economic sustainability.",2024
Numerical solving of the generalized Black-Scholes differential equation using Laguerre neural network,"Reasonable pricing of options in the financial derivatives market is crucial. For American options, or when volatility and interest rate are not constant, it is often difficult to obtain analytical solutions to the Black-Scholes (BS) equation. In this paper, the Laguerre neural network was proposed as a novel numerical algorithm with three layers of neurons for solving BS equations. The validity period and stock price are the input of the network, and the option price is the only output layer. Laguerre functions are used as the activation function of the neuron in the hidden layer. The BS equation and boundary conditions are set as penalty function, the training points are uniformly selected in the domain, and the improved extreme learning machine algorithm is used to optimize the network connection weights. Three experiments calculated the numerical solutions of BS equations for European options and generalized option pricing models. Compared with existing algorithms such as the finite element method and radial basis function neural network, the numerical solutions obtained by Laguerre neural network have higher accuracy and smaller errors, which illustrates the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method for solving BS equations.

Option pricing with neural networks vs. Black-Scholes under different volatility forecasting approaches for BIST 30 index options,"This study compares the performances of neural network and Black-Scholes models in pricing BIST30 (Borsa Istanbul) index call and put options with different volatility forecasting approaches. Since the volatility is the key parameter in pricing options, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), implied volatility, historical volatility, and implied volatility index (VBI) are used to determine the best volatility approach for pricing options according to moneyness and time-to-maturity dimensions. The paper also includes a subsample analysis in which the pricing performance of the models are evaluated during the turbulent periods. Overall results indicate that neural network outperforms Black-Scholes during tranquil times while Black-Scholes outperforms neural network during turbulent periods for call options. For put options, the Black-Scholes model is the best model during tranquil periods while neural network is the best model during turbulent periods.

Dynamic Implied Correlation Modeling and Forecasting in Structured Finance,"Correlations are the main drivers for credit portfolio risk and constitute a major element in pricing credit derivatives such as synthetic single-tranche collateralized debt obligation swaps. This study suggests a dynamic panel regression approach to model and forecast implied correlations. Random effects are introduced to account for unobservable time-specific effects on implied tranche correlations. The implied-correlation forecasts of tranche spreads are compared to forecasts using historical correlations from asset returns. The empirical findings support our proposed dynamic mixed-effects regression correlation model. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013
Dual-Hybrid Modeling for Option Pricing of CSI 300ETF,"The reasonable pricing of options can effectively help investors avoid risks and obtain benefits, which plays a very important role in the stability of the financial market. The traditional single option pricing model often fails to meet the ideal expectations due to its limited conditions. Combining an economic model with a deep learning model to establish a hybrid model provides a new method to improve the prediction accuracy of the pricing model. This includes the usage of real historical data of about 10,000 sets of CSI 300 ETF options from January to December 2020 for experimental analysis. Aiming at the prediction problem of CSI 300ETF option pricing, based on the importance of random forest features, the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory model (CNN-LSTM) in deep learning is combined with a typical stochastic volatility Heston model and stochastic interests CIR model in parameter models. The dual hybrid pricing model of the call option and the put option of CSI 300ETF is established. The dual-hybrid model and the reference model are integrated with ridge regression to further improve the forecasting effect. The results show that the dual-hybrid pricing model proposed in this paper has high accuracy, and the prediction accuracy is tens to hundreds of times higher than the reference model; moreover, MSE can be as low as 0.0003. The article provides an alternative method for the pricing of financial derivatives.",2022
"Machine learning for quantitative finance: fast derivative pricing, hedging and fitting","In this paper, we show how we can deploy machine learning techniques in the context of traditional quant problems. We illustrate that for many classical problems, we can arrive at speed-ups of several orders of magnitude by deploying machine learning techniques based on Gaussian process regression. The price we have to pay for this extra speed is some loss of accuracy. However, we show that this reduced accuracy is often well within reasonable limits and hence very acceptable from a practical point of view. The concrete examples concern fitting and estimation. In the fitting context, we fit sophisticated Greek profiles and summarize implied volatility surfaces. In the estimation context, we reduce computation times for the calculation of vanilla option values under advanced models, the pricing of American options and the pricing of exotic options under models beyond the Black-Scholes setting.",2018
Pricing variance swaps under the Hawkes jump-diffusion process,"This paper presents an analytical approach for pricing variance swaps with discrete sampling times when the underlying asset follows a Hawkes jump-diffusion process characterized with both stochastic volatility and clustered jumps. A significantly simplified method, with which there is no need to solve partial differential equations, is used to derive a closed-form pricing formula. A distinguished feature is that many recently published formulas can be shown to be special cases of the one presented here. Some numerical examples are provided with results demonstrating that jump clustering indeed has a significant impact on the price of variance swaps.",2019
Real-Time Pricing and Hedging of Options on Currency Futures with Artificial Neural Networks,"High-frequency trading and automated algorithm impose high requirements on computational methods. We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2014
Pricing dericative securities in incomplete markets,We propose the algorithms for pricing American and European options in incomplete markets. We consider a non-self-financing replicating portfolio and minimize the hedging error consisting of the self-financing error of the portfolio dynamics and the error of the option's payoff replication. We treat the pricing problem as regression with constraints and reduce it to a quadratic minimization problem. The algorithms of pricing American and European options differ in imposing one additional type of constraints. Prices of options for different initial and strike prices can be found in one optimization run. The algorithms create a table representing the option price as a function of time and the underlying stock price for the whole lifetime of the option. We illustrate the numerical performance of the algorithms with options on futures contracts in natural gas market.,2004
Accelerated American option pricing with deep neural networks,"Given the competitiveness of a market-making environment, the ability to speedily quote option prices consistent with an ever-changing market environment is essential. Thus, the smallest acceleration or improvement over traditional pricing methods is crucial to avoid arbitrage. We propose a method for accelerating the pricing of American options to near-instantaneous using a feed-forward neural network. This neural network is trained over the chosen (e.g., Heston) stochastic volatility specification. Such an approach facilitates parameter interpretability, as generally required by the regulators, and establishes our method in the area of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for finance. We show that the proposed deep explainable pricer induces a speed-accuracy trade-off compared to the typical Monte Carlo or Partial Differential Equation-based pricing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for pricing derivatives with path-dependent and more complex payoffs and is, given the sufficient accuracy of computation and its tractable nature, applicable in a market-making environment.",2023
Forecasting Chinese Stock Markets Volatility Based on Neural Network Combining,"Volatility plays a key role in asset and portfolio management and derivatives pricing. As such, more accurate measures and better forecasts of volatility are crucial for the implementation and evaluation of asset and derivative pricing models in addition to trading and hedging strategies. However, whilst GARCH models are able to capture the observed clustering effect in asset price volatility, they appear to provide relatively poor out-of-sample forecasts. In order to improve volatility forecasts, we put forward three combining volatility forecasting methods through simple averaging, an ordinary least squares model and an artificial neural network using daily closing data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index. The empirical study reveals that combining volatility forecasting methods have better forecast performance, and the non-linear method simulated by neural network are especially superior.",2008
The Role of a Changing Market Environment for Credit Default Swap Pricing,"This paper investigates the impact of a changing market environment on the pricing of credit default swaps (CDS) spreads written on debt from EURO STOXX 50 firms. A panel smooth transition regression reveals that parameter estimates of standard CDS-pricing variables are time varyingdepending on current values of a set of variables such as the European Central Bank's systemic stress composite index, the Sentix index for the current and future economic situation and the VStoxx. These variables describe the market's transition between different regimes, thereby reflecting the impact of substantial swings in agents' risk perception on CDS spreads. Overall, our results confirm the importance of nonlinearities in the pricing of risk derivatives during tranquil and turbulent times. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2016
Practical Bayesian support vector regression for financial time series prediction and market condition change detection,"Support vector regression (SVR) has long been proven to be a successful tool to predict financial time series. The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter mu to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.",2017
Analysis of parametric and non-parametric option pricing models,"In this paper, a closed-form analytical solution of option price under the Bi-Heston model is derived. Through empirical analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of the parametric pricing model are compared and analysed with those of the non-parametric model. The analysis shows that: (1) the parametric pricing model significantly outperforms the machine learning model in terms of in-sample pricing effects, while the Bi-Heston model slightly outperforms the Heston model. (2) In terms of out-of-sample pricing, the machine learning model is inferior to the parametric model for call options, while the Bi-Heston model is significantly better than the other two models for put options, and the other two models are similar. (3) In the robustness analysis of the three pricing models, the machine learning model shows strong instability, while the Bi-Heston model shows a more stable side.",2022
The analytic pricing of asymmetric defaultable swaps,Swaps where both parties are exposed to credit risk still lack convincing pricing mechanisms. This article presents a reduced-form model where the event of default is related to structural characteristics of each party. The cash flows submitted to credit risk are identified before the swap is priced. Analytical pricing formulas for interest rate and currency swaps are computed using a Gaussian model for risky bonds. Currency swaps exhibit additional correlation risk. The benefits from netting depend on the balance between exposures and market conditions in valuation. We show that sources of credit risk asymmetries are also likely to impact on credit spreads. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classification: G13; G15; G33.,2001
A comparison of wavelet networks and genetic programming in the context of temperature derivatives,"The purpose of this study is to develop a model that describes the dynamics of the daily average temperature accurately in the context of weather derivatives pricing. More precisely, we compare two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely wavelet networks and genetic programming, with the classic linear approaches that are used widely in the pricing of temperature derivatives in the financial weather market, as well as with various machine learning benchmark models such as neural networks, radial basis functions and support vector regression. The accuracy of the valuation process depends on the accuracy of the temperature forecasts. Our proposed models are evaluated and compared, both in-sample and out-of-sample, in various locations where weather derivatives are traded. Furthermore, we expand our analysis by examining the stability of the forecasting models relative to the forecasting horizon. Our findings suggest that the proposed nonlinear methods outperform the alternative linear models significantly, with wavelet networks ranking first, and that they can be used for accurate weather derivative pricing in the weather market.

Joint calibration of VIX and VXX options: does volatility clustering matter?,"This paper studies the effects of volatility clustering on the joint calibration of VIX and VXX options. We find that model which incorporates volatility clustering outperforms other models without this feature in joint calibration of VIX and VXX options both in-sample and out-of-sample; the superiority of the model with volatility clustering is statistically significant. Moreover, the information contained in the VXX options is not fully spanned by the VIX options, as a result, one can achieve better joint pricing performance by employing both VIX and VXX derivatives data when calibrating the model, compared to the case when only VIX data are used in calibration.",2023
Research on Temperature Forecasts Based on Wavelet Neural Network,"Research on pricing of weather derivatives is of great importance for enhancing agricultural and industrial safety. Temperature index is viewed as the core of the pricing of weather derivatives. This paper is prepared mainly with reference to the inherent characteristics that may be found in the temperature signals. The Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) is characterized by a combination of wavelet multi-resolution analysis with neural network nonlinear approximation. By application of the temperature data of Chongqing in the period from 1951 to 2010, the wavelet neural network model was used for temperature prediction and estimates. The empirical results of simulation and verification showed that the wavelet neural network established in this paper was capable of performing better prediction of future temperatures, and thus could be applied to areas such as pricing of weather derivatives.

USING MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT REALIZED VARIANCE,"Volatility index is a portfolio of options and represents market expectation of the underlying security's future realized volatility/variance. Traditionally the index weighting is based on a variance swap pricing formula. In this paper we propose a new method for building volatility index by formulating a variance prediction problem using machine learning. We test algorithms including Ridge regression, Feedforward Neural Networks and Random Forest on S&P 500 Index option data. By conducting a time series validation we show that the new weighting method can achieve higher predictability to future return variance and require fewer options. It is also shown that the weighting method combining the traditional and the machine learning approaches performs the best.",2020
Hedging derivative securities based on the neural network coefficient model,"Investment in options has attracted much interest among investors for both speculative and hedging reasons in financial markets at present. Applying neural networks to forecast volatility in option pricing has increased in popularity in recent years since many studies have indicated that the conventional option pricing models are not sufficiently accurate. This article proposes a neural network coefficient (NNC) model to re-price option values to improve on the tracking error in the measurement of hedging capability. The NNC model uses the variables introduced by the Black-Scholes (BS) Model and applies the linear regression (LR) model to price option values. It is worth noting that each corresponding weight coefficient in LR is constructed by a complete neural network rather than by a scalar value. By capturing the nonlinear behaviors of option pricing, our proposed NNC model has lower tracking error and better hedging capability than the BS model. Besides, the experimental data are obtained from the Taiwan Stock Index Commodity (TIMEX) index options instead of artificially simulated data in order to avoid departing from reality.",2005
Neural Network Pricing of American Put Options,"In this study, we use Neural Networks (NNs) to price American put options. We propose two NN models-a simple one and a more complex one-and we discuss the performance of two NN models with the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method. This study relies on American put option market prices, for four large U.S. companies-Procter and Gamble Company (PG), Coca-Cola Company (KO), General Motors (GM), and Bank of America Corp (BAC). Our dataset is composed of all options traded within the period December 2018 until March 2019. Although on average, both NN models perform better than LSM, the simpler model (NN Model 1) performs quite close to LSM. Moreover, the second NN model substantially outperforms the other models, having an RMSE ca. 40% lower than the presented by LSM. The lower RMSE is consistent across all companies, strike levels, and maturities. In summary, all methods present a good accuracy; however, after calibration, NNs produce better results in terms of both execution time and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",2020
Pricing options with exponential Levy neural network,"In this paper, we propose the exponential Levy neural network (ELNN) for option pricing, which is a new non-parametric exponential Levy model using artificial neural networks (ANN). The ELNN fully integrates the ANNs with the exponential Levy model, a conventional pricing model. So, the ELNN can improve ANN-based models to avoid several essential issues such as unacceptable outcomes and inconsistent pricing of over-the-counter products. Moreover, the ELNN is the first applicable non-parametric exponential Levy model by virtue of outstanding researches on optimization in the field of ANN. The existing non-parametric models are rather not robust for application in practice. The empirical tests with S&P 500 option prices show that the ELNN fits the data better than two parametric exp-Levy models and its estimates are less overfit than another network-based model.

Deep Equal Risk Pricing of Financial Derivatives with Non-Translation Invariant Risk Measures,"The objective is to study the use of non-translation invariant risk measures within the equal risk pricing (ERP) methodology for the valuation of financial derivatives. The ability to move beyond the class of convex risk measures considered in several prior studies provides more flexibility within the pricing scheme. In particular, suitable choices for the risk measure embedded in the ERP framework, such as the semi-mean-square-error (SMSE), are shown herein to alleviate the price inflation phenomenon observed under the tail value at risk-based ERP as documented in previous work. The numerical implementation of non-translation invariant ERP is performed through deep reinforcement learning, where a slight modification is applied to the conventional deep hedging training algorithm so as to enable obtaining a price through a single training run for the two neural networks associated with the respective long and short hedging strategies. The accuracy of the neural network training procedure is shown in simulation experiments not to be materially impacted by such modification of the training algorithm.",2023
Equal risk pricing of derivatives with deep hedging,"This article provides a universal and tractable methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to implement the equal risk pricing framework for financial derivatives pricing under very general conditions. The equal risk pricing framework entails solving for a derivative price which equates the optimally hedged residual risk exposure associated, respectively, with the long and short positions in the contingent claim. The solution to the hedging optimization problem considered, which is inspired from the [Marzban, S., Delage, E. and Li, J.Y., Equal risk pricing and hedging of financial derivatives with convex risk measures. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.02876, 2020.] framework relying on convex risk measures, is obtained through the use of the deep hedging algorithm of [Buehler, H., Gonon, L., Teichmann, J. and Wood, B., Deep hedging.Q. Finance, 2019,19, 1271-1291]. Consequently, the current paper's approach allows for the pricing and the hedging of a very large number of contingent claims (e.g. vanilla options, exotic options, options with multiple underlying assets) with multiple liquid hedging instruments under a wide variety of market dynamics (e.g. regime-switching, stochastic volatility, jumps). A novel epsilon-completeness measure allowing for the quantification of the residual hedging risk associated with a derivative is also proposed. The latter measure generalizes the one presented in [Bertsimas, D., Kogan, L. and Lo, A.W., Hedging derivative securities and incomplete markets: an epsilon-arbitrage approach.Oper. Res., 2001,49, 372-397.] based on the quadratic penalty. Monte Carlo simulations are performed under a large variety of market dynamics to demonstrate the practicability of our approach, to perform benchmarking with respect to traditional methods and to conduct sensitivity analyses. Numerical results show, among others, that equal risk prices of out-of-the-money options are significantly higher than risk-neutral prices stemming from conventional changes of measure across all dynamics considered. This finding is shown to be shared by different option categories which include vanilla and exotic options.",2021
A probabilistic approach for the valuation of variance swaps under stochastic volatility with jump clustering and regime switching,"The effects of stochastic volatility, jump clustering, and regime switching are considered when pricing variance swaps. This study established a two-stage procedure that simplifies the derivation by first isolating the regime switching from other stochastic sources. Based on this, a novel probabilistic approach was employed, leading to pricing formulas with time-dependent and regime-switching parameters. The formulated solutions were easy to implement and differed from most existing results of variance swap pricing, where Fourier inversion or fast Fourier transform must be performed to obtain the final results, since they are completely analytical without involving integrations. The numerical results indicate that jump clustering and regime switching have a significant influence on variance swap prices.",2024
Improved option pricing using artificial neural networks and bootstrap methods,"A hybrid neural network is used to predict the difference between the conventional option-pricing model and observed intraday option prices for stock index option futures. Confidence intervals derived with bootstrap methods are used in a trading strategy that only allows trades outside the estimated range of spurious model fits to be executed. Whilst hybrid neural network option pricing models can improve predictions they have bias. The hybrid option-pricing bias can be reduced with bootstrap methods. A modified bootstrap predictor is indexed by a parameter that allows the predictor to range from a pure bootstrap predictor, to a hybrid predictor, and finally the bagging predictor. The modified bootstrap predictor outperforms the hybrid and bagging predictors. Greatly improved performance was observed on the boundary of the training set and where only sparse training data exists. Finally, bootstrap bias estimates were studied.",1997
Pricing financial derivatives with neural networks,"Neural network algorithms are applied to the problem of option pricing and adopted to simulate the nonlinear behavior of such financial derivatives. Two different kinds of neural networks, i.e. multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis functions, are used and their performances compared in detail. The analysis is carried out both for standard European options and American ones, including evaluation of the Greek letters, necessary for hedging purposes. Detailed numerical investigation show that, after a careful phase of training, neural networks are able to predict the value of options and Greek letters with high accuracy and competitive computational time.

Howard's algorithm for high-order approximations of American options under jump-diffusion models,"Data-driven approaches to price computations of financial options are gaining in importance relative to methods based on numerical solutions of the pricing equations. Comparisons between artificial neural networks and the Black-Scholes pricing model have shown that the machine learning technique compares well in terms of performance with the parametric model. A Bayesian neural network model has recently been employed for predicting the price of options under jump-diffusion models since jump processes have a better capability of fitting market options data. The potential applicability of data-driven models for generating price approximations under jump processes is high, but due to the need of ensuring that computed prices are arbitrage-free, validation by the often employed partial differential equations approach is important. This work proposes a new algorithm that can be used for comparing prices obtained by a learning algorithm for diffusion models with jumps. Two directions are chosen in order to develop a competitive algorithm. The first is employing a higher-order discretisation of the pricing partial integro-differential equation and second using a more efficient numerical procedure for the solution of the resulting linear complementarity problem. Howard's algorithm or policy iteration is one such procedure for the second phase, but application of this method requires that the coefficient matrix is monotone. The combination of high-order approximations for the derivative and integral terms with policy iteration yields an accurate and efficient computational technique, and these properties are illustrated using an extensive set of numerical examples.",2020
A Physics informed neural network approach for solving time fractional Black-Scholes partial differential equations,"We present a novel approach for solving time fractional Black-Scholes partial differential equations (tfBSPDEs) using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach. Traditional numerical methods are faced with challenges in solving fractional PDEs due to the non-locality and non-differentiability nature of fractional derivative operators. By leveraging the ideas of Riemann sums and the refinement of tagged partitions of the time domain, we show that fractional derivatives can directly be incorporated into the loss function when applying the PINN approach to solving tfBSPDEs. The approach allows for the simultaneous learning of the underlying process dynamics and the involved fractional derivative operator without a need for the use of numerical discretization of the fractional derivatives. Through some numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, the PINN approach is efficient, accurate and computationally inexpensive particularly when dealing with high frequency and noisy data. This work augments the understanding between advanced mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques, contributing to the body of knowlege on the advancement of accurate derivative pricing models.",2024
Evaluating growth options as sources of value for pharmaceutical research projects,"The financial value of research projects is difficult to assess because they are highly uncertain. Often, the result is either an overly conservative approach to strategic innovation, based on net present value analyses, or an overly aggressive approach based on optimistic qualitative portfolios. R&D project evaluation requires recognizing threats as well as opportunities from uncertain events, and incorporating flexibility in managerial action in response to them. Real options pricing analysis is a widely discussed tool for evaluating such managerial flexibility. The limitation of options pricing lies in its requirement for complete financial markets, in which a replicating asset can be found that reproduces (or, at least, is correlated with) the project's payoffs in all possible states of the world. However, the major risks of research projects are typically project specific and cannot be replicated in external markets. In this situation, a decision tree is a better tool to represent managerial options during execution of the project, and to evaluate its value. A decision tree is equivalent to options pricing for risks that can be priced in the financial markets (if trading of securities is explicitly included), and moreover, it can incorporate risks and flexibility that are not traded in financial markets. Using decision trees, we demonstrate a quantitative evaluation of compound growth options from research at BestPharma, a large international pharmaceutical company. A growth option is a future opportunity that may arise from a current R&D investment. The growth option may not be related to the primary purpose of the R&D project, or not even be directly foreseeable. Kester (1984) has argued that growth options may account for a large part of project value. BestPharma faced the problem of choosing among several strategic research initiatives. They developed a decision tree representation of the projects, which helped to provide transparency about project value and strategic options. Most importantly, carefully thinking through the tree helped to identify growth options, represented by additional branches in the tree, and to quantify that they represented major sources of value.",2001
Option Pricing With Modular Neural Networks,"This paper investigates a nonparametric modular neural network (MNN) model to price the S&P-500 European call options. The modules are based on time to maturity and moneyness of the options. The option price function of interest is homogeneous of degree one with respect to the underlying index price and the strike price. When compared to an array of parametric and nonparametric models, the MNN method consistently exerts superior out-of-sample pricing performance. We conclude that modularity improves the generalization properties of standard feedforward neural network option pricing models (with and without the homogeneity hint).",2009
Option Pricing Based on the Residual Neural Network,"We employ an innovative deep learning method to price options quickly and accurately. Specifically, we construct the Residual Neural Network model (ResNet) by two different basic residual blocks with three one-dimensional convolution layers and a shortcut. This model is a generalized option pricing method, and it can be used to approximate the option pricing formula without any assumptions. Besides, the model also can be easily extended to the deep ResNet model to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Comprehensive numerical experiments show that the deep ResNet model has excellent performance in the pricing of 50ETF options in the Chinese market, and the prediction accuracy of our model is higher than that of commonly used deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN) and fully convolutional networks (FCN).",2024
Credit default swap pricing with counterparty risk in a reduced form model with Hawkes process,"In this article, we investigate the pricing of credit default swaps (CDS) while taking into account counterparty risk. We adopt a reduced form model with a self-exciting Hawkes process that allows for clustering in the default intensity. By solving the partial differential equations, we derive semi-analytical formulas for the joint survival probability density and the first default probability density. To obtain the numerical solutions for CDS pricing, we use the Runge-Kutta numerical method. Through our numerical analysis, by comparing the CDS pricing under the Poisson process, we find that the CDS pricing model under the Hawkes process provides a more general and richer structure and better describes the default risk of contagion.",2025
Deterministic modelling of implied volatility in cryptocurrency options with underlying multiple resolution momentum indicator and non-linear machine learning regression algorithm,"Modeling implied volatility (IV) is important for option pricing, hedging, and risk management. Previous studies of deterministic implied volatility functions (DIVFs) propose two parameters, moneyness and time to maturity, to estimate implied volatility. Recent DIVF models have included factors such as a moving average ratio and relative bid-ask spread but fail to enhance modeling accuracy. The current study offers a generalized DIVF model by including a momentum indicator for the underlying asset using a relative strength index (RSI) covering multiple time resolutions as a factor, as momentum is often used by investors and speculators in their trading decisions, and in contrast to volatility, RSI can distinguish between bull and bear markets. To the best of our knowledge, prior studies have not included RSI as a predictive factor in modeling IV. Instead of using a simple linear regression as in previous studies, we use a machine learning regression algorithm, namely random forest, to model a nonlinear IV. Previous studies apply DVIF modeling to options on traditional financial assets, such as stock and foreign exchange markets. Here, we study options on the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which poses greater modeling challenges due to its extreme volatility and the fact that it is not as well studied as traditional financial assets. Recent Bitcoin option chain data were collected from a leading cryptocurrency option exchange over a four-month period for model development and validation. Our dataset includes short-maturity options with expiry in less than six days, as well as a full range of moneyness, both of which are often excluded in existing studies as prices for options with these characteristics are often highly volatile and pose challenges to model building. Our in-sample and out-sample results indicate that including our proposed momentum indicator significantly enhances the model's accuracy in pricing options. The nonlinear machine learning random forest algorithm also performed better than a simple linear regression. Compared to prevailing option pricing models that employ stochastic variables, our DIVF model does not include stochastic factors but exhibits reasonably good performance. It is also easy to compute due to the availability of real-time RSIs. Our findings indicate our enhanced DIVF model offers significant improvements and may be an excellent alternative to existing option pricing models that are primarily stochastic in nature.",2024
An R & D Project Dealing with Mechanical Bits and Pieces in Real Option Analysis,"The goal of this paper is to study the R&D project under incomplete information.

"Option pricing and profitability: A comprehensive examination of machine learning, Black-Scholes, and Monte Carlo method","Options pricing remains a critical aspect of finance, dominated by traditional models such as Black-Scholesand binomial tree. However, as market dynamics become more complex, numerical methods such as Monte Carlosimulation are accommodating uncertainty and offering promising alternatives. In this paper, we examine howeffective different options pricing methods, from traditional models to machine learning algorithms, are at pre-dicting KOSPI200 option prices and maximizing investment returns. Using a dataset of 2023, we compare theperformance of models over different time frames and highlight the strengths and limitations of each model.In particular, we find that machine learning models are not as good at predicting prices as traditional modelsbut are adept at identifying undervalued options and producing significant returns. Our findings challenge exist-ing assumptions about the relationship between forecast accuracy and investment profitability and highlight thepotential of advanced methods in exploring dynamic financial environments.",2024
SF-Transformer: A Mutual Information-Enhanced Transformer Model with Spot-Forward Parity for Forecasting Long-Term Chinese Stock Index Futures Prices,"The complexity in stock index futures markets, influenced by the intricate interplay of human behavior, is characterized as nonlinearity and dynamism, contributing to significant uncertainty in long-term price forecasting. While machine learning models have demonstrated their efficacy in stock price forecasting, they rely solely on historical price data, which, given the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of financial markets, are insufficient to address the complexity and uncertainty in long-term forecasting due to the limited connection between historical and forecasting prices. This paper introduces a pioneering approach that integrates financial theory with advanced deep learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy and risk management in China's stock index futures market. The SF-Transformer model, combining spot-forward parity and the Transformer model, is proposed to improve forecasting accuracy across short and long-term horizons. Formulated upon the arbitrage-free futures pricing model, the spot-forward parity model offers variables such as stock index price, risk-free rate, and stock index dividend yield for forecasting. Our insight is that the mutual information generated by these variables has the potential to significantly reduce uncertainty in long-term forecasting. A case study on predicting major stock index futures prices in China demonstrates the superiority of the SF-Transformer model over models based on LSTM, MLP, and the stock index futures arbitrage-free pricing model, covering both short and long-term forecasting up to 28 days. Unlike existing machine learning models, the Transformer processes entire time series concurrently, leveraging its attention mechanism to discern intricate dependencies and capture long-range relationships, thereby offering a holistic understanding of time series data. An enhancement of mutual information is observed after introducing spot-forward parity in the forecasting. The variation of mutual information and ablation study results highlights the significant contributions of spot-forward parity, particularly to the long-term forecasting. Overall, these findings highlight the SF-Transformer model's efficacy in leveraging spot-forward parity for reducing uncertainty and advancing robust and comprehensive approaches in long-term stock index futures price forecasting.",2024
Predicting option prices: From the Black-Scholes model to machine learning methods,"In the ever-changing landscape of financial markets, accurate option pricing remains critical for investors, traders and financial institutions. Traditionally, the Black-Scholes (B&S) model has been the cornerstone for option pricing, providing a solid framework based on mathematical and physical principles. Nevertheless, the B&S model has some limitations, such as the restriction to European options, the absence of dividends, constant volatility, etc. Studies and academic literature on the application of machine learning models in the financial sector are rapidly increasing. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis between the traditional B&S model and the most commonly used machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The rationale is twofold. First, to examine the assumptions of the B&S model, such as constant volatility and a perfectly efficient market, in light of the complexity of the real world, even though it is recognized that the model has been known as a pillar for decades. Secondly, to emphasize that the proliferation of big data and advances in computing power have fuelled the rise of machine learning techniques in finance. These algorithms have remarkable capabilities in discovering non-linear patterns and extracting information from large data sets, providing a compelling alternative to traditional quantitative methods. Machine learning offers a new way to capture and model such complex financial dynamics, which can lead to more accurate pricing models. By comparing the B&S model and some machine learning approaches, this paper aims to shed light on their respective strengths, weaknesses and applicability in the context of options pricing using real data. Through rigorous empirical analyses and performance metrics, our results demonstrate the importance of using machine learning techniques that can outperform or complement the established B&S model in predicting option prices by achieving higher prediction accuracy.",2025
Price Behavior of Stock Index Futures: Evidence from the FTSE Xinhua China A50 and H-Share Index Futures Markets,"This study presents empirical evidence related to futures pricing for the SGX FTSE Xinhua China A50 and HKEx H-share index futures markets. First, whether the cost-of-carry model can describe the relationship between index futures prices and underlying stock indexes is examined. As anticipated, the cost of carry model cannot accurately predict the prices of these two index futures, because the two underlying Chinese stock markets display high price volatility. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that different risk-free interest rate proxies have little effect on the mispricing of the cost-of-carry model. Next, this study compares the pricing performance of the cost-of-carry model and the Hemler-Longstaff (1991) model with stock market volatility. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating stock market volatility into pricing models appears beneficial for estimating prices on these two index futures. Furthermore, the component GARCH model improves the pricing performance of the Hemler-Longstaff model. Finally, the autocorrelation and regression results suggest high persistence in mispricings.",2011
Empirical of the Taiwan stock index option price forecasting model - applied artificial neural network,"This work presents a novel neural network model for forecasting option prices using past volatilities and other options market factors.

The ability to develop accurate forecasts of grey prediction volatility enables practitioners to establish an appropriate hedging strategy at in-the-money option.",2009
A hybrid modeling approach for option pricing,"The complexity of option pricing has led many researchers to develop sophisticated models for such purposes. The commonly used Black-Scholes model suffers from a number of limitations. One of these limitations is the assumption that the underlying probability distribution is lognormal and this is so controversial. We propose a couple of hybrid models to reduce these limitations and enhance the ability of option pricing. The key input to option pricing model is volatility. In this paper, we use three popular GARCH type model for estimating volatility. Then, we develop two non-parametric models based on neural networks and neuro-fuzzy networks to price call options for S&P 500 index. We compare the results with those of Black-Scholes model and show that both neural network and neuro-fuzzy network models outperform Black-Scholes model. Furthermore, comparing the neural network and neuro-fuzzy approaches, we observe that for at-the-money options, neural network model performs better and for both in-the-money and an out-of-the money option, neuro-fuzzy model provides better results.",2011
Use of a principal components analysis for the generation of daily time series,"A new approach for generating daily time series is considered in response to the weather-derivatives market. This approach consists of performing a principal components analysis to create independent variables, the values of which are then generated separately with a random process. Weather derivatives are financial or insurance products that give companies the opportunity to cover themselves against adverse climate conditions. The aim of a generator is to provide a wider range of feasible situations to be used in an assessment of risk. Generation of a temperature time series is required by insurers or bankers for pricing weather options. The provision of conditional probabilities and a good representation of the interannual variance are the main challenges of a generator when used for weather derivatives. The generator was developed according to this new approach using a principal components analysis and was applied to the daily average temperature time series of the Paris-Montsouris station in France. The observed dataset was homogenized and the trend was removed to represent correctly the present climate. The results obtained with the generator show that it represents correctly the interannual variance of the observed climate; this is the main result of the work, because one of the main discrepancies of other generators is their inability to represent accurately the observed interannual climate variance-this discrepancy is not acceptable for an application to weather derivatives. The generator was also tested to calculate conditional probabilities: for example, the knowledge of the aggregated value of heating degree-days in the middle of the heating season allows one to estimate the probability if reaching a threshold at the end of the heating season. This represents the main application of a climate generator for use with weather derivatives.",2004
HDD and CDD option pricing with market price of weather risk for Taiwan,"This study extends the long-term temperature model proposed by Alaton et al. (2002) by taking into account ARCH/GARCH effects to reflect the clustering of volatility in temperature. The fixed variance model and the ARCH model are estimated using Taiwan weather data from 1974 through 2003. The results show that for HDD/CDD the call price is higher under ARCH-effects variance than under fixed variance, while the put price is lower. Although different pricing methods are employed in pricing weather options, the effects of mean and standard deviation on option prices are mathematically proved to be the same as those in pricing traditional financial derivatives using the Black-Scholes formula.

Multi-stage evaluation of R&D IT projects - Based on compound options,"Considering the characteristics of IT R&D, this paper introduced the concept of compound options into the evaluation of IT R&D investment, and proposed a compound options approach to evaluate multi-stage investment. This paper divided R&D project into three stages, including pre-experiment, large-scale research and commercialization. The options comprised in these three stages were viewed as compound options to be priced and evaluated. Referring to different features of these three stages, three approaches, i.e., binomial decision tree of single option, binomial decision tree of multi-stage options, and modified B-S model with a risk-averting investor, were set up to evaluate the values of these three stages respectively Moreover, a systematic pricing model which is easy to operate on practical evaluation of IT R&D investment options was discussed. Finally an example of the value evaluation for an IT R&D investment project was given to demonstrate the application.",2008
Calculations of fractional derivative option pricing models based on neural network,"The work adopts the neural network algorithm to derive optimized series solutions of fractional option pricing equations. The studied models include Caputo time-fractional equation and space-time fractional differential equations. The solutions of fractional derivative models are made up of the time variable and the kernel functions of RBF neural network. According to the characteristics of the models, the information function, the test solution, the output function and the loss function are established in turn. And then the optimal parameters of the solution structures of fractional derivative models are calculated by the designed neural network in conjunction with Chinese market data. For Caputo time-fractional model, the pricing results under different kernel functions, with or without cluster analysis, are compared through numerical analysis and illustration. The results of cluster analysis are better than those without cluster analysis. For spacetime fractional models, comparative studies between the pricing results under Caputo and conformable fractional derivatives and those from conformable fractional derivative are made and analyzed by the market data. The numerical simulations indicate that the space-time fractional derivative models have strong predictive abilities. Application analyses show that it is feasible and operable for fractional calculus tool and neural network algorithm to jointly act on the pricing problems of financial derivatives. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2024
A FINANCIAL OPTION PRICING MODEL BASED ON LEARNING ALGORITHMS,The Black-Scholes option pricing model provides theoretical values for the put and call options when do not pay dividends. In this work we compare these theoretical values with the obtained ones by a neural network that is applied to the option pricing market on the Ibex-35 index. Our result shows that the neural network is superior by the Black-Scholes model analyzing the kindness of the adjustment for the ME (mean of the option price errors) and RMSE (root mean square error).,2009
Derivatives of feed-forward neural networks and their application in real-time market risk management,"Market risk management of financial derivatives requires the efficient calculation of their price sensitivities with respect to changes in market factors. This paper shows how a deep feed-forward neural network which has been trained for pricing derivative instruments can be efficiently used to calculate these sensitivities as well. The proposed method is a fast and easily implementable alternative approach to automatic differentiation, and it simultaneously calculates all the first- and second-order derivatives of a multilayer feed-forward neural network with respect to its input features. The paper quantifies the performance improvement of the proposed method over a recent, publicly available implementation of automatic differentiation for a wide range of network sizes. The number of input parameters in these networks corresponds to those of commonly used financial models with stochastic volatility. The numerical accuracy of the proposed sensitivity calculations is demonstrated with a case study, calculating price sensitivities of European options under stochastic volatility. While the paper focuses on financial applications, the results presented herein are applicable to all deep feed-forward neural networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions.",2022
Fractional versus decimal pricing: Evidence from the UK Long Gilt futures market,"This paper analyses the impact of a move from fractional to decimal pricing in the UK Long Gilt futures; market, and thus offers a unique insight to tick size reduction and decimalization in a derivatives market setting. The reduced tick size leads to an increase in price clustering. The bid-ask spread, measured in ticks, increases following the tick size reduction. However, due to a reduced tick value, the monetary value of the spread declines. There is a substantial reduction in mean trade size as reduced-depth orders become trades. The mean daily number of transactions increases, which is entirely consistent with increased volume and decreased mean trade size. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2005
Option decision tree method of project evaluation under uncertainty environment,"Under uncertain environment, orthodox evaluation method such as NPV underestimates the value of project investment of company. Option decision tree (ODT), based on the characters of financial options, is used to make up for NPV shortages. Option decision tree method embedded real option thinking takes the value of uncertainty environment into account. Taking advantage of option decision tree, the paper has given respectively the real option value of the varied decisions by adopting different option pricing,formulations (B-S, McDonald and Siegel). This paper has given further discusses of the magnitude and the influence of uncertainty in making decision. Comparing the results of option decision tree evaluation with that of traditional methods, finally, this paper concludes that the option decision tree method considers the uncertainty value and chooses the maximum value of project according to the value of different contingent claims, and then make one invest more effectively and scientifically.",2004
A neural network versus Black-Scholes: A comparison of pricing and hedging performances,"The Black-Scholes formula is a well-known model for pricing and hedging derivative securities. It relies, however, on several highly questionable assumptions. This paper examines whether a neural network (MLP) can be used to find a call option pricing formula better corresponding to market prices and the properties of the underlying asset than the Black-Scholes formula' The neural network method is applied to the out-of-sample pricing and delta-hedging of daily Swedish stock index call options from 1997 to 1999. The relevance of a hedge-analysis is stressed further in this paper. As benchmarks, the Black-Scholes model with historical and implied volatility estimates are used. Comparisons reveal that the neural network models outperform the benchmarks both in pricing and hedging performances. A moving block bootstrap is used to test the statistical significance of the results. Although the neural networks are superior, the results are sometimes insignificant at the 5% level.

Artificial Neural Networks Performance in WIG20 Index Options Pricing,"In this paper, the performance of artificial neural networks in option pricing was analyzed and compared with the results obtained from the Black-Scholes-Merton model, based on the historical volatility. The results were compared based on various error metrics calculated separately between three moneyness ratios. The market data-driven approach was taken to train and test the neural network on the real-world options data from 2009 to 2019, quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The artificial neural network did not provide more accurate option prices, even though its hyperparameters were properly tuned. The Black-Scholes-Merton model turned out to be more precise and robust to various market conditions. In addition, the bias of the forecasts obtained from the neural network differed significantly between moneyness states. This study provides an initial insight into the application of deep learning methods to pricing options in emerging markets with low liquidity and high volatility.",2022
Neural network regression for Bermudan option pricing,"The pricing of Bermudan options amounts to solving a dynamic programming principle, in which the main difficulty, especially in high dimension, comes from the conditional expectation involved in the computation of the continuation value. These conditional expectations are classically computed by regression techniques on a finite-dimensional vector space. In this work, we study neural networks approximations of conditional expectations. We prove the convergence of the well-known Longstaff and Schwartz algorithm when the standard least-square regression is replaced by a neural network approximation, assuming an efficient algorithm to compute this approximation. We illustrate the numerical efficiency of neural networks as an alternative to standard regression methods for approximating conditional expectations on several numerical examples.",2021
A hybrid option pricing model using a neural network for estimating volatility,"The Black-Scholes (BS) model is the standard approach used for pricing financial options. However, although being theoretically strong, option prices valued by the model often differ from the prices observed in the financial markets. This paper applies a hybrid neural network which preprocesses financial input data for improving the estimation of option market prices. This model is comprised of two parts. The first part is a neural network developed to estimate volatility. The second part is an additional neural network developed to value the difference between the BS model results and the actual market option prices. The resulting option price is then a summation between the BS model and the network response. The hybrid system with a neural network for estimating volatility provides better performance in terms of pricing accuracy than either the BS model with historical volatility (HV), or the BS model with volatility valued by the neural network.",2007
Public support for carbon pricing policies and revenue recycling options: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the survey literature,"Since public support is critical for implementing carbon pricing policies, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the survey-based literature on change in public support for direct and indirect carbon pricing policies with and without revenue recycling options. Following a comprehensive and transparent machine-learning assisted screening of the literature, our dataset comprises 35 studies containing 70 surveys across 26 countries with over 100,000 respondents. We find that the introduction of any type of revenue recycling option increases public support for carbon pricing. Results from our meta-regression indicate that green spending (i.e. using revenues for climate-friendly projects) is the only revenue recycling option associated with a statistically significant increase in public support. Our findings moreover suggest that the effects may depend on which region the survey was carried out, highlighting the need for additional research in countries in the regions of Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.",2024
Pricing Vulnerable Options with Jump Clustering,"This paper presents a valuation of vulnerable European options using a model with self-exciting Hawkes processes that allow for clustered jumps rather than independent jumps. Many existing valuation models can be regarded as special cases of the model proposed here. Using numerical analyses, this study also performs sensitivity analyses and compares the results to those of existing models for European call options. The results show that jump clustering has a significant impact on the option value. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark",2017
Machine learning solutions to challenges in finance: An application to the pricing of financial products,"The recent fast development of machine learning provides new tools to solve challenges in many areas. In finance, average options are popular financial products among corporations, institutional investors, and individual investors for risk management and investment because average options have the advantages of cheap prices and their payoffs are not very sensitive to the changes of the underlying asset prices at the maturity date, avoiding the manipulation of asset prices and option prices. The challenge is that pricing arithmetic average options requires traditional numerical methods with the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and non-realistic model assumptions. This paper proposes a machine-learning method to price arithmetic and geometric average options accurately and in particular quickly. The method is model-free and it is verified by empirical applications as well as numerical experiments.",2020
Option pricing with deep learning: a long short-term memory approach,"This paper presents a deep learning approach for option pricing using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network applied to European call options on the S&P 500 index. We utilize a rolling window approach that trains 12 instances of the LSTM model, one for each month of 2021. To gain further insight into the model performance, we use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) through SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). We find that the LSTM model outperforms the Black-Scholes and the Heston models and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network regarding overall pricing accuracy. Most notably, the time-sequencing nature of LSTM enables the proposed model to capture sufficient short-term volatility from recently traded options. This result is still robust when controlling for time-varying volatility dynamics. Thus, the model is less prone to measurement errors in volatility.",2025
A new hybrid parametric and machine learning model with homogeneity hint for European-style index option pricing,"Here, we propose and investigate a hybrid model that combines parametric option pricing models such as Black-Scholes (BS) option pricing model, Monte Carlo option pricing model, and finite difference method with nonparametric machine learning techniques such as support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine-based regression models. The purpose of this model is to support better investment decisions by forecasting the option price with high predictive accuracy. To further reduce the forecasting error, we incorporate a homogeneity hint (i.e., training the model by categorizing the options data based on moneyness and time-to-maturity of the option contract) into the model. We examine the feasibility and effectiveness of this model using a case study to predict the one-day-ahead price of index options traded in the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. Our experimental results show that the proposed new hybrid model is viable and effective and provides better predictive performance as compared with our benchmark models (standard BS Model, standard Monte Carlo, standard finite difference model, and standard SVR Model). For example, the proposed hybrid model using SVR improved, respectively, the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error by 83.66 and 85.46 % (D1 dataset), 78.02 and 76.0 % (D2 dataset), 91.86 and 90.62 % (D3 dataset), and 87.7 and 90.29 % (D4 dataset), when compared with the benchmarked BS model. We observe similar improvements over the other benchmarked models. Therefore, the proposed new hybrid model is a suitable alternative model for option pricing when higher predictive accuracy is desired.",2017
Post-'87 crash fears in the S&P 500 futures option market,"Post-crash distributions inferred from S&P 500 future option prices have been strongly negatively skewed. This article examines two alternate explanations: stochastic volatility and jumps. The two option pricing models are nested, and are fitted to S&P 500 futures options data over 1988-1993. The stochastic volatility model requires extreme parameters (e.g., high volatility of volatility) that are implausible given the time series properties of option prices. The stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model fits option prices better, and generates more plausible volatility process parameters. However, its implicit distributions are inconsistent with the absence of large stock index moves over 1988-93. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved. JEL classification: G13.",2000
Multi-perspective option price forecasting combining parametric and non-parametric pricing models with a new dynamic ensemble framework,"This article introduces a dynamic ensemble framework that integrates parametric and non-parametric pricing models. Within this framework, we propose a time-varying parametric pricing model optimized using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, we construct a non-parametric pricing model using a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to capture the interactions among options, enhancing the existing nonparametric pricing model. Validation using China's SSE 50 ETF options trading data reveals several key findings: Firstly, the dynamic integration method proposed in this study not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances stability. Secondly, previous parametric pricing models do not effectively utilize their pricing performance, while our proposed time-varying parametric pricing model significantly enhances accuracy. Lastly, the 2D-CNN model, which considers interactions among options trades, proves to be reasonable and effective, outperforming common non-parametric pricing models. The dynamic ensemble framework proposed in this study effectively combines the strengths of both parametric and non-parametric pricing models. This research serves as an important reference for risk managers, institutional investors, and other stakeholders. Furthermore, it provides valuable research ideas for future scholars in the field.",2024
The Application of Symbolic Regression on Identifying Implied Volatility Surface,"One important parameter in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the implied volatility. Implied volatility surface (IVS) is an important concept in finance that describes the variation of implied volatility across option strike price and time to maturity. Over the last few decades, economists and financialists have long tried to exploit the predictability in the IVS using various parametric models, which require deep understanding of financial practices in the area. In this paper, we explore how a data-driven machine learning method, symbolic regression, performs in identifying the implied volatility surface even without deep financial knowledge. Two different approaches of symbolic regression are explored through a simulation study and an empirical study using a large panel of option data in the United States options market.",2023
Wavelet-based option pricing: An empirical study,"In this paper, we scrutinize the empirical performance of a wavelet-based option pricing model which leverages the powerful computational capability of wavelets in approximating risk-neutral moment-generating functions. We focus on the forecasting and hedging performance of the model in comparison with that of popular alternative models, including the stochastic volatility model with jumps, the practitioner Black-Scholes model and the neural network based model. Using daily index options written on the German DAX 30 index from January 2009 to December 2012, our results suggest that the wavelet-based model compares favorably with all other models except the neural network based one, especially for long-term options. Hence our novel wavelet-based option pricing model provides an excellent non parametric alternative for valuing option prices. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A hybrid neural network approach to the pricing of options,,1995
Option Pricing Models: From Black-Scholes-Merton to Present,"Its intuitiveness and the simplicity of its calculations make the seminal Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model the most commonly known and used among all asset pricing models ever developed. Almost half a century after it was introduced, a massive literature has been devoted, and is still being generated, to empirical testing of the original model, to developing new models addressing its original assumptions and biases, and to extending the framework of option pricing. This article presents a review of fundamental option pricing models from Black-Scholes-Merton to the present day, covering alternative option pricing approaches, including those for options on different underlying assets as well as those with different asset price and volatility dynamics. This article also reviews contemporary topics in options, including applications to novel risks such as climate-related risks and volatility risk, as well as implementation of novel methodologies from data science and machine learning.",2022
"The QLBS Q-Learner goes NuQLear: fitted Q iteration, inverse RL, and option portfolios","The QLBS model is a discrete-time option hedging and pricing model that is based on Dynamic Programming (DP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It combines the famous Q-Learning method for RL with the Black-Scholes (-Merton) (BSM) model's idea of reducing the problem of option pricing and hedging to the problem of optimal rebalancing of a dynamic replicating portfolio for the option, which is made of a stock and cash. Here we expand on several NuQLear (Numerical Q-Learning) topics with the QLBS model. First, we investigate the performance of Fitted Q Iteration for an RL (data-driven) solution to the model, and benchmark it versus a DP (model-based) solution, as well as versus the BSM model. Second, we develop an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) setting for the model, where we only observe prices and actions (re-hedges) taken by a trader, but not rewards. Third, we outline how the QLBS model can be used for pricing portfolios of options, rather than a single option in isolation, thus providing its own, data-driven and model-independent solution to the (in)famous volatility smile problem of the Black-Scholes model.",2019
Considering momentum spillover effects via graph neural network in option pricing,"Traditional options pricing relies on underlying asset volatility and contract properties. However, asset volatility is affected by the lead-lag effects, known as the momentum spillover effect. To address this, we propose a proxy measuring correlated options' influence based on maturity date. Findings indicate that 1-day-lagged proxy indicators positively impact option returns. Furthermore, to capture the dynamic effects of correlated options, we introduce a deep graph neural network-based model (GNN-MS). Empirical results on Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 exchange-traded fund options reveal GNN-MS significantly outperforms classics, enhancing root-mean-square error by at least 8.81%. This study provides novel insights into option pricing considering momentum spillover effects.",2024
Extensive networks would eliminate the demand for pricing formulas,"In this study, we generate a large number of implied volatilities for the Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho (SABR) model using a graphics processing unit (GPU) based simulation and enable an extensive neural network to learn the volatilities. This model does not have any exact pricing formulas for vanilla options, and neural networks have an outstanding ability to approximate various functions. Surprisingly, the network reduces the simulation noise by itself, thereby achieving accuracy equal to large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation. Extremely high accuracy cannot be attained via existing approximate formulas. Moreover, the network is as efficient as the approaches based on the formulas. When evaluating accuracy and efficiency, extensive networks can eliminate the necessity of pricing formulas for the SABR model. Another significant contribution is that a novel method is proposed to examine the errors based on nonlinear regression. This approach is easily extendable to other pricing models for which it is hard to deduce analytic formulas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2022
Evolutionary Hedging Model for Power Trading to Maximize Daily Profits,"Established trading strategies such as fully back-to-back hedging no longer work in a world where customers transfer the cost of hedging completely to traders. Dynamic daily hedging models, in which profits are generated from long and short futures' positions, have been proposed in combination with accurate Phelix futures and spot price forecasting. This study provides a new approach to accurately forecast Phelix monthly futures prices with long short-term memory-recurrent neural network time series. In addition, a newly proposed daily dynamic hedging model capable of processing recurring inputs is optimized with an evolutionary algorithm to maximize daily profits. Calculated optimized daily hedge ratios provided by the algorithm are backtested on real Phelix market data. The results for the different tested periods confirm that a trading company could consistently generate positive returns under the most competitive pricing assumption and outperform established trading strategies in both trending bear and bull markets.",2020
Improved BP Neural Network and Its Application in Real Option Pricing,"In recent years, many overseas and domestic experts had paid attention to research on options pricing. But these methods could not get rid of the subjectivity and fuzzy qualities existing in pricing process, and the accuracy of assessed results had not quite improved. It will be very helpful to investors, if we could set up an objective scientific real option pricing method. The paper researches on an improved BP artificial neural network model and its appliance in the investment decision-making.",2008
FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE VALUATION - A DYNAMIC SEMIPARAMETRIC APPROACH,"A dynamic semiparametric pricing method is proposed for financial derivatives, including European and American-type options and convertible bonds. The proposed method is an iterative procedure which uses nonparametric regression to approximate derivative values, and parametric asset models to derive the continuation values. Extension to higher-dimensional option pricing is also developed, in which the dependence structure of financial time series is modeled by copula functions. In the simulation study, we valuate one-dimensional American options, convertible bonds, multi-dimensional American geometric average options, and max options. The considered one-dimensional underlying asset models include the Black-Scholes, jump-diffusion, and NGARCH models and, for the multivariate case, we study copula models Such as the Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulae. Convergence of the method is proved tinder continuity assumption on the transition densities of the underlying asset models, and the orders of the supnorm errors are derived. Both the theoretical findings and the simulation results show the proposed approach to be tractable for numerical implementation and that it provides a unified and accurate technique for financial derivative pricing.",2009
Does bid-ask spread explains the smile? On DVF and DML,"In this paper, we investigate the potential effect of the bid-ask spread on pricing and implied volatilities of the newly established CSI 300 index options in China. We use the deterministic volatility function (DVF) to analyze the pricing errors and employ the double machine learning (DML) technique to evaluate the effect of liquidity costs on implied volatility in the presence of economic confounders. Our research shows that the deterministic volatility function modified to incorporate the bid-ask spread work better than the Black-Scholes model. And a sizable and statistically liquidity costs effect on implied volatility is observed in the CSI 300 options market.",2025
Spatial Risk Premium on Weather Derivatives and Hedging Weather Exposure in Electricity,"Due to the dependency of the energy demand on temperature, weather derivatives enable the effective hedging of temperature related fluctuations. However, temperature varies in space and time and therefore the contingent weather derivatives also vary. The spatial derivative price distribution involves a risk premium. We employ a pricing model for temperature derivatives based on dynamics modeled via a vectorial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with seasonal variation. We use an analytical expression for the risk premia depending on variation curves of temperature in the measurement period. The dependence is exploited by a functional principal component analysis of the curves. We compute risk premia on cumulative average temperature futures for locations traded on CME and fit to it a geographically weighted regression on functional principal component scores. It allows us to predict risk premia for nontraded locations and to adopt, on this basis, a hedging strategy, which we illustrate in the example of Leipzig.",2012
Advanced Option Pricing and Hedging with Q-Learning: Performance Evaluation of the QLBS Algorithm,"This article provides an overview of the recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for pricing and hedging financial instruments, focusing on the Q-Learning Black-Scholes (QLBS) approach. This RL approach bridges the traditional Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model with artificial intelligence algorithms, enabling option pricing and hedging in a completely model-free and data-driven way. The study evaluates the QLBS algorithm's performance across different state variables and scenarios for a European put option, showing that the model accurately estimates option prices under varying volatility levels, hedging frequencies, risk-free rates, and when dividends are included. Additionally, the QLBS method shows robust performance in pricing and hedging options across different moneyness levels, with more pronounced deviations from the BSM model for deep in-the-money options under higher risk aversion. The empirical analysis also incorporates proportional transaction costs using at-the-money S&P 500 call options, revealing varied implications for profitability and risk mitigation, influenced by the choice of state variables. The article sheds light on the QLBS model's explainability by providing detailed technical notes and a numerical example, and additionally, the results reveal its high practical relevance.",2025
Are futures prices good price forecasts? Underestimation of price reversion in the soybean complex,"Using quantile regression, we evaluate the forecasting performance of futures prices in the soybean complex. The procedure provides a more complete picture of the distribution of forecasts than mainstream methods that only focus on central tendency measures. Forecast performance differs by location in the futures price distribution. Futures forecast perform well in the centre of the distribution. However, futures prices tend to over-forecast when futures prices are high and under-forecast when futures prices are low, suggesting that futures prices tend to under-estimate price reversion towards the centre of the distribution. Forecast errors are larger when futures prices are high. The findings are related to theories in the literature used to explain pricing bias, and their implications for market participants are discussed.",2020
Efficient option pricing via a globally regularized neural network,"Nonparametric approaches of option pricing have recently emerged as alternative approaches that complement traditional parametric approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network learning algorithm for option-pricing, which is a nonparametric approach. The proposed method is devised to improve generalization and computing time. Experimental results are conducted for the KOSPI200 index daily call options and demonstrate a significant performance improvement to reduce test error compared to other existing techniques.",2004

On the Pricing Formula for the Perpetual American Volatility Option Under the Mean-reverting Processes,"This paper studies the properties of the parabolic free-boundary problem arising from pricing of American volatility options in mean-reverting volatility processes. When the volatility index follows the mean-reverting square root process (MRSRP), we derive a closed-form pricing formula for the perpetual American power volatility option. Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is extended to find an approximate solution of the free boundary problem arising from pricing the perpetual American option. The comparison results demonstrates that the ANN provides an accurate approach to approximate solution for the free boundary problem.",2021
The application of weather derivatives to mitigate the financial risk of climate variability and extreme weather events,"Evidence of the challenge faced by the meteorological community to become skilled in applying risk management products from the financial markets is growing. This paper presents an approach to the pricing of weather derivatives that employs a combination of empirical data including forecast verification data, regional synoptic classification data, and data associated with climate indices on a global scale, such as the Southern Oscillation Index. The paper presents several illustrative examples that show how to price these options about the occurrence of an unusual weather event, using forecast verification data and synoptic classification data.",2001
COVID-19 and commodity pricing premium: Evidence from the Chinese market,"Our paper studies the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on commodity pricing premiums in the Chinese commodity futures market. After summarizing the explanatory power of documented benchmark pricing factors, we apply the difference-in-difference regression for our event study. We document a substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on increasing the commodity basis premium by at least 30%. Basis-momentum premium, especially for agriculture futures, also increases during the epidemic. The results are robust and validated by sub-sample regressions. The influence of COVID-19 on the commodity market is more prevailing than the trade war.",2023
Approximation of single-barrier options partial differential equations using feed-forward neural network,"Artificial neural networks are generally employed in the numerical solution of differential equation problems. In this article, we propose an approach that deals with the combination of the feed-forward neural network method and the optimization technique in solving the partial differential equation arising from the valuation of barrier options. The methodology entails transforming the extended Black-Scholes partial differential equations (PDE), which defines a barrier option, into a constrained optimization problem, and then proposing a trial solution that reduces the differential equation problem to an unconstrained one. This trial function consists of the adjustable and non-adjustable neural network parameters. We design it to be differentiable, analytic, and satisfy the initial and boundary conditions of the corresponding option pricing PDE. We compare the corresponding option values to the Monte-Carlo simulated values, Crank-Nicolson finite-difference values and the exact Black-Scholes prices. Numerical results presented in this research show that neural networks can sufficiently solve PDE-related problems with sufficient precision and accuracy. Furthermore, they can be applied in the fast and accurate valuation of financial derivatives without closed analytic forms.",2022
World energy futures market efficiency and its determinants; evidence from white noise test based on block-wise wild bootstrap approach,"The study examines the time-varying efficiency of nine energy futures traded across different exchanges with varied trade settlement methods and pricing currency using the novel white noise test based on block-wsie wild bootstrap approach. The advantage of using this approach is that it relaxes the assumption of serial independence and the martingale difference sequence. Time-varying efficiency is observed for all nine energy futures consistent with the Adoptive Market Hypothesis (AMH). The three most (least) efficient energy futures based on efficiency ratio are Coal, Gasoline and NaturalGas (WTI, Brent and OmanCrude). Quantile regression analysis shows that the higher the level of illiquidity furthers the level of efficiency towards inefficiency (high level of efficiency) in the case of a less (more) efficient market. A mixed impact of volatility is observed across energy futures. No differential impact is found due to exchange, method of settlement and pricing currency. The robustness of the results is investigated, policy implications are discussed, and further research is recommended.",2024
Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network for Pricing Multi-Asset European Options,"This paper studies a p-layers deep learning artificial neural network (DLANN) for European multi-asset options. Firstly, a p-layers DLANN is constructed with undetermined weights and bias. Secondly, according to the terminal values of the partial differential equation (PDE) and the points that satisfy the PDE of multi-asset options, some discrete data are fed into the p-layers DLANN. Thirdly, using the least square error as the objective function, the weights and bias of the DLANN are trained well. In order to optimize the objective function, the partial derivatives for the weights and bias of DLANN are carefully derived. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, a time-segment DLANN is proposed. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed p-layers DLANN. Computational examples show that the DLANN's relative error is less than 0.5% for different numbers of assets d=1,2,3,4. In the future, the p-layers DLANN can be extended into American options, Asian options, Lookback options, and so on.",2025
QLBS: Q-Learner in the Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds,"This article presents a discretetime option pricing model that is rooted in reinforcement learning (RL), and more specifically in the famous Q-Learning method of RL. We construct a risk-adjusted Markov Decision Process for a discrete-time version of the classical Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, where the option price is an optimal Q-function, while the optimal hedge is a second argument of this optimal Q-function, so that both the price and hedge are parts of the same formula. Pricing is done by learning to dynamically optimize risk-adjusted returns for an option replicating portfolio, as in Markowitz portfolio theory. Using Q-Learning and related methods, once created in a parametric setting, the model can go model-free and learn to price and hedge an option directly from data, without an explicit model of the world. This suggests that RL may provide efficient data-driven and model-free methods for the optimal pricing and hedging of options. Once we depart from the academic continuous-time limit, and vice versa, option pricing methods developed in Mathematical Finance may be viewed as special cases of model-based reinforcement learning. Further, due to the simplicity and tractability of our model, which only needs basic linear algebra (plus Monte Carlo simulation, if we work with synthetic data), and its close relationship to the original BSM model, we suggest that our model could be used in the benchmarking of different RL algorithms for financial trading applications.",2020
Further Study on Futures Pricing based on Time Factor: Taking Copper in SHFE as an Example,"To disclose the relationship between futures price and spot prices, the paper starts with the basic pricing formula of futures contract to deduce a general econometric equation which directly includes the time factor. The paper also analyzes the implication of each parameter such as intercept, elasticity and convenience yield respectively marked as alpha, beta and gamma. Then based on data set since June 2001 we respectively make a regression for each year and the result demonstrates the trend characteristic of Copper pricing in SHFE is directly determined by the Copper trade's supply and demand pattern under the new world economic situation. In addition, the paper finds out the pricing law was very disordered in 2004 and explains this anomalous phenomenon from the perspective of State Reserve Bureau's market intervention in 2004.",2010
Does bitcoin liquidity resemble the liquidity of other financial assets?,"Bitcoin is becoming a popular financial asset and means of transacting. However, little is known about an important aspect of the bitcoin market: its liquidity. We consider whether various dimensions of liquidity evident in other asset classes are present in bitcoin spot and futures liquidity. We find variations in spot liquidity across bitcoin exchanges and a strong commonality in bitcoin spot and futures market liquidity. The pricing of spot and futures bitcoin is relatively inefficient, and liquidity plays an important role. Deterioration in liquidity also contributes to bitcoin crash risk and large return declines.

Enhancing Currency Option Pricing Models: Incorporating Dynamic Information Costs and Machine Learning Techniques,"The concept of information cost has evolved over time and has been applied to various decision problems, including currency option pricing. This research delves into the impact of dynamic information costs on the currency option pricing model, innovatively developed by Dammak et al. (J Econ Asymmetries 28:e00337, 2023a https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2023.e00337, Global Finance J, 2023b https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfj.2023.100897). We utilize the Differential Evolution algorithm to calibrate the novel information cost parameters, using data from various currency call options pairs from January 1, 2018, to November 24, 2022. A satisfactory approximation of real market currency option prices is achieved through this methodology. Additionally, we harness the power of machine learning to predict the values of effective domestic and foreign interest rates within a changing information cost landscape. By partitioning our dataset into training and test sets, our study demonstrates that the new model, incorporating dynamic information costs, generates more accurate and stable pricing outcomes. This research marks a substantive contribution to the evolving field of option pricing, emphasizing the potential of machine learning techniques in solving complex financial problems.",2025
Can a Machine Correct Option Pricing Models?,"We introduce a novel two-step approach to predict implied volatility surfaces. Given any fitted parametric option pricing model, we train a feedforward neural network on the model-implied pricing errors to correct for mispricing and boost performance. Using a large dataset of S&P 500 options, we test our nonparametric correction on several parametric models ranging from ad-hoc Black-Scholes to structural stochastic volatility models and demonstrate the boosted performance for each model. Out-of-sample prediction exercises in the cross-section and in the option panel show that machine-corrected models always outperform their respective original ones, often by a large extent. Our method is relatively indiscriminate, bringing pricing errors down to a similar magnitude regardless of the misspecification of the original parametric model. Even so, correcting models that are less misspecified usually leads to additional improvements in performance and also outperforms a neural network fitted directly to the implied volatility surface.",2023
"Forecasting volatilities in equity, bond and money markets: A market-based approach","This study examines the forecasting power of the most popular volatility forecasting models in the S&P 500 index market, the Eurodollar futures market, and the 30-year US T-Bond futures market at a daily level using a market-based option-pricing error approach. Comparison has been made between two methods including and excluding implied volatility in option-pricing error approach in forecasting next-day volatilities. To remove any advantage to option-implied volatility, the analysis is performed in two steps. Spurious regression biases and biases in the measurement of volatility forecasts are controlled for. The evidence from this paper supports the use of implied volatility as a proxy for market volatility, as it works best in forecasting next-day realized volatility in all the three US markets. The appropriateness of including implied volatility in option-pricing error approach is also discussed.",2010
A NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL FOR ESTIMATING OPTION PRICES,"A neural network model that processes financial input data is developed to estimate the market price of options at closing. The network's ability to estimate closing prices is compared to the Black-Scholes model, the most widely used model for the pricing of options. Comparisons reveal that the mean squared error for the neural network is less than that of the Black-Scholes model in about half of the cases examined. The differences and similarities in the two modeling approaches are discussed. The neural network, which uses the same financial data as the Black-Scholes model, requires no distribution assumptions and learns the relationships between the financial input data and the option price from the historical data. The option-valuation equilibrium model of Black-Scholes determines option prices under the assumptions that prices follow a continuous time path and that the instantaneous volatility is nonstochastic.",1993
Volatility estimation with a neural network,"The prediction of the volatility of financial time-series is very important for the evaluation and pricing of options and the development of option trading strategies. In this paper, a neural network for predicting the volatility of the German Bund future is presented. Its performance is compared to that of a nonlinear GARCH model.",1997
Pricing and calibration in the 4-factor path-dependent volatility model,"We consider the path-dependent volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023), where the instantaneous volatility is a linear combination of a weighted sum of past returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past squared returns. We discuss the influence of an additional parameter that unlocks enough volatility on the upside to reproduce the implied volatility smiles of S&P 500 and VIX options. This PDV model, motivated by empirical studies, comes with computational challenges, especially in relation to VIX options pricing and calibration. We propose an accurate pathwise neural network approximation of the VIX which leverages on the Markovianity of the 4-factor version of the model. The VIX is learned pathwise as a function of the Markovian factors and the model parameters. We use this approximation to tackle the joint calibration of S&P 500 and VIX options, quickly sample VIX paths, and price derivatives that jointly depend on S&P 500 and VIX. As an interesting aside, we also show that this time-homogeneous, low-parametric, Markovian PDV model is able to fit the whole surface of S&P 500 implied volatilities remarkably well.",2025
Pricing of Mixed Compound Real Options,"The composition and mutual relations among real options in the project life cycle are extremely complex, and the existing models of real options can't well describe the interrelated management flexibility. Therefore, this paper puts forward the new classification for compound real options, gives the concept of mixed compound real options, and studies the interactions among the constituents and their pricing. The research holds that the basic relations among real options are the string, OR, and AND, which are key to the pricing of different types of mixed compound real options, and the biggest pricing difference between mixed compound real options and a single real option is in their underlying assets. Finally, the pricing method is illustrated by a case.",2008
An Optimized Hybrid Model for Price Deviation Evaluation based on Neural Network,"As a strong displaying approach, neural networks have been broadly utilized in finance and financial forecasting. Scientific and fair trading-type open-end index fund (ETF) option pricing is favorable to maximizing the risk hedging function of the ETF, but it is also a sophisticated modelling procedure that necessitates a thorough understanding of market laws and economic importance. Based on China SSE 50 ETF, Harvest CSI 300 ETF, and high-frequency option data of 300ETF from Berry, this paper proposes another hybrid modelling method that consolidates the settled long-short-term memory neural network model (NLSTM) with the Heston model to acknowledge dynamic rectification of ETF choice price deviations. The research results show that the volatility characteristics of different types of ETF option prices are significantly different. Whether it is based on the BS pricing model or the Heston pricing model, it is difficult to accurately describe the complex changes in ETF option prices. By combining the NLSTM neural network model with the Heston model, it can effectively capture the dynamic changes of different types of ETF options, thereby improving the accuracy of ETF option pricing.",2023
Estimation of Canadian commodity market risk premiums under price limits: Two-phase fuzzy approach,"This paper is written with two complementary purposes in mind. The first is to provide estimates of systematic risk for Canadian commodities futures (western barley, canola, flaxseed, feed wheat) using a market portfolio based on a similar weighting scheme suggested by Marcus. The second is to estimate systematic risk with the induction of price limits in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the deployment of fuzzy regression method. A comparative investigation has been provided to show the importance of the fuzzy regression to estimate the existing risk premiums in the commodity futures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Asian Option Pricing Using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks Method,"Accurately calculating the prices ofAsian options is challenging due to their path- dependent characteristics and the high-dimensional nature of the problem. This study addresses this issue using a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach, which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and partial differential equation methods. By applying this PINN method to the pricing problems of one-asset and two-asset Asian options, we demonstrate that it can efficiently produce accurate price estimates compared to the traditional Monte Carlo method.",2025
An auto-realignment method in quasi-Monte Carlo for pricing financial derivatives with jump structures,"Discontinuities are common in the pricing of financial derivatives and have a tremendous impact on the accuracy of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method. While if the discontinuities are parallel to the axes, good efficiency of the QMC method can still be expected. By realigning the discontinuities to be axes-parallel, [Wang & Tan, 20131 succeeded in recovering the high efficiency of the QMC method for a special class of functions. Motivated by this work, we propose an auto-realignment method to deal with more general discontinuous functions. The k-means clustering algorithm, a classical algorithm of machine learning, is used to select the most representative normal vectors of the discontinuity surface. By applying this new method, the discontinuities of the resulting function are realigned to be friendly for the QMC method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the QMC method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016
A Gaussian Process Based Method with Deep Kernel Learning for Pricing High-Dimensional American Options,"In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach for pricing high-dimensional American options based on the modified Gaussian process regression (GPR). We incorporate deep kernel learning and sparse variational Gaussian processes to address the challenges traditionally associated with GPR. These challenges include its diminished reliability in high-dimensional scenarios and the excessive computational costs associated with processing extensive numbers of simulated paths. Our findings indicate that the proposed method surpasses the performance of the least squares Monte Carlo method in high-dimensional scenarios, particularly when the underlying assets are modeled by Merton's jump diffusion model. Moreover, our approach does not exhibit a significant increase in computational time as the number of dimensions grows. Consequently, this method emerges as a potential tool for alleviating the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality.",2025
Stochastic jump diffusion process informed neural networks for accurate American option pricing under data scarcity,"Pricing American options under jump diffusion models, such as the Merton model, presents significant challenges due to the early exercise feature and underlying price discontinuities. This paper introduces the PINN Merton model, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework that embeds the Merton partial integro differential equation (PIDE) into its loss function for American options pricing. By integrating sparse market data with financial physics, the model achieves robust pricing accuracy with limited training samples. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Merton PIDE from the L & eacute;vy process and prove the convergence of PINN Merton to the true option price under standard assumptions. Empirical evaluations on SPY and AAPL option datasets from June 2023 to September 2024 demonstrate that PINN Merton significantly outperforms traditional parametric models (e.g., Binomial Tree, Merton Jump Diffusion), data-driven baselines (e.g., Transformer, Neural Network, XGBoost), and PINN under the Black-Scholes formula (PINN BS), particularly in data-scarce scenarios. With only 200 training samples, PINN Merton achieves best performance, yielding an R2 of 0.9899 for SPY Calls (vs. 0.9654 for traditional Binomial Tree and 0.9617 for PINN BS), R2 of 0.9933 for SPY Puts (vs. 0.9924 for transformer), and R2 of 0.9897 for AAPL Calls (vs. 0.9822 for transformer), respectively. These results underscoring the model's effectiveness and generalizability across option types and underlying assets.",2025
Option valuation under no-arbitrage constraints with neural networks,"In this paper, we start from the no-arbitrage constraints in option pricing and develop a novel hybrid gated neural network (hGNN) based option valuation model. We adopt a multiplicative structure of hidden layers to ensure model differentiability. We also select the slope and weights of input layers to satisfy the no-arbitrage constraints. Meanwhile, a separate neural network is constructed for predicting option-implied volatilities. Using S&P 500 options, our empirical analyses show that the hGNN model substantially outperforms well-established alternative models in the out-of-sample forecasting and hedging exercises. The superior prediction performance stems from our model's ability in describing options on the boundary, and in offering analytical expressions for option Greeks which generate better hedging results.

Heston-GA Hybrid Option Pricing Model Based on ResNet50,"(1) Background. This study aims to improve the accuracy of the pricing model. (2) Methods. Heston model is combined with ResNet50 convolutional neural network model. Based on the optimization of Heston model parameters by genetic algorithm (GA), ResNet50 model is used to correct the deviation between market option price and Heston price, so a new hybrid option pricing model is established based on the empirical research on the European call options of Huatai-PB CSI 300ETF (code 510300), Harvest CSI 300ETF (code 159919), and SSE 50ETF (code 510050). (3) Results. The pricing result of the hybrid model is better than other single models and hybrid models. The model is applicable to the pricing of options with short and long remaining terms. (4) Conclusions. It is shown that the combination of Heston model and ResNet50 model with optimized parameters can ensure the interpretability of the model and enhance the nonlinear fitting ability of the model, which confirms the effectiveness of the hybrid model and provides a reference for investors and institutions to make scientific decisions.",2022
Optimal approximations for the free boundary problems of the space-time fractional Black-Scholes equations using a combined physics-informed neural network,"The combined physics-informed neural network is employed to deal with the free boundary problems of fractional Black-Scholes equations. The solution assumption and the loss function are determined, the transfer learning is borrowed, the combined neural network with data enhancement layer is designed, then the classical Black-Scholes model is numerically solved and the comparative analysis of numerical results under different neural networks is made. For further insight into the long-term memory of fluctuation, the free boundary problems of the space-time Black-Scholes equations under Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo fractional derivatives are studied. The corresponding empirical analyses are presented and the optimal exercise boundaries of American put option are simulated. The market analysis shows that introducing fractional calculus tools and neural network algorithms into American put option pricing can yield more realistic prediction results. The work provides a viable method for subsequent researchers to study American option pricing using fractional calculus and neural networks combined with true market data and to deal with the free boundary problems in other research fields.",2024
Pricing European Options with Deep Learning Models,"Applications of artificial neural networks for valuing financial options have a long history in academic research. When appropriately trained, these artificial neural networks have proved to obtain better results than traditional parametric models like Black-Scholes. This short paper intends to review the input variables and specific architecture of a multi-layer perceptron, long-short term memory and a convolutional neural network model for the purpose of pricing options. Additionally, it describes the data gathering process for the dataset that will be used to train these models.",2022
Application of deep learning to option hedging strategy,"The emergence of the digital information age has sparked considerable interest in predictive analytics within the realm of finance. Predicting uncertainty lies at the heart of Financial Engineering, where crafting investment or trading strategies using suitable prediction methods can optimize profits. This paper provides a novel work that approves the application of computer deep learning neural network has ability to predict volatility of the BlackScholes model and its derivatives. Employing a data-driven methodology, deep learning neural networks are utilized for volatility prediction, investigating their potential to enhance the accuracy of stock volatility forecasts and options pricing. Subsequently, the forecasted outcomes are leveraged for designing and executing hedging strategies, leading to the creation of three delta hedging approaches based on the anticipated stock volatility. The effectiveness of deep learning neural networks in volatility prediction is demonstrated, showcasing their ability to dynamically capture volatility shifts and outperform traditional models in forecasting accuracy.",2024
Tree-Based Methods of Volatility Prediction for the S&P 500 Index,"Predicting asset return volatility is one of the central problems in quantitative finance. These predictions are used for portfolio construction, calculation of value at risk (VaR), and pricing of derivatives such as options. Classical methods of volatility prediction utilize historical returns data and include the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH). These approaches have shown significantly higher rates of predictive accuracy than corresponding methods of return forecasting, but they still have vast room for improvement. In this paper, we propose and test several methods of volatility forecasting on the S&P 500 Index using tree ensembles from machine learning, namely random forest and gradient boosting. We show that these methods generally outperform the classical approaches across a variety of metrics on out-of-sample data. Finally, we use the unique properties of tree-based ensembles to assess what data can be particularly useful in predicting asset return volatility.",2025
Merged LSTM-MLP for option valuation,"Traditional option pricing models rely on estimates of expected volatility. The true volatility is not directly observable and must hence be estimated, inevitably with error. Any measurement errors immediately translate into inaccurate pricing, leading to potential losses for economic agents trading options for hedging or speculative purposes. This paper proposes a novel merged LSTM-MLP model for option pricing that circumvents the need for an explicit volatility estimate, leading to more accurate valuations. Through extensive out-of-sample testing on S&P500 call options data from 2015 to 2022 we document the statistical accuracy and economic benefits of the model when compared to relevant benchmarks. The superior performance is enabled by the combined LSTM-MLP architecture, which simultaneously utilizes both time series data and the cross-section of observed option characteristics in a deep learning neural network that accurately captures the complex price dynamics. The results are consistent over time and robust across option moneyness and time-to-expiry.",2025
Dynamic Pricing for EV Charging Stations: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Dynamic pricing, which aims to dynamically adjust the charging price in a timely fashion to unlock the flexibility of electric vehicle (EV) customers, has been extensively studied with the rapid development of charging technologies. Many existing works on dynamic pricing focus on maximizing the social welfare of charging service providers and EV customers. Cases of high-dimensional charging environments, which are often encountered with the rapid growth of EV market penetration, have been rarely considered to date. This article proposes a new dynamic pricing framework for EV charging stations that can offer multiple charging options to customers over a finite-time horizon. The charging price can be dynamically adjusted to maximize the quality of service (QoS) with a differentiated service requirement level (SRL) whenever the arrival rates and queuing system capacities of the charging systems are given at the end of a time period. The dynamic pricing problem is formulated as a finite-discrete horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with a mixed state space. A customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is employed to solve the examined EV dynamic pricing problem. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2022
On the dangers of a simplistic American option simulation valuation method,"Chen and Shen [Chen, A.-S., and P.-F. Shen. 2003. Computational complexity analysis of least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) for pricing US derivatives. Applied Economics Letters 10: 223-9] argue that we can improve the least squares Monte Carlo method (LSMC) to value American options by removing the least squares regression module. This would make it not only faster but also more accurate. We demonstrate, using a large sample of 2500 put options, that the proposed algorithm - the perfect foresight method (PFM) - is, as argued by the authors, faster than the LSMC algorithm but, contrary to what they state, it is not more accurate than the LSMC. In fact, the PFM algorithm incorrectly prices American options. We therefore, do not recommend the use of the PFM.",2010
Pricing Bermudan Options Using Regression Trees/Random Forests,"The value of an American option is the maximized value of the discounted cash flows from the option. At each time step, one needs to compare the immediate exercise value with the continuation value and decide to exercise as soon as the exercise value is strictly greater than the continuation value. We can formulate this problem as a dynamic programming equation, where the main difficulty comes from the computation of the conditional expectations representing the continuation values at each time step. In Longstaff and Schwartz [Rev. Financ. Studies, 14 (2001), pp. 113--147], these conditional expectations were estimated using regressions on a finite-dimensional vector space (typically a polynomial basis). In this paper, we follow the same algorithm; only the conditional expectations are estimated using regression trees or random forests. We discuss the convergence of the Longstaff and Schwartz algorithm when the standard least squares regression is replaced by regression trees. Finally, we expose some numerical results with regression trees and random forests. The random forest algorithm gives excellent results in high dimensions.",2023
Impact of international energy prices on China's industries,"This study examines how returns and volatility of future contracts for Brent crude oil (Brent), West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI), Henry Hub natural gas, and Newcastle thermal coal impacts industries in China. Using the firm-level data of 3,750 stock listings across both Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, segregated into 138 subindustries under the Global Industry Classification Standard, this study finds evidence that crude oil futures have the most significant influence. Further analysis suggests that stock returns of oil-related companies are more closely align to Brent and WTI's futures returns following China's key oil pricing reform on March 27, 2013. Overall, Chinese industries are also more exposed to global crude oil futures volatility after this event.",2020
Regression methods for pricing complex American-Style options,"We introduce and analyze a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming method for pricing complex American-style options, with a possibly high-dimensional underlying state space. We work within a finitely parameterized family of approximate value functions, and introduce a variant of value iteration, adapted to this parametric setting. We also introduce a related method which uses a single (parameterized) value function, which is a function of the time-state pair, as opposed to using a separate (independently parameterized) value function for each time, Our methods involve the evaluation of value functions at a finite set, consisting of representative elements of the state space, We show that with an arbitrary choice of this set, the approximation error can grow exponentially with the time horizon (time to expiration). On the other hand, if representative states are chosen by simulating the state process using the underlying risk-neutral probability distribution, then the approximation error remains bounded.",2001
Pricing vanilla options using artificial neural networks: Application to the South African market,"In this paper, a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) is used to price Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Top 40 European call options using a constructed implied volatility surface. The prices generated by the ANN were compared to the prices obtained using the Black-Scholes (BS) model. It was found that the pricing performance of the ANN significantly improves when the number of training samples are increased and that ANNs are able to price European call options in the South African market with a high degree of accuracy.",2021
Decreased price clustering in FTSE 100 futures contracts following a transfer from floor to electronic trading,"The issues of price clustering and electronic trading have triggered important recent debates,, and generated interest from regulators due to their potential implications for market quality, stability, and fairness. This paper brings together these issues by examining whether price-clustering behavior differs following a transfer of futures contracts from open outcry trading to an electronic system. The results are unique in demonstrating a structural change in price clustering following the move to automated trading, with the level of price clustering dropping from around 98.5% of prices at even ticks under floor trading to approximately 75% under electronic trading. Such a change in pricing behavior amounts to a reduction in the effective tick size, and is an important factor in reducing observed bid-ask spreads. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2003
Currency total return swaps: valuation and risk factor analysis,"Currency total return swaps (CTRS) are hybrid derivative instruments that allow us to simultaneously hedge against credit and currency risks. We develop a structural credit risk model to evaluate CTRS premia. An empirical test on a sample of 23,005 price observations from 59 underlying issuers yields an average percentage error of around 10%. This indicates that, beyond interest rate risk, firm-specific factors are major drivers of the variations in the valuation of these instruments. Regression analysis of residuals shows that exchange rate determinants account for up to 40% of model pricing errors, indicating that a currency risk premium affects the CTRS price significantly but only marginally, which confirms the prevalence of credit risk in the pricing of CTRS.",2013
"Water transfer from agriculture to urban uses: lessons learned, with policy considerations","This paper sets forth the accomplishments to date of the international collaborative study program on efficient and equitable transfer of water from agriculture to other uses. The research consists of several components. First a bibliographical review was prepared of literature available on the practice of inter-sector water transfer. Second, nine case studies have been prepared that illustrate inter-sector water transfer under a variety of physical and economic and political environments. Third, a framework has been developed for characterizing and comparing water transfer options and compensation among case studies. We discuss the pricing of irrigation water in determining compensation. We develop a decision tree that traces the paths to the various sector water transfer options. Finally, we discuss water transfer policy options with specific reference to Taiwan, though they have more general relevance. Three options are identified which reflect different objectives for government intervention.",2007
Forecasting and trading currency volatility: An application of recurrent neural regression and model combination,"In this paper, we examine the use of non-parametric Neural Network Regression (NNR) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) regression models for forecasting and trading currency volatility, with an application to the GBP/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. Both the results of the NNR and RNN models are benchmarked against the simpler GARCH alternative and implied volatility. Two simple model combinations are also analysed. The intuitively appealing idea of developing a nonlinear nonparametric approach to forecast FX volatility, identify mispriced options and subsequently develop a trading strategy based upon this process is implemented for the first time on a comprehensive basis. Using daily data from December 1993 through April 1999, we develop alternative FX volatility forecasting models. These models are then tested out-of-sample over the period April 1999-May 2000, not only in terms of forecasting accuracy, but also in terms of trading efficiency: in order to do so, we apply a realistic volatility trading strategy using FX option straddles once mispriced options have been identified. Allowing for transaction costs, most trading strategies retained produce positive returns. RNN models appear as the best single modelling approach yet, somewhat surprisingly, model combination which has the best overall performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, fails to improve the RNN-based volatility trading results. Another conclusion from our results is that, for the period and currencies considered, the currency option market was inefficient and/or the pricing formulae applied by market participants were inadequate.

Gated Neural Networks for Option Pricing: Rationality by Design,"We propose a neural network approach to price EU call options that significantly outperforms some existing pricing models and comes with guarantees that its predictions are economically reasonable. To achieve this, we introduce a class of gated neural networks that automatically learn to divide-and-conquer the problem space for robust and accurate pricing. We then derive instantiations of these networks that are 'rational by design' in terms of naturally encoding a valid call option surface that enforces no arbitrage principles. This integration of human insight within data-driven learning provides significantly better generalisation in pricing performance due to the encoded inductive bias in the learning, guarantees sanity in the model's predictions, and provides econometrically useful byproduct such as risk neutral density.",2017
Collaborative processing of Least-Square Monte Carlo for American Options,"American options are popularly traded in the financial market, so pricing those options becomes crucial in practice. In reality, many popular pricing models do not have analytical solutions. Hence techniques such as Monte Carlo are often used in practice. This paper presents a CPU-FPGA collaborative accelerator using state-of-the-art Least-Square Monte Carlo method, for pricing American options. We provide a new sequence of generating the Monte Carlo paths, and a pre-calculation strategy for the regression process. Our design is customisable for different pricing models, discretisation schemes, and regression functions. The Heston model is used as a case study for evaluating our strategy. Experimental results show that an FPGA-based solution could provide 22 to 64.5 times faster than a single-core CPU implementation.",2014
Pricing Bermudan options under Merton jump-diffusion asset dynamics,"In this paper, a recently developed regression-based option pricing method, the Stochastic Grid Bundling Method (SGBM), is considered for pricing multidimensional Bermudan options. We compare SGBM with a traditional regression-based pricing approach and present detailed insight in the application of SGBM, including how to configure it and how to reduce the uncertainty of its estimates by control variates. We consider the Merton jump-diffusion model, which performs better than the geometric Brownian motion in modelling the heavy-tailed features of asset price distributions. Our numerical tests show that SGBM with appropriate set-up works highly satisfactorily for pricing multidimensional options under jump-diffusion asset dynamics.",2015
Fast pricing of American options under variance gamma,"We investigate methods for pricing American options under the variance gamma model. The variance gamma process is a pure jump process that is constructed by replacing the calendar time with the gamma time in a Brownian motion with drift, resulting in a time-changed Brownian motion. In the case of the Black-Merton- Scholes model, there exist fast approximation methods for pricing American options. However, these methods cannot be used for the variance gamma model. We develop a new fast and accurate approximation method - inspired by the quadratic approximation - to get rid of the time steps required in finite-difference and simulation methods, while reducing error by making use of a machine learning technique on precalculated quantities. We compare the performance of our method with those of the existing methods and show that our method is efficient and accurate in the context of practical use.",2021
Financial Option Valuation by Unsupervised Learning with Artificial Neural Networks,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently also been applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). The classical problem of pricing European and American financial options, based on the corresponding PDE formulations, is studied here. Instead of using numerical techniques based on finite element or difference methods, we address the problem using ANNs in the context of unsupervised learning. As a result, the ANN learns the option values for all possible underlying stock values at future time points, based on the minimization of a suitable loss function. For the European option, we solve the linear Black-Scholes equation, whereas for the American option we solve the linear complementarity problem formulation. Two-asset exotic option values are also computed, since ANNs enable the accurate valuation of high-dimensional options. The resulting errors of the ANN approach are assessed by comparing to the analytic option values or to numerical reference solutions (for American options, computed by finite elements). In the short note, previously published, a brief introduction to this work was given, where some ideas to price vanilla options by ANNs were presented, and only European options were addressed. In the current work, the methodology is introduced in much more detail.",2021
Lumber Futures and Timberland Investment,"Using 20 years of data, we derive a pricing model for timberland market values. We examine the relationship between lumber futures, capitalization rates, anticipated inflation, anticipated construction, and timberland value. Using an ordinary least squares regression model and Johansen's (1988) cointegration technique, we find that timberland market values have a long-run significant positive equilibrium relationship with lumber futures and building permits. Capitalization rates have a significant negative relationship as expected. In the short run, unanticipated shocks in the independent variables provide a permanent change in timberland market values.",2011
Data-driven option pricing using single and multi-asset supervised learning,"We propose three different data-driven approaches for pricing European-style call options using supervised machine-learning algorithms. These approaches yield models that give a range of fair prices instead of a single price point. The performance of the models is tested on two stock market indices: NIFTY50 and BANKNIFTY from the Indian equity market. Although neither historical nor implied volatility is used as an input, the results show that the trained models have been able to capture the option pricing mechanism better than or similar to the Black-Scholes formula for all the experiments. Our choice of scale free I/O allows us to train models using combined data of multiple different assets from a financial market. This not only allows the models to achieve far better generalization and predictive capability, but also solves the problem of paucity of data, the primary limitation of using machine learning techniques. We also illustrate the performance of the trained models in the period leading up to the 2020 Stock Market Crash (January 2019 to April 2020).",2021
The impact of counterparty risk on credit default swap pricing dynamics,"As observed throughout the financial crisis in 2008, credit default swaps (CDSs) are exposed not only to the credit risk of the underlying reference entity but also to the counterparty risk of the protection seller. Conducting a panel regression analysis based on CDS contracts from 2004 to 2009 in Europe and North America for 198 reference entities, we find that market-oriented counterparty risk measures are reflected in the pricing of CDS contracts. The impact of counterparty risk decreases when increased creditworthiness of the underlying reference entity occurs. We show that counterparty risk had already been incorporated in the CDS spreads for North American reference entities prior to the financial crisis, whereas, for European reference entities, the pricing impact only intensified with the outbreak of the financial crisis in September 2008. Market-based counterparty risk measures have a higher impact on the pricing of CDS contracts compared with measures that rely on the correlation structures of asset returns of reference entities and CDS counterparties.",2012
The predictive effect of heterogeneous investor behavior on commodity pricing,"This study examines how commodity financialization-marked by surging capital inflows and new financial instruments like ETFs-affects commodity pricing dynamics by analyzing inventory-linked convenience yield and investor behavior. Based on the extended theory of storage, using futures market data from 1994 to 2021, this paper examines the efficiency of the factor models in capturing financialization in commodity markets. Furthermore, Fama-MacBeth regression, structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, and several statistical indicators are adopted to illustrate the roles of heterogeneous investor behavior in explaining and forecasting commodity pricing. The empirical results can be summarized as follows. Firstly, a financialization-inclusive two-factor model outperforms a single-factor model in aligning with actual commodity futures prices and their term structure. Secondly, non-commercial traders dominate trend-following trades, while commercial traders dominate counter-trend trades. Thirdly, heterogeneous investors' positions have both short- and long-term predictive effects on commodity prices. In summary, this paper demonstrates the importance of investor behavior for commodity pricing and provides policymakers with regulatory insights.",2025
Nonparametric regression via higher degree F-transform for implied volatility surface estimation,"Estimation of the implied volatility surface is a crucial step for pricing of illiquid or non-listed options. For its estimation we use market data of traded liquid options. In order to obtain smooth surface we mostly use some nonparametric regression approach, though some combination of market data can lead to the inconsistency of the estimated values (i.e. leading to arbitrage opportunities). In this contribution we focus on a novel nonparametric regression approach based on fuzzy transform technique. The original definition is extended into multivariate higher degree F-transform so that we are able to smooth (2 + 1) D discrete data. Proposed procedure allows us to calculate also partial derivatives of the estimated function easily. Extending the optimization problem by suitable constraint we can prevent most of the sources of arbitrage related to option valuation with implied volatility smiles.",2016
"American Options in Time-Dependent One-Factor Models: Semi-Analytic Pricing, Numerical Methods, and ML Support","Semi -analytical pricing of American options in a time -dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model was presented in Carr and Itkin (2021). It was shown that to obtain these prices one needs to numerically solve a nonlinear Volterra integral equation of the second kind to find the exercise boundary, which is a function of the time only. Once this is done, the option prices follow. It was also shown that computationally this method is as efficient as the forward finite difference solver, while also providing better accuracy and stability. Later this approach, called the generalized integral transform method, was significantly extended to various time -dependent one factor (Itkin et al. 2021) and stochastic volatility (Carr et al. 2022, Itkin and Muravey 2022b) models as applied to pricing barrier options. For American options, though, despite being possible, this was not explicitly reported anywhere. In this article our goal is to fill this gap and also discuss which numerical method can be efficient to solve the corresponding Volterra equations, also including machine learning.",2024
OPTION PRICING USING STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODEL UNDER FOURIER TRANSFORM OF NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION,"The purposes are to solve the option pricing problem in financial derivatives and provide a practical basis for reducing the risk rate of the financial market. First, the classification of fractal theory and option pricing is outlined, the connotation of stochastic volatility is analyzed, and a stochastic volatility model is established. According to the Fourier transform and nonlinear differential equation, the pricing method in the volatility swap process and the pricing method of volatility derivatives are analyzed. Finally, the option pricing parameters are set, and the Origin 75 software is employed to visually analyze the mathematical results. The forward prices under stochastic volatility are compared monthly and weekly, and the resulted values are all close to 235. There is a gap between the forward prices of each month and each quarter, and the difference between the forward prices of each quarter is large, close to 50. The average relative percentage errors (ARPEs) within and out of the sample calculated by the stochastic volatility model are close to 16%, and the error gaps between different monetary intervals are also large. With the increase in strike price, the change rate of options under the random volatility model is faster than that of options under VIX index. When the strike price increases to 0.6, the two options are equal. The fitting trend of the stochastic volatility model for implied volatility at different maturity dates first decreases and then tends to a fixed value. The implied volatility of the 60-day-expiring option has changed significantly, showing a trend of increasing first and then tending to a fixed value (0.8). In contrast, the implied volatility of the 90-day-expiring option and the 120-day-expiring option almost have no change. When w (fractional operator) takes 1 and Y takes 1.6 and 1.3, the solution to the stochastic volatility model is consistent with that to the classic CGMY model. When w takes 1, the stochastic volatility model has the same solution as the classic CGMY and BS models. As the fractional order of time increases, the trend of asset price changes becomes smaller.",2022
Deep multitask neural networks for solving some stochastic optimal control problems,"Most existing neural network-based approaches for solving stochastic optimal control problems using the associated backward dynamic programming principle rely on the ability to simulate the underlying state variables. However, in some problems, this simulation is infeasible, leading to the discretization of state variable space and the need to train one neural network for each data point. This approach becomes computationally inefficient when dealing with large state variable spaces. In this paper, we consider a class of this type of stochastic optimal control problems and introduce an effective solution employing multitask neural networks. To train our multitask neural network, we introduce a novel scheme that dynamically balances the learning across tasks. Through numerical experiments on realworld derivatives pricing problems, we prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",2024
American option pricing using Bayesian multi-layer perceptrons and Bayesian support vector machines,"An option is the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a later date but by fixing the price of the asset now. There are European and American styled options... European styled options can be priced using the Black-Scholes equations but American options are more complex and valuable due to the second random process they introduce. Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines have been used previously to price American options and what is introduced here is Bayesian Techniques to both these approaches. Bayesian techniques used with both these approaches are compared in terms of pricing accuracy and time to train each of the learning algorithms. It was found that Bayesian SVM's out-performed Bayesian MLP's and that there is scope for further work. However, Bayesian SVM's took much longer to train than Bayesian MLP's even though they produced better error results.",2005
Stochastic model genetic programming: Deriving pricing equations for rainfall weather derivatives,"Rainfall derivatives are in their infancy since starting trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 2011. Being a relatively new class of financial instruments there is no generally recognised pricing framework used within the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm for pricing contracts. Our novel algorithm, which is called Stochastic Model GP (SMGP), is able to generate and evolve stochastic equations of rainfall, which allows us to probabilistically transform rainfall predictions from the risky world to the risk-neutral world. In order to achieve this, SMGP's representation allows its individuals to comprise of two weighted parts, namely a seasonal component and an autoregressive component. To create the stochastic nature of an equation for each SMGP individual, we estimate the weights by using a probabilistic approach. We evaluate the models produced by SMGP in terms of rainfall predictive accuracy and in terms of pricing performance on 42 cities from Europe and the USA. We compare SMGP to 8 methods: its predecessor DGP, 5 well-known machine learning methods (M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Function), and two statistical methods, namely AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Monte Carlo Rainfall Prediction (MCRP). Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to statistically outperform all other algorithms.",2019
Physical information-guided multidirectional gated recurrent unit network fusing attention to solve the Black-Scholes equation,"Reasonable option pricing is crucial in the financial derivatives market. Finding analytical solutions for the Black-Scholes (BS) equation, particularly for American options or with fluctuating volatility and interest rates, is challenging. BS equations exhibit strong time-series characteristics, with asset prices typically adhering to geometric Brownian motion. To address the BS equations, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model guided by physical information (PI), called PiMGA. The PiMGA fuses a multidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) network with an attention module, where multidirectional GRU enhances the coding performance of the input sequences and the attention module balances the feature weights of the hidden variables. Prior physical knowledge in BS equations is jointly used as a constraint, forming the penalty function for objective optimization. This allows PiMGA to serve as an efficient approximation function in the learning paradigm of physically informed machine learning to solve BS equations. BS equations with various complexities illustrate the accuracy and feasibility of PiMGA for numerical solutions. Furthermore, the out-of-distribution generalization ability of PiMGA is verified by predicting the Nasdaq 100 index.",2025
DeepOption: A novel option pricing framework based on deep learning with fused distilled data from multiple parametric methods,"The remarkable performance of deep learning is based on its ability to learn high-level features by processing large amounts of data. This exceptionally superior performance has attracted the attention of researchers studying option pricing. However, option data are more expensive and less accessible than other types of data and are imbalanced because of the liquidity of options. This motivated us to propose a new option pricing and delta-hedging framework called DeepOption. This framework, which is based on deep learning, can improve the performance even when applying imbalanced real option data. In particular, the framework fuses simulated big data, known as distilled data, obtained using various traditional parametric methods. The proposed model employs the following three-stage training approach: Our model is pre-trained using big distilled data after it is finetuned using real option data through transfer learning. Finally, a delta branch is added to the model and trained. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method using three sets of real option data, namely S&P 500 European call options, EuroStoxx50 call options, and Hang Seng Index put options. Our experimental results on option pricing demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms parametric methods and other machine learning methods. Specifically, our model, which uses pre-training with distilled data, reduces the overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by more than 50%, compared with that of a deep learning model using only real option data without pre-training.",2021
Nonlinearities in carbon spot-futures price relationships during Phase II of the EU ETS,"This paper uses the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and the Switching Transition Regression-Exponential GARCH models (STR-EGARCH) to examine the dynamic relationships between the EU Emission Allowances (EUA) spot and futures prices during Phase II. Compared to the majority of previous studies, our empirical approach allows us to simultaneously capture asymmetry and nonlinearity effects in both return and volatility processes of carbon allowance prices. Our main findings show that carbon spot and futures returns are asymmetrically and nonlinearly linked, suggesting the usefulness of nonlinear models in pricing and forecasting carbon allowances prices.

On application of nonparametric regression estimation to options pricing,"We consider American options also called Bermudan options in discrete time. We use the dual approach to derive upper bounds on the price of such options using only a reduced number of nested Monte Carlo steps. The key idea is to use nonparametric regression to estimate continuation values and all other required conditional expectations and to combine the resulting estimate with another estimate computed by using only a reduced number of nested Monte Carlo steps. The mean value of the resulting estimate is an upper bound on the option price. One can show that the estimates of the option prices are universally consistent, i.e., they converge to the true price regardless of the structure of the continuation values. The finite sample behavior is validated by experiments on simulated data.",2009
Option Pricing by Fuzzy Logic Based Signal Processing,"One of the best examples of mathematically rigorous signal processing in finance is the Black-Scholes model for price evolution of financial options. To address the same problem, this paper proposes a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule-based option pricing model that requires only a small number of rules to describe highly complex financial signals such as option prices. The findings for this data-driven approach indicate that the TSK model presents a robust option pricing tool that is superior to an array of well-known parametric models from the literature, including the Black-Scholes model. In addition, its predictive performance is consistently no worse than that of a non-parametric feedforward neural network model.",2011
Hedging under the influence of transaction costs: An empirical investigation on FTSE 100 index options,"The Black-Scholes (BS; F. Black & M. Scholes, 1973) option pricing model, and modern parametric option pricing models in general, assume that a single unique price for the underlying instrument exists, and that it is the mid- (the average of the ask and the bid) price. In this article the authors consider the Financial Times and London Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index Options for the time period 1992-1997. They estimate the ask and bid prices for the index, and show that, when substituted for the mid-price in the BS formula, they provide superior option price predictors, for call and put options, respectively. This result is reinforced further when they fit a non-parametric neural network model to market prices of liquid options. The empirical findings in this article suggest that the ask and bid prices of the underlying asset provide a superior fit to the mid/closing price because they include market maker's, compensation for providing liquidity in the market for constituent stocks of the FTSE 100 index.

Quantum-inspired variational algorithms for partial differential equations: application to financial derivative pricing,"Variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) combined with neural-network quantum states offers a novel angle of attack on the curse-of-dimensionality encountered in a particular class of partial differential equations (PDEs); namely, the real- and imaginary time-dependent Schrodinger equation. In this paper, we present a simple generalization of VMC applicable to arbitrary time-dependent PDEs, showcasing the technique in the multi-asset Black-Scholes PDE for pricing European options contingent on many correlated underlying assets.",2023
A CNN based system for predicting the implied volatility and option prices,"The evaluations of option prices and implied volatility are critical for option risk management and trading. Common strategies in existing studies relied on the parametric models. However, these models are based on several idealistic assumptions. In addition, previous research on option pricing mainly depends on the historical transaction records without considering the performance of other concurrent options. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based system for predicting the implied volatility and the option prices. Specifically, the customized non-parametric learning approach is first used to estimate the implied volatility. Second, several traditional parametric models are also implemented to estimate these prices as well. The convolutional neural network is utilized to obtain the predictions based on the estimation of the implied volatility. Our experiments based on Chinese SSE 50 ETF options demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the traditional methods with at least 40.11% performance enhancement in terms of RMSE.",2020
Pricing options with dual volatility input to modular neural networks,"Tested is the choice of the volatility input to the artificial neural networks in the process of pricing options. Numerous studies concluded the weaknesses of Black-Scholes model use as a pricing tool in the market. For the last two decades, various studies were done analyzing the alternate tools to price options. Among the alternates is the use of artificial neural networks. While Gradojevic, Gencay, and Kukolj (2009) use Modular back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) without any volatility related inputs, others like Y.H. Wang (2009a, 2009b), Lin and Yeh (2009), Wang, Lin, Huang, Wu (2012), and Chang, Wang and Yeh (2013) test different options of a volatility input and compare the final artificial neural network (ANN) outcome. This paper provides volatility input to the BPNN, first the selected historical volatility estimate followed by the implied volatility as single volatility input to ANN. Finally, trained is the ANN with input inclusive of the combination of the two volatility measures. Accordingly, dual-volatility model outperformance suggests that each of the volatility inputs provides some exclusive information to the ANN to price options.

Is Reinforcement Learning Good at American Option Valuation?,"This paper investigates algorithms for identifying the optimal policy for pricing American Options. The American Option pricing is reformulated as a Sequential Decision-Making problem with two binary actions (Exercise or Continue), transforming it into an optimal stopping time problem. Both the least square Monte Carlo simulation method (LSM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods were utilized to find the optimal policy and, hence, the fair value of the American Put Option. Both Classical Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and calibrated Stochastic Volatility models served as the underlying uncertain assets. The novelty of this work lies in two aspects: (1) Applying LSM- and RL-based methods to determine option prices, with a specific focus on analyzing the dynamics of Decisions made by each method and comparing final decisions chosen by the LSM and RL methods. (2) Assess how the RL method updates Decisions at each batch, revealing the evolution of the decisions during the learning process to achieve optimal policy.",2024
How Do Options Add Value? Evidence from the Convertible Bond Market*,"This paper studies the value relevance of the options market by focusing on convertible bond pricing. Pricing convertible bonds requires essentially the same set of information necessary to price options. Using a regression discontinuity design based on minimum stock price requirements for option listings, we find that the availability of stock options helps issuers attract more convertible bond buyers and reduces convertible issuers' cost of financing. Our results highlight that the availability of individual stock options can add value to security issuers.",2023
Pricing derivatives by path integral and neural networks,"Recent progress in the development of efficient computational algorithms to price financial derivatives is summarized. A first algorithm is based on a path integral approach to option pricing, while a second algorithm makes use of a neural network parameterization of option prices. The accuracy of the two methods is established from comparisons with the results of the standard procedures used in quantitative finance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",2003
Deep Learning and American Options via Free Boundary Framework,"We propose a deep learning method for solving the American options model with a free boundary feature. To extract the free boundary known as the early exercise boundary from our proposed method, we introduce the Landau transformation. For efficient implementation of our proposed method, we further construct an implicit dual solution framework consisting of a novel auxiliary function and free boundary equations. The auxiliary function is formulated to include the feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) output and further mimic the far boundary behaviour, smooth pasting condition, and remaining boundary conditions due to the second-order space derivative and first-order time derivative. Because the early exercise boundary and its derivative are not a priori known, the boundary values mimicked by the auxiliary function are in approximate form. Concurrently, we then establish equations that approximate the early exercise boundary and its derivative directly from the DNN output based on some linear relationships at the left boundary. Furthermore, the option Greeks are obtained from the derivatives of this auxiliary function. We test our implementation with several examples and compare them with the existing numerical methods. All indicators show that our proposed deep learning method presents an efficient and alternative way of pricing options with early exercise features.",2024
"A Time-Varying, Feature- Rearranged Convolutional Neural Network for Option Pricing","The rigid assumptions underlying conventional parametric option-pricing models prevent them from accurately capturing the underlying nature of the market. Most of these models must be estimated numerically, because they cannot be solved analytically, which inevitably leads to estimation errors. Previous studies of option pricing, which have focused primarily on a single option variable, have not taken into account the effects of other options traded within the same time period. In order to address these issues, the authors use convolutional neural network (CNN) pattern recognition to fit the option panel data and provide a feature-rearrangement mechanism to account for the correlations between non-adjacent options. The suggested feature-rearranged CNN (FR-CNN) model is entirely data-driven without any preliminary assumptions. The authors' experiments with the Chinese SSE 50 ETF option show that the proposed FR-CNN outperformed the jump-diffusion model and CNN by 59.59% and 17.34%, respectively.",2024

It presents the latest methods in OR to address risks and uncertainties in these systems, covering topics such as options pricing, portfolio optimization, banking resilience, and the analysis of financial and economic co-movements. The included studies utilize advanced analytical tools, like stochastic programming, decision analysis, and machine learning, to create robust models for complex systems.

Demand response model: A cooperative-competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning approach,"This study introduces a novel Demand Response (DR) Model based on Multi -agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL -DR), comprised of a pricing and incentives scheme aimed at improving the accuracy of existing demand response strategies. Furthermore, this new approach represents a flexibility solution to prevent sharp price variations caused by the high penetration of unconventional renewable energy, which are directly passed on to end -users. The model employs a cooperative -competitive MARL -DR technique based on Q -learning, with the goal of determining optimal prices and incentives that maximize benefits for both customers and electric Service Provider (SP). In this regard, the model has the capability to offer customers pricing options in both real-time and time -of -use, to actively adjust each user's consumption. Additionally, through demand characterization factors, such as the coincidence factor (CF), the of typical user behavior is improved, and the influence of individual user demand on system peak demand is more accurately detected. It is also demonstrated that the cooperativecompetitive approach offers better performance compared to other approaches. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is presented at various stages of the model to verify its accuracy and efficiency in pricing and incentives formulation.",2024
A new deep neural network algorithm for multiple stopping with applications in options pricing,"In this paper, we propose a deep learning method to solve high-dimensional optimal multiple stopping problems. We represent the policies of multiple stopping problems by the composition of functions. Using the new representation, we approximate the optimal stopping policy recursively with simulation samples. We also derive lower and upper bounds and confidence intervals for the values. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the pricing of swing options, and it produces accurate results in high-dimensional problems.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2023
Trading and Pricing Sensor Data in Competing Edge Servers with Double Auction Markets,"With the development of the IoT (Internet of Things), sensors networks can bring a large amount of valuable data. In addition to be utilized in the local IoT applications, the data can also be traded in the connected edge servers. As an efficient resource allocation mechanism, the double auction has been widely used in the stock and futures markets and can be also applied in the data resource allocation in sensor networks. Currently, there usually exist multiple edge servers running double auctions competing with each other to attract data users (buyers) and producers (sellers). Therefore, the double auction market run on each edge server needs efficient mechanism to improve the allocation efficiency. Specifically, the pricing strategy of the double auction plays an important role on affecting traders' profit, and thus, will affect the traders' market choices and bidding strategies, which in turn affect the competition result of double auction markets. In addition, the traders' trading strategies will also affect the market's pricing strategy. Therefore, we need to analyze the double auction markets' pricing strategy and traders' trading strategies. Specifically, we use a deep reinforcement learning algorithm combined with mean field theory to solve this problem with a huge state and action space. For trading strategies, we use the Independent Parametrized Deep Q-Network (I-PDQN) algorithm combined with mean field theory to compute the Nash equilibrium strategies. We then compare it with the fictitious play (FP) algorithm. The experimental results show that the computation speed of I-PDQN algorithm is significantly faster than that of FP algorithm. For pricing strategies, the double auction markets will dynamically adjust the pricing strategy according to traders' trading strategies. This is a sequential decision-making process involving multiple agents. Therefore, we model it as a Markov game. We adopt Multiagent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm to analyze the Nash equilibrium pricing strategies. The experimental results show that the MADDPG algorithm solves the problem faster than the FP algorithm.",2021
Improving neural network based option price forecasting,"As is widely known, the popular Black & Scholes model for option pricing suffers from systematic biases, as it relies on several highly questionable assumptions. In this paper we study the ability of neural networks (MLPs) in pricing call options on the S&P 500 index; in particular we investigate the effect of the hidden neurons in the in- and out-of-sample pricing. We modify the Black & Scholes model given the price of an option based on the no-arbitrage value of a forward contract, written on the same underlying asset, and we derive a modified formula that can be used for our purpose. Instead of using the standard backpropagation training algorithm we replace it with the Levenberg-Marquardt approach. By modifying the objective function of the neural network, we focus the learning process on more interesting areas of the implied volatility surface. The results from this transformation are encouraging.",2006
European Option Pricing by Using the Support Vector Regression Approach,"We explore the pricing performance of Support Vector Regression for pricing S&P 500 index call options. Support Vector Regression is a novel nonparametric methodology that has been developed in the context of statistical learning theory, and until now it has not been widely used in financial econometric applications. This new method is compared with the Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing model, using standard implied parameters and parameters derived via the Deterministic Volatility Functions approach. The empirical analysis has shown promising results for the Support Vector Regression models.",2009
DECISION TREE ANALYSIS VS. REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF ENERGY PROJECTS,"Commonly accepted and preferred methodology of economic evaluation of energy projects is discounted cash flow analysis (DCF). Though, for the reason of ignoring managerial flexibility, this approach is not the most suitable evaluation technique for high-risk ventures. The pricing of flexibility enable advanced methods of economic evaluation such us decision tree analysis (DTA) and real options valuation (ROV or ROA). Both approaches use decision nodes for hierarchical structurization of decision problem taking into account all real operation alternatives. The paper, perceiving common features of both approaches, emphasizes advantages of the ROV analysis which are mainly connected with avoiding of constant RADR problem and applying, in return, the risk-free rate which is independent of project risk structure.",2011
A spatially-continuous neural network temperature model for weather derivatives evaluation,"This manuscript develops a spatially continuous temperature model for pricing weather derivatives. We formulate temperature at any specific point as a function of its longitude and latitude coordinates. Using satellite climate data, we learn this function using deep neural networks and use it to model and forecast temperature. More specifically, our model allows for describing temperature dynamics at any point within the zone of interest, even when there is no available temperature data at that specific location. This approach enhances our ability to evaluate climate risk with greater precision across different regions. Furthermore, we design a neural network architecture that maintains model explainability, which is crucial for promoting the use of these methods in real-life applications. Through numerical experiments with NASA-MERRA-2 satellite data, we illustrate the model's application in pricing Heating Degree Day (HDD) derivatives. Additionally, we explore potential extensions of the model to improve forecasting accuracy further.",2025
Numerical Solution of Time Fractional Black-Scholes Model Based on Legendre Wavelet Neural Network with Extreme Learning Machine,"In this paper, the Legendre wavelet neural network with extreme learning machine is proposed for the numerical solution of the time fractional Black-Scholes model. In this way, the operational matrix of the fractional derivative based on the two-dimensional Legendre wavelet is derived and employed to solve the European options pricing problem. This scheme converts this problem into the calculation of a set of algebraic equations. The Legendre wavelet neural network is constructed; meanwhile, the extreme learning machine algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning rate and avoid the over-fitting problem. In order to evaluate the performance of this scheme, a comparative study with the implicit differential method is constructed to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. Experimental results illustrate that this scheme offers a satisfactory numerical solution compared to the benchmark method.",2022
"Pricing and hedging derivative securities with neural networks:: Bayesian regularization, early stopping, and bagging","We study the effectiveness of cross validation, Bayesian regularization, early stopping, and bagging to mitigate overfitting and improving generalization for pricing and hedging derivative securities with daily S&P 500 index daily call options from January 1988 to December 1993, Our results indicate that Bayesian regularization can generate significantly smaller pricing and delta-hedging errors than the baseline neural-network (NN) model and the Black-Scholes model for some gears. While early stopping does not affect the pricing errors, it significantly reduces the hedging error in four of the six years we investigated. Although computationally most demanding, bagging seems to provide the most accurate pricing and delta-hedging, Furthermore, the standard deviation of the MSPE of bagging is far less than that of the baseline model in all six years, and the standard deviation of the AHE of bagging is far less than that of the baseline model in five out of six years, Since we find in general these regularization methods work as effectively as homogeneity hint, we suggest they be used at least in cases when no appropriate hints are available.",2001
Sequential Design for Optimal Stopping Problems,"We propose a new approach to solving optimal stopping problems via simulation. Working within the backward dynamic programming/Snell envelope framework, we augment the methodology of Longstaff and Schwartz that focuses on approximating the stopping strategy. Namely, we introduce adaptive generation of the stochastic grids anchoring the simulated sample paths of the underlying state process. This allows for active learning of the classifiers partitioning the state space into the continuation and stopping regions. To this end, we examine sequential design schemes that adaptively place new design points close to the stopping boundaries. We then discuss dynamic regression algorithms that can implement such recursive estimation and local refinement of the classifiers. The new algorithm is illustrated with a variety of numerical experiments, showing that an order of magnitude savings in terms of design size can be achieved. We also compare with existing benchmarks in the context of pricing multidimensional Bermudan options.",2015
Reinforcement Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Demand Response in Microgrid Charging Stations,"Reinforcement learning has become an important scheduling solution with many successes in markets with dynamic pricing options, e.g., electric vehicle charging in a deregulated electricity market. However, the highly-uncertain requests and partially-unknown individual preferences remain major challenges to effective demand responses in the user-centric environment. For charging stations who aim to maximize the long-term revenue in this fast-growing market, an accurate estimate of user's sensitivity, or acceptance, of the prices they offered to the potential customers is the key to the success of dynamic pricing. While most existing pricing schemes assume users will consistently follow stable patterns that are observable or inferrable by the charging service provider, it remains crucial to consider how users may be influenced by historic prices they have observed and react strategically to decide optimal charging demands that can maximize their utilities. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new framework based on reinforcement mechanism design to determine the optimal charging price in a mechanism design setting, which can optimize the long-term revenue of charging stations as well as the social welfare of users with private utility functions. Specifically, the strategic interaction between the station and users is modelled as a discrete finite Markov decision process, a Q-learning-based dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed to explore how price affects users' demands over a sequence of time. The experiments demonstrate that our pricing mechanism outperforms the predetermined time-of-use pricing in maximizing the long-term revenue of the charging station.",2020
Artificial neural network for option pricing with and without asymptotic correction,"This paper proposes a mixed approach of asymptotic expansion (AE) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods for option pricing in order to improve computational speed, stability, and approximation accuracy. In practice, there is wide use of complex stochastic volatility models (SVMs) which can allow for skew and smile shapes. However, under these models, it is usually hard to obtain analytical solutions for options written on the asset price. AE can compute option prices and their sensitivities effectively, but it can usually only compute a finite sum of terms of the complete solution because, as the expansion order increases, both analytical and numerical calculations become tedious and messy and the computational cost grows exponentially. On the other hand, using ANN one can separate the pricing procedure into two steps: (1) approximating ANN that can be trained offline and (2) using the ANN predicted option price obtained online. The offline procedure has an extremely high-computational cost because it requires tens to hundreds of thousands of Monte Carlo (MC) or PDE numerical simulations in order to train several hidden layers and several dozens of nodes. Moreover, deep learning (DL) for option pricing shows unstable behaviour and poor quality because the sensitivity of the derivatives price with respect to the input often takes a bell-shape, which induces rapid changes in value. By combining the strong points and making up for the weak points of the two methods, our new approach offers the following improvements: (1) much less training data, layers, and nodes are required: (2) the offline training becomes more robust and the online predictions produce more stable and accurate results: and (3) it significantly speeds up the offline calculations.",2021
Option pricing with genetic algorithms: A second report,"The cross-fertilization between artificial intelligence and computational finance has resulted in some of the most active research areas in financial engineering. One direction is the application of machine learning techniques to pricing financial products, which is certainly one of the most complex issues in finance. In the literature, when the interest rate, the mean-rate of return and the volatility of the underlying asset follow general stochastic processes, the analytical selection is usually not available. Over the last two years, artificial neural nets have been applied to solve option pricing numerically. However, so far, there is no applications based on evolutionary computation in this area. In this paper, we shall illustrate how genetic algorithms (GAs), as an alternative to neural nets, can be potentially helpful in dealing with option pricing. In particular, we test the performance of basic genetic algorithms by using it to the determination of prices of European call options, whose exact solution is known from Black-Scholes option pricing theory. The solutions found by basic genetic algorithms are compared with the exact solution, and the performance of GAs is evaluated accordingly.",1997
An empirical comparison of transformed diffusion models for VIX and VIX futures,"Transformed diffusions (TDs) are nonlinear functions of continuous-time affine diffusion processes. Since they are flexible models with tractable analytic properties, financial modelling with TDs has become increasing popular in recent years. We first provide a formal classification of TD models into drift-driven, diffusion-driven, and distribution-driven according to their empirical emphases and specification strategies. Motivated by the stylized distributional features of VIX such as skewness and excess kurtosis, we then propose a pair of new distribution-driven TDs for modelling VIX dynamics and pricing VIX futures by directly incorporating such information into the specification of the transformation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation into the relative performance of the three classes of models against several empirically relevant criteria. Our focus is on the in-sample goodness-of-fit measure and the out-of-sample forecast accuracy for modelling VIX and pricing VIX futures, as well as the stock return predictability of the implied Variance Risk Premium. Our findings demonstrate that the newly proposed distribution-driven models have clear advantages over well-established alternatives in most of our exercises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Deep weighted Monte Carlo: a hybrid option pricing framework using neural networks,"Recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to compress high-dimensional implied volatility surfaces into a low dimensional representation. Although this method can be effectively used for pricing vanilla options, it does not provide any explicit information about the dynamics of the underlying asset. In our work we present an effective way to overcome this problem. We use a Weighted Monte Carlo approach to first generate paths from a simple a priori Brownian dynamics, and then calculate path weights to price options correctly. We develop and successfully train a neural network that is able to assign these weights directly from the latent space. Combining the encoder network of the VAE and this new weight assigner module, we are able to build a dynamic pricing framework which cleanses the volatility surface from irrelevant noise fluctuations, and then can price not just vanillas, but also exotic options on this idealized vol surface. This pricing method can provide relative value signals for option traders.Key findings of the paper: We confirmed the success of Variational Autoencoders in compressing volatility surfaces into low dimensional latent spaces in the swaption market.We successfully extracted the physically meaningful information from the latent representation of the market by translating the latent coordinates into weights of Monte Carlo paths.We developed a hybrid approach by combining Deep Learning and Weighted Monte Carlo that can price any type of option consistently with the latent model represented by the fully trained VAE.",2023
Investor sentiment and machine learning: Predicting the price of China's crude oil futures market,"Sentiment analysis technology has made it possible to precisely calculate the daily reactions and opin-ions of investors, which has been found to have a significant influence on financial asset pricing. Thus, in this study, we examine the impacts that predictive power investor sentiment has over the price of China's crude oil. We first constructed investor sentiment indexes of China's crude oil futures based on specific economic variables and comments found on one of the most active online financial forums. Then, five popular machine learning tools were utilized to generate predictions. According to our findings, the long short-term memory model combined with the composite sentiment index performed the best due to a lower rate of prediction errors and greater directional accuracy for time-series forecasting of one-day-ahead prices. In this way, this study could aid researchers to more effectively investigate the en-ergy sector which is rapidly changing and highly speculative in nature (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

MQLV: Optimal Policy of Money Management in Retail Banking with Q-Learning,"Reinforcement learning has become one of the best approach to train a computer game emulator capable of human level performance. In a reinforcement learning approach, an optimal value function is learned across a set of actions, or decisions, that leads to a set of states giving different rewards, with the objective to maximize the overall reward. A policy assigns to each state-action pairs an expected return. We call an optimal policy a policy for which the value function is optimal. QLBS, Q-Learner in the Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds, applies the reinforcement learning concepts, and noticeably, the popular Q-learning algorithm, to the financial stochastic model of Black, Scholes and Merton. It is, however, specifically optimized for the geometric Brownian motion and the vanilla options. Its range of application is, therefore, limited to vanilla option pricing within the financial markets. We propose MQLV, Modified Q-Learner for the Vasicek model, a new reinforcement learning approach that determines the optimal policy of money management based on the aggregated financial transactions of the clients. It unlocks new frontiers to establish personalized credit card limits or bank loan applications, targeting the retail banking industry. MQLV extends the simulation to mean reverting stochastic diffusion processes and it uses a digital function, a Heaviside step function expressed in its discrete form, to estimate the probability of a future event such as a payment default. In our experiments, we first show the similarities between a set of historical financial transactions and Vasicek generated transactions and, then, we underline the potential of MQLV on generated Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, MQLV is the first Q-learning Vasicek-based methodology addressing transparent decision making processes in retail banking.",2020
Stock Volatility Forecast Base on Comparative Learning and Autoencoder Framework,"Volatility is an important indicator of derivatives pricing, financial risk measurement, and market panic sentiment measurement. A reasonable prediction of volatility is of great significance to market participants and regulators. This article proposes a new volatility forecast model. We use comparative learning and autoencoders to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. Reduce the instability of financial data due to noise. And this article expands traditional machine learning research methods. The traditional model is compared with other deep learning models. Our model has made very competitive progress in accuracy and loss compared to other models.",2022
On the estimation of commodity market risk premium under price limits,"This paper extends the estimation of market risk premium under price limits in two important directions. The first is to provide estimates of systematic risk for Canadian commodities futures (western barley, canola, flaxseed, feed wheat) using a market portfolio based on a similar weighting scheme suggested by Marcus (1984). The second is to estimate systematic risk with the induction of price limits in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the deployment of a fuzzy regression method.",2004
Implied volatility parameterization based on a machine learning polynomial approach,"Implied volatility modeling is the future anticipation of price fluctuation and so has a crucial role in option pricing. Machine learning approach can be applied as a great tool to modeling implied volatility and predicting the corresponding future data working towards improving the validity of final outcomes. Usualy, the majority of traders and investors are willing to be encountered with a simple model which is easy to understand, so we provide a light method to reach the goal. In this paper, we propose a machine learning polynomial approach due to the smile shaped behavior of implied volatility and investigate it with a regularization penalty term to fit the Out-The-Money volatility data and we compare the result with the prominent counterpart SVI. Finally, the promising numerical results illustrate that the new proposed algorithm yields an implied volatility smile which is free from static arbitrage for Out-The-Money European call options most of the time and it outperforms SVI in prediction.",2018
A factor model for option returns,"Due to their short lifespans and migrating moneyness, options are notoriously difficult to study with the factor models commonly used to analyze the risk-return trade-off in other asset classes. Instrumented principal components analysis solves this problem by tracking contracts in terms of their pricing-relevant characteristics via time-varying latent factor loadings. We find that a model with three latent factors prices the cross-section of option returns and explains more than 85% of the variation in a panel of monthly S&P 500 option returns from 1996 to 2017. In particular, we show that the IPCA factors can be rationalized via an economically plausible three-factor model consisting of a level, slope and skew factor. Finally, out-of-sample trading strategies based on insights from the IPCA model have significant alpha over previously studied option strategies. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2022
Improved accuracy of an analytical approximation for option pricing under stochastic volatility models using deep learning techniques,"This paper addresses the challenge of pricing options under stochastic volatility (SV) models, where explicit formulae are often unavailable and parameter estimation requires extensive numerical simulations. Traditional approaches typically either rely on large volumes of historical (option) data (data-driven methods) or generate synthetic prices across wide parameter (model-driven methods). In both cases, the scale of data demands can be prohibitively We propose an alternative strategy that trains a neural network on the residuals between but approximate pricing formula and numerically generated option prices, rather than learning the full pricing function directly. Focusing on these smaller, smoother residuals notably reduces the complexity of the learning task and lowers data requirements. We further demonstrate theoretically that the Rademacher complexity of the residual function class is significantly smaller, thereby improving generalization with fewer samples. Numerical experiments on fast mean reverting SV models show that our residual-learning framework achieves accuracy comparable to baseline networks but uses only about one-tenth the training data. These findings highlight potential of residual-based neural approaches to deliver efficient, accurate pricing and facilitate practical calibration of advanced SV models.",2025
The Study on Option Pricing Based on Wiener-Itô Chaos Expansion and Generative Adversarial Networks,"The stochastic volatility model, for pricing complex financial products, adequately considers the skewness and smile shape of asset volatility. However, it is often challenging to obtain analytical solutions for options on asset prices under such models. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid approach for forecasting the prices of European options based on the Heston model, utilizing the Wiener-It & ocirc; chaos (WIC) expansion and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Firstly, a two-step approach is constructed based on the simulated annealing algorithm and trust region reflective algorithm to globally optimize the Heston model. Secondly, the WIC method is adopted to derive a closed-form approximate pricing formula for European call options under the mixed volatility model, which in turn yields an approximation of option prices under the Heston model. Thirdly, the GANs model, incorporating long short-term memory networks and multi-layer perceptrons, is utilized to train the residual term D, representing the difference between the actual option price and its asymptotic approximation, which substantially improves the forecasting model's accuracy and robustness. Empirical research on SSE 50 ETF options demonstrates that the proposed model achieves better results in terms of accuracy and stability. The empirical results of training the residual term D significantly outperform those of training the actual option price. Additionally, the adversarial game concept of the GANs model leads to significantly better forecast performance compared to other machine learning models.",2024
Empirical performance and asset pricing in hidden Markov models,"To improve the empirical performance of the Black-Scholes model, many alternative models have been proposed to address leptokurtic feature, volatility smile, and volatility clustering effects of the asset return distributions. However, analytical tractability remains a problem for most alternative models. In this article, we study a class of hidden Markov models including Markov switching models and stochastic volatility models, that can incorporate leptokurtic feature, volatility clustering effects, as well as provide analytical solutions to option pricing. We show that these models can generate long memory phenomena when the transition probabilities depend on the time scale. We also provide an explicit analytic formula for the arbitrage-free price of the European options under these models. The issues of statistical estimation and errors in option pricing are also discussed in the Markov switching models.",2003
Option pricing with non-Gaussian scaling and infinite-state switching volatility,"Volatility clustering, long-range dependence, and non-Gaussian scaling are stylized facts of financial assets dynamics. They are ignored in the Black & Scholes framework, but have a relevant impact on the pricing of options written on financial assets. Using a recent model for market dynamics which adequately captures the above stylized facts, we derive closed form equations for option pricing, obtaining the Black & Scholes as a special case. By applying our pricing equations to a major equity index option dataset, we show that inclusion of stylized features in financial modelling moves derivative prices about 30% closer to the market values without the need of calibrating models parameters on available derivative prices.

Developing an optimized artificial intelligence model for S&P 500 option pricing: A hybrid GARCH model,"In this paper, we propose two hybrid models to release some limitations and enhancement of the results. In this regard, three popular GARCH-type models are utilized for more accurate estimating of volatility, as the most important parameter for option pricing. Furthermore, the two non-parametric models based on Artificial Neural Networks and Neuro-Fuzzy Networks tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are proposed to price call options for the S&P 500 index. By comparing the results obtained using these models, we conclude that both Neural Network and Neuro-Fuzzy Network models outperform the Black-Scholes model.",2020
MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WITH BOOSTING REGRESSION FOR PRICING AMERICAN OPTION,"The Boosting Regression Monte Carlo (BRM) method is proposed to price American options. The boosting regression is more general and flexible than the regression method in the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method and it solves the overfitting problem of the regression method in LSM through the implementation of regularization techniques, which makes the BRM method become natural improvement of the LSM approach in American option pricing. The American option pricing results are compared between BRM and LSM in two situations when the dynamics of underlying stock price of the American option follow a geometric Brownian motion and a double exponential jump diffusion process. The results show the BRM method could discover better exercise strategy in American option pricing and give more accurate American option price.",2016
Valuing American Options by Weighted Least-squares Quasi-Monte Carlo,"American options pricing has the backward nature of iterative search feature. Based on the least-squares Monte Carlo(LSM), this paper employs Faure sequences and doubles the sample's number by antithetic variate method to decrease the variance of simulation. Then, underling assets are valued. Thus, weighted least-squares quasi-Monte Carlo (WLSQM) is proposed by weighted least-squares regression. Comparing the two methods with option value, standard error and computation cost, WLSQM is better than LSM, which validates WLSQM is efficient on pricing American options.",2008
Regime-based Implied Stochastic Volatility Model for Crypto Option Pricing,"The increasing adoption of Digital Assets (DAs), such as Bitcoin (BTC), raises the need for accurate option pricing models. Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overft historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into diferent volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.",2023
Learning the random variables in Monte Carlo simulations with stochastic gradient descent: Machine learning for parametric PDEs and financial derivative pricing,"In financial engineering, prices of financial products are computed approximately many times each trading day with (slightly) different parameters in each calculation. In many financial models such prices can be approximated by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To obtain a good approximation the MC sample size usually needs to be considerably large resulting in a long computing time to obtain a single approximation. A natural deep learning approach to reduce the computation time when new prices need to be calculated as quickly as possible would be to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the function which maps parameters of the model and of the financial product to the price of the financial product. However, empirically it turns out that this approach leads to approximations with unacceptably high errors, in particular when the error is measured in the L infinity-norm, and it seems that ANNs are not capable to closely approximate prices of financial products in dependence on the model and product parameters in real life applications. This is not entirely surprising given the high-dimensional nature of the problem and the fact that it has recently been proved for a large class of algorithms, including the deep learning approach outlined above, that such methods are in general not capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality for such approximation problems in the L infinity-norm. In this article we introduce a new numerical approximation strategy for parametric approximation problems including the parametric financial pricing problems described above and we illustrate by means of several numerical experiments that the introduced approximation strategy achieves a very high accuracy for a variety of high-dimensional parametric approximation problems, even in the L infinity-norm. A central aspect of the approximation strategy proposed in this article is to combine MC algorithms with machine learning techniques to, roughly speaking, learn the random variables (LRV) in MC simulations. In other words, we employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods not to train parameters of standard ANNs but instead to learn random variables appearing in MC approximations. In that sense, the proposed LRV strategy has strong links to Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods as well as to the field of algorithm learning. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that the LRV strategy might indeed be capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the L infinity-norm in several cases where the standard deep learning approach has been proven not to be able to do so. This is not a contradiction to the established lower bounds mentioned above because this new LRV strategy is outside of the class of algorithms for which lower bounds have been established in the scientific literature. The proposed LRV strategy is of general nature and not only restricted to the parametric financial pricing problems described above, but applicable to a large class of approximation problems. In this article we numerically test the LRV strategy in the case of the pricing of European call options in the Black-Scholes model with one underlying asset, in the case of the pricing of European worst-of basket put options in the Black-Scholes model with three underlying assets, in the case of the pricing of European average put options in the Black-Scholes model with three underlying assets and knock-in barriers, as well as in the case of stochastic Lorentz equations. For these examples the LRV strategy produces highly convincing numerical results when compared with standard MC simulations, QMC simulations using Sobol sequences, SGD-trained shallow ANNs, and SGD-trained deep ANNs.",2024
PRICING OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL AMERICAN OPTIONS BY NEURAL NETWORKS,"Pricing of American options in discrete time is considered, where the option is allowed to be based on several underlyings. It is assumed that the price processes of the underlyings are given Markov processes. We use the Monte Carlo approach to generate artificial sample paths of these price processes, and then we use the least squares neural networks regression estimates to estimate from this data the so-called continuation values, which are defined as mean values of the American options for given values of the underlyings at time t subject to the constraint that the options are not exercised at time t. Results concerning consistency and rate of convergence of the estimates are presented, and the pricing of American options is illustrated by simulated data.",2010
Deep reinforcement learning for option pricing and hedging under dynamic expectile risk measures,"Recently equal risk pricing, a framework for fair derivative pricing, was extended to consider dynamic risk measures. However, all current implementations either employ a static risk measure that violates time consistency, or are based on traditional dynamic programing solution schemes that are impracticable in problems with a large number of underlying assets (due to the curse of dimensionality) or with incomplete asset dynamics information. In this paper, we extend for the first time a famous off-policy deterministic actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (ACRL) algorithm to the problem of solving a risk averse Markov decision process that models risk using a time consistent recursive expectile risk measure. This new ACRL algorithm allows us to identify high quality time consistent hedging policies (and equal risk prices) for options, such as basket options, that cannot be handled using traditional methods, or in context where only historical trajectories of the underlying assets are available. Our numerical experiments, which involve both a simple vanilla option and a more exotic basket option, confirm that the new ACRL algorithm can produce (1) in simple environments, nearly optimal hedging policies, and highly accurate prices, simultaneously for a range of maturities (2) in complex environments, good quality policies and prices using reasonable amount of computing resources; and (3) overall, hedging strategies that actually outperform the strategies produced using static risk measures when the risk is evaluated at later points of time.",2023
Neural network empowered liquidity pricing in a two-price economy under conic finance settings,"In the article at hand neural networks are used to model liquidity in financial markets, under conic finance settings, in two different contexts. That is, on the one hand this paper illustrates how the use of neural networks within a two-price economy allows to obtain accurate pricing and Greeks of financial derivatives, enhancing computational performances compared to classical approaches such as (conic) Monte Carlo. The methodology proposed for this purpose is agnostic of the underlying valuation model, and it easily adapts to all models suitable for pricing in conic financial markets. On the other hand, this article also investigates the possibility of valuing contingent claims under conic assumptions, using local stochastic volatility models, where the local volatility is approximated by means of a (combination of) neural network(s). Moreover, we also show how it is possible to generate hybrid families of distortion functions to better fit the implied liquidity of the market, as well as we introduce a conic version of the SABR model, based on the Wang transform, that still allows for analytical bid and ask pricing formulae.",2024
MONTE CARLO METHOD FOR PRICING LOOKBACK TYPE OPTIONS IN LEVY MODELS,"We construct a universal Monte Carlo method for pricing the options whose payout function depends on the final position of the extremum of the Levy process. The proposed method is capable of evaluating the prices of floating and fixed strike lookback options not only at the initial time but also during the entire period when the current position of the Levy process may be different from its extremum. Our algorithm involves three stages: approximation of the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the extremum process, evaluation of its inversion, and simulation of the final position of the extremum of the Levy process. We obtain new approximate formulas for the c.d.f.'s of the supremum and infimum processes for Levy models via Wiener-Hopf factorization. We also describe the principles of developing a hybrid Monte Carlo method, which combines classical numerical methods for construction of the c.d.f. of the final position of the extremum process and machine learning methods for inverting the c.d.f. with the help of tensor neural networks. The efficiency of the universal Monte Carlo method for lookback option pricing is supported by numerical experiments.",2024
"Stock market uncertainty, volatility connectedness of financial institutions, and stock-bond return correlations","Whether stock market uncertainty has an influence on subsequent stock-bond return correlations is examined in this paper, with a particular focus on comparing information content of the proxies of stock market uncertainty among the 8VIX index, VIX futures, and the volatility connectedness index of US financial institutions. Our empirical evidence indicates that the volatility connectedness index of US financial institutions provides more information to explain the stock-bond return correlations than the VIX index and VIX futures prices for both linear and nonlinear models. The superior information content of the volatility connectedness index of US financial institutions is in support of intermediary asset pricing theory. Finally, the nonlinear regression analysis suggests that the negative stock-bond return correlations due to investor flight-to-safety become less pronounced when the stock market uncertainty measures are very high.",2020
Optimized radial basis function neural network for improving approximate dynamic programming in pricing high dimensional options,"Pricing American basket option is one of the essential problems in quantitative finance. The complexity of this type of option has motivated many practitioners and researchers to develop simulation-based methods. In this paper, we develop an optimized radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), which is optimally tuned by the particle swarm optimization algorithm to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) for pricing the American basket option. Additionally, for the scenario generation, a simulation-based technique using a copula-GARCH method and Extreme Value Theory is performed to tackle the nonlinearity of dependencies between variables. The prices obtained through the proposed approach compared with those ones achieved from pure RBFNN and ADP in different situations. This is also illustrated that the obtained prices of American basket option can outperform the results obtained through the RBFNN and ADP approaches in terms of the predefined fitness measures.",2018
Monte Carlo methods for pricing financial options,"Pricing financial options is amongst the most important and challenging problems in the modem financial industry. Except in the simplest cases, the prices of options do not have a simple closed form solution and efficient computational methods are needed to determine them. Monte Carlo methods have increasingly become a popular computational tool to price complex financial options, especially when the underlying space of assets has a large dimensionality, as the performance of other numerical methods typically suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality'. However, even Monte-Carlo techniques can be quite slow as the problem-size increases, motivating research in variance reduction techniques to increase the efficiency of the simulations. In this paper, we review some of the popular variance reduction techniques and their application to pricing options. We particularly focus on the recent Monte-Carlo techniques proposed to tackle the difficult problem of pricing American options. These include: regression-based methods, random tree methods and stochastic mesh methods. Further, we show how importance sampling, a popular variance reduction technique, may be combined with these methods to enhance their effectiveness. We also briefly review the evolving options market in India.",2005
Pricing European Currency Options with High-Frequency Data,"Technological innovation has changed the financial market significantly with the increasing application of high-frequency data in research and practice. This study examines the performance of intraday implied volatility (IV) in estimating currency options prices. Options quotations at a different trading time, such as the opening period, midday period and closing period of a trading day with one-month, two months' and three months' maturity, are employed to compute intraday IV for pricing currency options. We use the Mincer-Zarnowitz regression test to analyse the volatility forecast power of IV for three different forecast horizons (within a week, one week and one month). Intraday IV's capability in estimating currency options price is measured by the mean squared error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error measure. The empirical findings show that intraday IV is the key to accurately forecasting volatility and estimating currency options prices precisely. Moreover, IV at the closing period of the beginning of the week contains crucial information for options price estimation. Furthermore, the shorter maturity intraday IV is suitable for pricing options for a shorter horizon. In comparison, the intraday IV based on the longer maturity options subsumes appropriate information to price options with higher accuracy for the longer horizon. Our paper proposes a new approach to accurately pricing currency options using high-frequency data.",2022
A dynamic look-ahead Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing Bermudan options,"Under the assumption of no-arbitrage, the pricing of American and Bermudan options can be casted into optimal stopping problems. We propose a new adaptive simulation based algorithm for the numerical solution of optimal stopping problems in discrete time. Our approach is to recursively compute the so-called continuation values. They are defined as regression functions of the cash flow, which would occur over a series of subsequent time periods, if the approximated optimal exercise strategy is applied. We use nonparametric least squares regression estimates to approximate the continuation values from a set of sample paths which we simulate from the underlying stochastic process. The parameters of the regression estimates and the regression problems are chosen in a data-dependent manner. We present results concerning the consistency and rate of convergence of the new algorithm. Finally, we illustrate its performance by pricing high-dimensional Bermudan basket options with strangle-spread payoff based on the average. of the underlying assets.",2007
The role of higher moments in predicting China's oil futures volatility: Evidence from machine learning models,"This paper expands the emerging literature on volatility forecasting for China's oil market by exploring the predictive ability of higher-order moments (skewness, kurtosis, hyperskewness, and hyperkurtosis) based on high-frequency data. Our investigation is originally based on the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) framework, but considering the possible multicollinearity and nonlinearity, it is extended to various machine learning (ML) models and combination forecasting models. The results reveal that higher-order moments, including the two highest moments, always significantly improve predictive performance for the COVID-19 crisis. We further examine the interpretability of ML models and each factor's contribution to the prediction, finding that odd and even moments contain short- and long-term prediction information, respectively. This paper also highlights the effectiveness of ML models for capturing trends in oil futures volatility with higher-order moments and the satisfactory performance of combination forecasting models. Finally, we investigate the predictability of asymmetric risk patterns and obtain identical results. Our study has important implications for financial risk management, asset pricing, and portfolio allocation.",2023
Sample Path Generation of the Stochastic Volatility CGMY Process and Its Application to Path-Dependent Option Pricing,"This paper proposes the sample path generation method for the stochastic volatility version of the CGMY process.

Moreover, we discuss path-dependent options, such as Asian and Barrier options.",2021
Empirical deep hedging,"Existing hedging strategies are typically based on specific financial models: either the strategies are directly based on a given option pricing model or stock price and volatility models are used indirectly by generating synthetic data on which an agent is trained with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we train an agent in a pure data-driven manner. Particularly, we do not need any specifications on volatility or jump dynamics but use large empirical intra-day data from actual stock and option markets. The agent is trained for the hedging of derivative securities using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with continuous actions. The training data consists of intra-day option price observations on S&P500 index over 6 years, and top of that, we use other data periods for validation and testing. We have two important empirical results. First, a DRL agent trained using synthetic data generated from a calibrated stochastic volatility model outperforms the classic Black-Scholes delta hedging strategy. Second, and more importantly, we find that a DRL agent, which is empirically trained directly using actual intra-day stock and option prices without the prior specification of the underlying volatility or jump processes, has superior performance compared with the use of synthetic data. This implies that DRL can capture the dynamics of S&P500 from the actual intra-day data and to self-learn how to hedge actual options efficiently.",2023
Stock Market Volatility and the Forecasting Performance of Stock Index Futures,"This study attempts to apply the general equilibrium model of stock index futures with both stochastic market volatility and stochastic interest rates to the TAIFEX and the SGX Taiwan stock index futures data, and compares the predictive power of the cost of carry and the general equilibrium models. This study also represents the first attempt to investigate which of the five volatility estimators can enhance the forecasting performance of the general equilibrium model. Additionally, the impact of the up-tick rule and other various explanatory factors on mispricing is also tested using a regression framework. Overall, the general equilibrium model outperforms the cost of carry model in forecasting prices of the TAIFEX and the SGX futures. This finding indicates that in the higher volatility of the Taiwan stock market incorporating stochastic market volatility into the pricing model helps in predicting the prices of these two futures. Furthermore, the comparison results of different volatility estimators Support the Conclusion that the power EWMA and the GARCH(1,1) estimators can enhance the forecasting performance of the general equilibrium model compared to the other estimators. Additionally, the relaxation of the up-tick rule helps reduce the degree of mispricing. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2009
Quantile information share,"This paper presents a new method to estimate Hasbrouck-type market information share in price discovery. The prevailing market information share is calculated on the basis of conditional mean. We propose a conditional quantile regression approach to obtain a new market information share measure, quantile information share, which varies across the combinations of different price quantiles. The method is illustrated with two data sets, one on the spot and futures markets in pricing S&P 500 equity index, and the other on price discovery for a cross-listed stock.",2019
Development of Demand Response Energy Management Optimization at Building and District Levels Using Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network Modelling Power Predictions,"Demand Response (DR) is a fundamental aspect of the smart grid concept, as it refers to the necessary open and transparent market framework linking energy costs to the actual grid operations. DR allows consumers to directly or indirectly participate in the markets where energy is being exchanged. One of the main challenges for engaging in DR is associated with the initial assessment of the potential rewards and risks under a given pricing scheme. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation model, using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) power predictions for day-ahead energy management at the building and district levels, is proposed. Individual building and building group analysis is conducted to evaluate ANN predictions and GA-generated solutions. ANN-based short term electric power forecasting is exploited in predicting day-ahead demand, and form a baseline scenario. GA optimisation is conducted to provide balanced load shifting and cost-of-energy solutions based on two alternate pricing schemes. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for assessing DR load shifting options based on a Time of Use pricing scheme. Through the analysis of the results, the practical benefits and limitations of the proposed approach are addressed.",2018
American option pricing: A classification Monte Carlo (CMC) approach,"This paper presents a method for pricing high dimensional Americanstyle options. This method is based on a combination of Monte Carlo simulation, dynamic programming and characterization of the early exercise boundary through recently developed classification methodology. The proposed algorithm grows linearly in the number of underlying assets of the option. Numerical examples for call options on the geometric average of several stocks are provided to illustrate the method.",2002
The valuation of arithmetic Asian options with mean reversion and jump clustering,"It is known that the prices of many commodities exhibit mean reversion and are subject to jumps. Particularly, there is mounting empirical evidence that suggests the existence of clustered jumps. In this paper, we consider the valuation problem of arithmetic Asian options under a Hawkes jump diffusion model which captures both the mean reversion and jump clustering phenomena. We compute option prices by means of characteristic functions and Fourier-cosine series expansion. Numerical studies justify the validity and efficiency of our pricing method, and demonstrate the nonnegligible effects of mean reversion and jump clustering on Asian option prices.",2024
On the Number of State Variables in Options Pricing,"In this paper, we investigate the methodological issue of determining the number of state variables required for options pricing. After showing the inadequacy of the principal component analysis approach, which is commonly used in the literature, we adopt a nonparametric regression technique with nonlinear principal components extracted from the implied volatilities of various moneyness and maturities as proxies for the transformed state variables. The methodology is applied to the prices of S&P 500 index options from the period 1996-2005. We find that, in addition to the index value itself, two state variables, approximated by the first two nonlinear principal components, are adequate for pricing the index options and fitting the data in both time series and cross sections.",2010
Does Size of Banks Really Matter? Evidence from Credit Default Swaps Market Data,"This study aims to discover whether markets take into account the phenomenon known as Too Big to Fail. Using Credit Default Swaps market data, which reflects the risk, markets attribute to banks, we calculate the default probabilities of banks over one, two, and three year periods. These results are then regressed with financial values such as total assets, total shareholders' equity and net income. Subsequently, the study is extended and the regression analysis repeated using Return on Assets as dependent variable. We find that markets place emphasis on profitability rather than size when pricing the riskiness of a bank. We conclude that the well-known concept of 'Too Big to Fail' cannot be considered as a concept with much validity, but the phrase 'Too Profitable to Fail' may provide a more accurate assessment of the situation.",2014
A knowledge based system for evaluation of option pricing algorithms,"In this paper we present the design and prototype implementation of a system built around the FINANZIA system that aims in the automated analysis and classification of option pricing algorithms based on experimental data. The main objective is to assist in the generation, storage, and evaluation of large amounts of experimental option pricing data and to facilitate the identification of performance properties of the pricing algorithms with respect to the various problems. The analysis of the data is achieved using statistical and inductive logic techniques and the identified properties are used to expand the knowledge base. We demonstrate the use of the system in the context of a case study covering the pricing of American vanilla options in a Black & Scholes modeling framework.",1998
Efficient Variance Reduction for American Call Options Using Symmetry Arguments,"Recently it was shown that the estimated American call prices obtained with regression and simulation based methods can be significantly improved on by using put-call symmetry. This paper extends these results and demonstrates that it is also possible to significantly reduce the variance of the estimated call price by applying variance reduction techniques to corresponding symmetric put options. First, by comparing performance for pairs of call and (symmetric) put options for which the solution coincides, our results show that efficiency gains from variance reduction methods are different for calls and symmetric puts. Second, control variates should always be used and is the most efficient method. Furthermore, since control variates is more effective for puts than calls, and since symmetric pricing already offers some variance reduction, we demonstrate that drastic reductions in the standard deviation of the estimated call price is obtained by combining all three variance reduction techniques in a symmetric pricing approach. This reduces the standard deviation by a factor of over 20 for long maturity call options on highly volatile assets. Finally, we show that our findings are not particular to using in-sample pricing but also hold when using an out-of-sample pricing approach.",2021
A novel recurrent neural network based prediction system for trading,"To reduce their exposure to price fluctuations in the markets, traders are increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities. There is thus a need to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions to capture the complex dynamics of price processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using a recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of commodities such as gold and currencies. The price predictions, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments show that the trading system can, when using the proposed network and strategy, form portfolios yielding a return on investment of nearly 5%.",2006
Deep Signature Algorithm for Multidimensional Path-Dependent Options,"In this work, we study the deep signature algorithms for path-dependent options. We extend the state-dependent FBSDEs with reflections to path-dependent FBSDEs with reflections, by adding the signature layer to the backward scheme. Our algorithm applies to both European and American type option pricing problems, while the payoff function depends on the whole paths of the underlying forward stock process. We prove the convergence analysis of our numerical algorithm with explicit dependence on the truncation order of the signature and the neural network approximation errors. Numerical examples for the algorithm are provided, including Amerasian option under the Black-Scholes model, American option with a path-dependent geometric mean payoff function, and Shiryaev's optimal stopping problem.",2024
The effect of international energy market shocks on coal price of China based on the fuzzy integrated vector auto regression and error correction model,"From the perspective of external market shocks, this paper proposed fuzzy integrated vector auto regression (FVAR) model that determines the long-term basis and short-term basis interactions of China's coal price with international energy prices. The proposed FVAR preform coal price fluctuation based on long-term and short term span in six stages including unit root testing, Johansen cointegration test, vector auto regression (VAR) model construction, fuzzification of VAR model, vector error correction (VEC) model and an impulse response function(IRF). It is observed that there is a steady long-term stability and equilibrium bond between the China's domestic coal price, international coal price and the international crude (unrefined) oil price. The international coal and international crude oil price have an opposite effect on China's domestic coal price. In addition, the former has a stronger fuzzy price discovery function on China's domestic coal market than the latter. In the short term, China's domestic coal price is more complex to instability reactions and is affected by market expectations. The international energy market is more effective than domestic coal market, and there is a relatively stable price adjustment mechanism between the two, with the international coal price playing a leading role in the fuzzy guidance of China's coal price. Therefore, in reference to international energy pricing models, the paper proposes a fuzzy pricing model for a coal futures index based on the coal futures trading price and supplemented by the premium and discount agreed to by both trading parties.",2021
Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach,"We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly scalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional approaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or assumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from the need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from market data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the models leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels of transaction costs.",2024
An improved least squares Monte Carlo valuation method based on heteroscedasticity,"Longstaff-Schwartz's least squares Monte Carlo method is one of the most applied numerical methods for pricing American-style derivatives. We examine the algorithms regression step, demonstrating that the OLS regression is not the best linear unbiased estimator because of heteroscedasticity. We prove the existence of heteroscedasticity for single-asset and multi-asset payoffs numerically and theoretically, and propose weighted-least squares MC valuation method to correct for it. An extensive numerical study shows that the proposed method produces significantly smaller pricing bias than the Longstaff-Schwartz method under several well-known price dynamics. An empirical pricing exercise using market data confirms the advantages of the improved method. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017
Are returns of copper futures in London metal exchange chaotic and long-memory? An empirical analysis with close returns test,"The volatility of returns in financial market is complex, which is often considered as a sort of nonlinear stochastic process or even chaotic process, but little attention has been paid to survey the price behavior in future market. Trying to describe the nature of return behavior correctly is one of the most important tasks in financial engineering and application, which is the basis of financial modeling, risk management, asset pricing and so on. In this paper we apply a new test, close returns test, to detect chaotic phenomenon of return of copper futures in London metal exchange. The results prove that the return series of three-month copper futures is weakly chaotic and exists complicated nonlinear dependence relationship, therefore for the long term modeling the return variation as a linear process (linear regression) or nonlinear process (GARCH, Stochastic Volatility) in econometrics may be improper to some degree. To explain and embrace the chaotic characteristic is a big challenge of financial modeling in future. We also use rescaled range (R/S) analysis to find the return of copper futures is positively persistent nonlinear process and present typical long memory effect.",2006
PRICING POWER EXCHANGE OPTIONS WITH HAWKES JUMP DIFFUSION PROCESSES,"In this article, we propose a jump diffusion framework to price the power exchange options. We model the price dynamics of assets using a Hawkes jump diffusion model with common factors to describe the correlated jump risk and clustering of asset price jumps. In the proposed model, the jumps, reflecting common systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk, are modeled by self-exciting Hawkes process with exponential decay. A pricing formula for valuation of power exchange option is obtained following the measure-change technique. Existing models in the literature are shown to be special cases of the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is given to illustrate the effect of jump risk and jump clustering on option prices. We observe that jump clustering significantly effects the option prices.",2021
A Domain Specific Approach to High Performance Heterogeneous Computing,"Users of heterogeneous computing systems face two problems: first, in understanding the trade-off relationships between the observable characteristics of their applications, such as latency and quality of the result, and second, how to exploit knowledge of these characteristics to allocate work to distributed computing platforms efficiently. A domain specific approach addresses both of these problems. By considering a subset of operations or functions, models of the observable characteristics or domain metrics may be formulated in advance, and populated at run-time for task instances. These metric models can then be used to express the allocation of work as a constrained integer program. These claims are illustrated using the domain of derivatives pricing in computational finance, with the domain metrics of workload latency and pricing accuracy. For a large, varied workload of 128 Black-Scholes and Heston model-based option pricing tasks, running upon a diverse array of 16 Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs platforms, predictions made by models of both the makespan and accuracy are generally within 10 percent of the run-time performance. When these models are used as inputs to machine learning and MILP-based workload allocation approaches, a latency improvement of up to 24 and 270 times over the heuristic approach is seen.",2017
Computing Black Scholes with Uncertain Volatility-A Machine Learning Approach,"In financial mathematics, it is a typical approach to approximate financial markets operating in discrete time by continuous-time models such as the Black Scholes model. Fitting this model gives rise to difficulties due to the discrete nature of market data. We thus model the pricing process of financial derivatives by the Black Scholes equation, where the volatility is a function of a finite number of random variables. This reflects an influence of uncertain factors when determining volatility. The aim is to quantify the effect of this uncertainty when computing the price of derivatives. Our underlying method is the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method in order to numerically compute the uncertainty of the solution by the stochastic Galerkin approach and a finite difference method. We present an efficient numerical variation of this method, which is based on a machine learning technique, the so-called Bi-Fidelity approach. This is illustrated with numerical examples.",2022
Reinforcement Learning- and Option-Jointed Modeling for Cross-Market and Cross-Time Trading of Generators in Electricity and Carbon Markets,"With the development of the carbon markets (CMs) and electricity markets (EMs), discrepancies in prices between the two markets and between two time periods offer profit opportunities for generation companies (GenCos). Motivated by the carbon option and Black-Scholes (B-S) model, GenCos are given the right but not the obligation to trade carbon emission allowances (CEAs) and use instruments to hedge against price risks. To model the strategic behaviors of GenCos that capitalize on these cross-market and cross-time opportunities, a multi-market trading strategy that incorporates option-jointed daily trading and reinforcement learning-jointed weekly continuous trading are modeled. The daily trading is built with a bi-level structure, where a profit-oriented bidding model that jointly considers both the optimal CEA holding shares and the best bidding curves is developed at the upper level. At the lower level, in addition to market clearing models of the day-ahead EM and auction-based CM, a B-S model that considers carbon trading asynchronism and option pricing is constructed. Then, by expanding the daily trading, the weekly continuous trading is modeled and solved using reinforcement learning. Binary expansion and strike-to-spot price ratio are utilized to address the nonlinearity. Finally, case studies on an IEEE 30-bus system are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed trading strategy. Results show that the proposed trading strategy can increase GenCo profits by influencing market prices and leveraging carbon options.",2025
"An enhanced ride sharing model based on human characteristics, machine learning recommender system, and user threshold time","The ubiquitous availability of the Internet and advanced computing systems has resulted in the rapid development of smart cities. From connected devices to live vehicle tracking, technology is taking the field of transportation to a new level. An essential part of the transportation domain in mart cities is to share vehicles. Sharing vehicles is an impeccable solution to issues like vehicle congestion, pollution, and the rapid consumption of fuel. Even though carpooling has several benefits, currently, the usage is significantly low due to social barriers, long rider waiting time, and unfair pricing models. Considering these issues, we have designed an enhanced vehicle-sharing model with two matching layers. The first layer matches riders based on similar characteristics, and the second layer provides matching options to riders and drivers to restrict the waiting time by using personalized threshold time. At the end of trips, feedback is collected from users according to five characteristics. Then, the two main characteristics that are the most important to riders are determined based on the collected feedback. The characteristics and classifiers are fed to our machine-learning classification module. For new users, the module predicts riders' characteristics, which allows riders to be matched to riders with similar characteristics. We have carried out an extensive simulation and measured the efficiency of the matching model while comparing the results with and without machine learning algorithms. In the simulation, we have used real-time New York City Cab traffic data with real-traffic conditions by using Google Maps APIs. Results indicate that the proposed model is feasible and efficient as the number of riders increases while maintaining threshold time for riders. Our proposed model and obtained results will help service providers to increase the usage of carpooling, and implicitly preserve natural resources and improve environmental conditions.",2021
Power approximation for pricing American options,"American options are one of the most traded instruments in the financial markets. However, pricing them is challenging because of the early exercise possibility. We propose a robust pricing method based on nonlinear regression over a representative set of exact pricing instances obtained via a binomial lattice. Our power approximation approach is inspired from the literature on the well-known (s,S)$(s,S)$ periodic review inventory system. Our objective is to develop a closed-form approximation for pricing American options that performs well on accuracy, computational efficiency (speed), and simplicity. Our results include developing a large set of exact American option premiums and critical stock price (indicating when to exercise the option) over a carefully designed grid with parameter values, which are common in practice. In addition, we compile the literature for existing American option pricing approximations and identify suitable ones. These approximations serve two purposes: (i) providing a starting point for our approximations and (ii) developing a benchmark for our work. We develop two closed-form approximations for the critical stock price, and premium of an American put option, which perform very well with a median error below 0.45% for both.",2024
Approximate pricing formula to capture leverage effect and stochastic volatility of a financial asset,"In this paper we investigate, since both, the theoretical and the empirical point of view, the pricing of European call options under a hybrid CEV-Heston model. CEV-Heston model captures two typical behaviors of financial assets: (i) the leverage effect and (ii) the stochastic volatility. We prove theoretically that the CEV-Heston model covers the leverage-effect and show empirically the volatility clustering property. Then, we utilize a decomposition of the option price to get an approximate formula for European call options. The accuracy of this estimate is compared with the Monte Carlo method. The results show the efficiency of our approximate formula.",2022
The Options Relations in DG Integrated Power System Classification and Pricing,"The distributed generation (DG) acts an important role in the reliability of electric power system. In power market, with the rapid development of DG in recent years, it is necessary to discern and calculate the value of possible economic contract between the DG and the integrated main power grid, in which the DG and the main grid serve as reserve capacity for each other. The problem of possible options trading relations and relative pricing model as well as the calculation method of options value considering circumstances in primary electric power markets like china is mainly discussed in this article, together with an explanatory quantitative example. The important role of this trade relation in demand-side management (DSM) in power market is also discussed.",2008
Geometric Asian options: valuation and calibration with stochastic volatility,This paper studies continuously sampled geometric Asian options (GAO) in a stochastic volatility economy. The underlying asset price is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion with stochastic volatility driven by a mean-reverting process. Semi-analytical pricing formulae for GAO are derived in a fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility economy by the means of a perturbation method. The effects of stochastic volatility on averaging type options are examined. A unified regression approach is proposed to capture smiles of some geometric Asian options and European options in one shot.,2004
"Do Weather Derivatives Mitigate the Revenue Risk of Farmers?-The Case of Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, China","This research probes the potential of weather derivatives as tools for mitigating the variability of crop yields due to climatic uncertainties in China. Centered on Tongliao City in Inner Mongolia, the study exploits a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to dissect and simulate 32 years of local precipitation data, thereby achieving a simulation of high reliability. Further exploration through a multiple linear regression model confirms a marked positive relationship between rainfall amounts and maize yields. By combining precipitation put options and the total revenue function for farmers, mathematical derivations yield specific expressions for optimal trading quantities and risk hedging efficiency. The research findings show that, using an assumption of a maize price that is 3 CNY/kg, when farmers purchase around 6.22 precipitation put options they can achieve 67.9% risk hedging efficiency. This highlights the significant role of precipitation put options under specific conditions in reducing the risk of decreased maize yields due to reduced precipitation. However, in practical markets, variations in maize prices and the price change unit (lambda) are inevitable. Through further analysis, this study reveals that as these factors change, the optimal trading quantity and hedging efficiency also undergo varying degrees of adjustment. The investigation lays a theoretical groundwork for the practical application and empirical validation of weather derivatives within China's agrarian sector. However, the study underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to market dynamics to refine hedging strategies. Future decision making must integrate market fluctuations, and adopting transparent pricing mechanisms is critical for enhanced risk management and the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices.",2024
PRIMA plus plus : A Probabilistic Framework for User Choice Modelling With Small Data,"We face choice problems every day, where we have to choose from options with multiple conflicting attributes, and learning a user's personal preference in choice problems is particularly important. For example, in E-commerce applications, this study may help make personal recommendations and sales prediction, and may offer important guidelines on sellers' pricing and discount strategies. Prior works either do not consider the competition among different options, or cannot handle the convex hull problem where a user selects an option that is regarded as unlikely to be the user's best choice by the models. Those supervised learning methods assume that a huge amount of data is available for training, while in reality, we may only have just a few records. In this work, we propose PRIMA++, a probabilistic framework that jointly considers the inter-attribute tradeoff and the inter-item competition, and a novel method to learn the user's personal preference from just a few past records. It can effectively address the convex hull problem and significantly improves the performance. We also borrow the concept of indifference curve from microeconomics and theoretically analyze a user's decision-making process and the competition among different available options. Real user test results show that our proposed framework can learn the user's preference from just a few records and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art works, especially when the data available for training are limited.",2021
Hedging of options in the presence of jump clustering,"This paper analyzes the efficiency of hedging strategies for stock options in the presence of jump clustering. In the proposed model, the asset is ruled by a jump-diffusion process, wherein the arrival of jumps is correlated to the amplitude of past shocks. This feature adds feedback effects and time heterogeneity to the initial jump diffusion. After a presentation of the main properties of the process, a numerical method for options pricing is proposed. Next, we develop four hedging policies, minimizing the variance of the final wealth. These strategies are based on first- and second-order approximations of option prices. The hedging instrument is either the underlying asset or another option. The performance of these hedges is measured by simulations for put and call options, with a model fitted to the Standard & Poor's 500.",2018
The Empirical Research on the Performance of Pricing based on TAIEX Options under Different Volatility Models,"This study introduces a variety of volatility estimation methods, including historical volatility, implied volatility and VIX, to assess and compare the performance of pricing TAIEX Options. The empirical results indicate that the evaluation performance of implied volatility model outperformed those of historical volatility and VIX models. In the analysis of causes of option's price errors by multiple variables regression, moneyness, time to maturity, volatility and index returns have significant impacts on the pricing errors, while trading volume and open interest do not have significant impacts on every pricing error. Even though the latter two factors are in the case of significance, their coefficients are negatively related to the absolute error.",2016
Pricing American-style options by Monte Carlo simulation: alternatives to ordinary least squares,"We investigate the performance of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method in Monte Carlo simulation algorithms for pricing American options. We compare OLS regression against several alternatives and find that OLS regression underperforms methods that penalize the size of coefficient estimates when the number of simulation paths is small. Based on our findings, we recommend an alternative method based on a modification of the matching projection pursuit that we introduce in this paper.",2014
A study of variance reduction techniques for American option pricing,"American option pricing is a challenging problem in financial mathematics for which several approaches have been proposed in the last few years. In this paper, we consider the regression-based method of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) to price these options, and then investigate the use of different variance reduction techniques to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo estimators thus obtained. The techniques considered have been shown to work well for European option pricing. One of them is importance sampling, in which the approach of Glasserman, Heidelberger, and Shahabuddin (1999) is applied to find an appropriate change of measure. We also consider control variates and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods, and use numerical experiments on American Asian call options to investigate the performance of these methods.",2005
Nonparametric state price density estimation using constrained least squares and the bootstrap,"The economic theory of option pricing imposes constraints on the structure of call functions and state price densities. Except in a few polar cases, it does not prescribe functional forms. This paper proposes a nonparametric estimator of option pricing models which incorporates various restrictions (such as monotonicity and convexity) within a single least squares procedure. The bootstrap is used to produce confidence intervals for the call function and its first two derivatives and to calibrate a residual regression test of shape constraints. We apply the techniques to option pricing data on the DAX. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2006
A TUTORIAL ON NESTED SIMULATION,"Nested simulation refers to the problem of estimating a functional of a conditional expectation that cannot be evaluated analytically and requires simulation. It finds a wide range of applications in operations research and machine learning, including portfolio risk measurement, pricing of complex derivatives, and Bayesian experimental design. Nested simulation typically proceeds at two levels. At the outer level, a number of scenarios are simulated. Then, at the inner level, given each scenario, one or multiple samples are simulated for estimating the conditional expectation. Various approaches have been proposed for estimating the conditional expectation and conducting nested simulation itself, focusing on point estimation and/or interval estimation, and addressing general or specified forms of the functional. In this tutorial, we review several approaches to nested simulation and discuss their contributions to the field.",2024
Spanning and derivative-security valuation,"This article provides the economic foundations for valuing derivative securities. In particular, it establishes how the characteristic function (of the future uncertainty) is basis augmenting and spans the payoff universe of most, if not all, derivative assets. From the characteristic function of the state-price density, it is possible to analytically price options on any arbitrary transformation of the underlying uncertainty. By differentiating (or translating) the characteristic function, limitless pricing and/or spanning opportunities can be designed. The strength and versatility of the methodology is inherent when valuing (1) average-interest options, (2) correlation options, and (3) discretely monitored knock-out options.

A Novel Bitcoin and Gold Prices Prediction Method Using an LSTM-P Neural Network Model,"As a result of the fast growth of financial technology and artificial intelligence around the world, quantitative algorithms are now being employed in many classic futures and stock trading, as well as hot digital currency trades, among other applications today. Using the historical price series of Bitcoin and gold from 9/11/2016 to 9/10/2021, we investigate an LSTM-P neural network model for predicting the values of Bitcoin and gold in this research. We first employ a noise reduction approach based on the wavelet transform to smooth the fluctuations of the price data, which has been shown to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, we apply a wavelet transform to diminish the influence of high-frequency noise components on prices. Third, in the price prediction model, we develop an optimized LSTM prediction model (LSPM-P) and train it using historical price data for gold and Bitcoin to make accurate predictions. As a consequence of our model, we have a high degree of accuracy when projecting future pricing. In addition, our LSTM-P model outperforms both the conventional LSTM models and other time series forecasting models in terms of accuracy and precision.",2022
A Simple Model of Correlated Defaults with Application to Repo Portfolios,"Credit risk exposure of a cash provider in a repo transaction is limited to 'double default events' when the counterparty and the issuer of the underlying collateral asset both default in a short period of time. This article presents a new and intuitive model for modeling correlated defaults, which are the key drivers of residual credit risk in repo portfolios. In the model, default times of counterparties and collateral issuers are determined by idiosyncratic and systematic factors, whereby a name defaults if it is struck by either factor for the first time. The novelty of the approach lies in representing systematic factors as increasing sequences of random variables. Such a setting allows us to precisely capture the clustering of defaults in time and build a rich dependence structure that is free of the flaws inherent in the Gaussian copula-based approaches still widely used for portfolio credit risk applications. Thanks to its general formulation, the model can be applied not only to repos, but also more broadly to pricing and risk-managing any default-correlation-sensitive instruments, e.g., credit default swaps, default swaptions, and CDOs.",2015
Testing hedges under the standard tranched credit pricing model,"We examine the performance of the standard tranched credit derivative (or synthetic collateralized debt obligation) pricing model over most of the lifetime of these derivatives. As the market for these derivatives is quite liquid, we focus on the application of the model for hedging, rather than for absolute pricing. We investigate first whether the standard model provides demonstrably better hedges than a simple linear regression, and second whether any of the typical variations on the standard model out perform the others. Our findings demonstrate that the standard model does produce better hedges than a simple benchmark, but that, within the numerous variations of the standard model, the simplest one is clearly the most consistent and reliable.",2009
Hedging of financial derivative contracts via Monte Carlo tree search,"The construction of replication strategies for the pricing and hedging of derivative contracts in incomplete markets is a key problem in financial engineering. We interpret this problem as a game with the world, where one player (the investor) bets on what will happen and the other player (the market) decides what will happen. Inspired by the success of the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in a variety of games and stochastic multiperiod planning problems, we introduce this algorithm as a method for replication in the presence of risk and market friction. Unlike modelfree reinforcement learning methods (such as Q-learning), MCTS makes explicit use of an environment model. The role of this model is taken by a market simulator, which is frequently adopted even in the training of model-free methods, but its use allows MCTS to plan for the consequences of decisions prior to the execution of actions. We conduct experiments with the AlphaZero variant of MCTS on toy examples of simple market models and derivatives with simple payoff structures. We show that MCTS is capable of maximizing the utility of the investor's terminal wealth in a setting where no external pricing information is available and rewards are granted only as a result of contractual cashflows. In this setting, we observe that MCTS hassuperior performance compared with the deep Q-network algorithm and comparable performance to deep-hedging methods.",2023
Enhancing customer-centric retailing through AI-driven total offer management strategies for airline users,"The new distribution capability has extended a new world of customer- centric total offer management strategies for airline users, where airlines must respond to each customer's booking instantly with a personalized set of offers and prices. Currently the process of creating offers is unrefined and is controlled by several organizations, procedures, and IT (Information Technology) systems. However, the present method is inadequate and the path to profitability lies in maintaining a continuous offer management system within an integrated total offer management framework. The extant research on customer-centric personalized offer management is lacking in terms of Total Offer Management systems (TOMs). The researchers primarily concentrated on creating a single offer along with a limited number of ancillary options, often neglecting to consider customer behavior in the process. This is where the deficiency in Total Offer Management Systems (TOMs) to the customers become evident. The current research introduces an innovative solution for addressing the total offer management problem outlined by (Wang KK, Wittman MD, Fiig T (2023) Dynamic offer creation for airline ancillaries using a Markov chain choice model. J Revenue Pricing Manag 22(2):103-121) and (Kummara MR, Guntreddy BR, Vega IG, Tai YH (2021) Dynamic pricing of ancillaries using machine learning: one step closer to full offer optimization. J Revenue Pricing Manag 20(6):646-653). This work advances existing knowledge by considering four different segments of customers, each associated with multiple ancillary options. In this research the proposed approach was compared with the existing algorithms in terms of purchase probability. The results obtained from the current work demonstrate a substantial 14.5% increase in the likelihood of offer purchases for each segment of customers.

Moving average options: Machine learning and Gauss-Hermite quadrature for a double non-Markovian problem,"Evaluating moving average options is a tough computational challenge for the energy and commodity market as the payoff of the option depends on the prices of a certain underlying observed on a moving window so, when a long window is considered, the pricing problem becomes high dimensional. We present an efficient method for pricing Bermudan style moving average options, based on Gaussian Process Regression and Gauss-Hermite quadrature, thus named GPR-GHQ. Specifically, the proposed algorithm proceeds backward in time and, at each time-step, the continuation value is computed only in a few points by using Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and then it is learned through Gaussian Process Regression. We test the proposed approach in the Black-Scholes model, where the GPR-GHQ method is made even more efficient by exploiting the positive homogeneity of the continuation value, which allows one to reduce the problem size. Positive homogeneity is also exploited to develop a binomial Markov chain, which is able to deal efficiently with medium-long windows. Secondly, we test GPR-GHQ in the ClewlowStrickland model, the reference framework for modeling prices of energy commodities. Then, we investigate the performance of the proposed method in the Heston model, which is a very popular model among the non-Gaussian ones. Finally, we consider a challenging problem which involves double non-Markovian feature, that is the rough-Bergomi model. In this case, the pricing problem is even harder since the whole history of the volatility process impacts the future distribution of the process. The manuscript includes a numerical investigation, which displays that GPR-GHQ is very accurate in pricing and computing the Greeks with respect to the Longstaff-Schwartz method and it is able to handle options with a very long window, thus overcoming the problem of high dimensionality.",2022
Kernel-based Monte Carlo simulation for American option pricing,"Valuation of an American option with Monte Carlo methods is one of the most important and difficult problems in pricing, since it involves the determination of optimal exercise timing in the sense that the option can be exercised at any time prior to its own maturity. Regression approaches have been widely used to price an American-style option approximately with Monte Carlo simulation. However, the conventional regression methods are very sensitive in the kind and the number of their basis functions, thereby affecting prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel-based Monte Carlo simulation algorithm to overcome such shortcomings of the regression approaches and conduct a simulation on some American options with promising results on its pricing accuracy.

A Simple Method of Forecasting Option Prices Based on Neural Networks,"Options are an important financial derivative for the investors to control their investment risks in the security markets. The forecasting activity should realistically identify the option price in the future without knowing underlying asset price in advance. In this paper, a simple method of forecasting option prices based on neural networks is presented. We modify the traditional option pricing methods, enabling them to be eligible for forecasting the option prices. Then we employ the neural networks to further decrease the forecasting errors of the modified conventional methods. Finally, the experimental studies are conducted on the data of the Hong Kong option market, and the results demonstrate that the neural networks are able to improve the forecasting performance considerably. Conclusively, our neural network methods on option forecasting are fairly effectual in practice.",2009
Are Derivative Warrants Overpriced?,"This study investigates the pricing efficiency of Hang Seng Index (HSI) derivative warrants in Hong Kong. Different from similar research, the study examines the pricing efficiency of index warrants by comparing their implied volatilities (IV) with realized volatility (RV). Although prior studies find that warrants are more expensive than the corresponding options, they are not necessarily overpriced in the conventional sensethat is, relative to the RV. This approach allows the study to test the pricing efficiency of warrants via a test of their information content. Moreover, unlike studies that focus on data at market close, the study uses a large sample of highly synchronous intraday, firm, bidask quote data to avoid possible distortions arising from intraday variations in liquidity and pricing in the instruments. The data also helps eliminate the potential nonsynchronous price problem that may affect the test results. Consistent with the results from previous studies, we find that warrants are often more expensive than options. This result is attributed to the inability of non-issuers to sell short, and the high participation rate of unsophisticated investors in the warrants market. However, regression analysis shows that IVs from ATM and OTM warrants provide unbiased volatility forecasts, and that IVs from ATM options do not subsume the information content of ATM warrants. ATM warrant prices are in line with the RV and are efficiently priced. Simulation results show that writing warrants is more profitable than writing options, and that the overpricing is directly related to the volatility premium.",2012
Statistical Learning of Lattice Option Pricing and Traders' Behavior Using Ising Spin Model for Asymmetric Information Transitions,"Financial fluctuations are one type of complex problem to determine the market behavior. The study of such fluctuations and statistical (machine) learning methods to predict the option price changes has been done by many researchers in the past. With the advancement in technology, one can capture the complexities in the financial systems and use of deep statistical (machine) learning, and apply unique set of rules and principles to these multi-layered complex networks. This paper provides a framework for lattice option pricing to determine the state for choice-sets, as one such unique set, in complex financial networks. This is largely based on human intelligence that learns features of each individual stock, and their trade-off, pay-off, preferential attachment and strategic options in the decision-making process. This paper also focuses on cases where both price and demand fluctuates stochastically and where both buyers and sellers have asymmetric information with limited time for high-quality decisions at their disposal to encourage or deter behavioral change. The situation draws on statistical mechanics and Ising-spin approaches to derive computational methods that infer and explain patterns and themes from high-dimensional data to manage the probable as well as lead the possibilities for multi-stage optimal control in dynamic systems.",2019
An options pricing method based on the atmospheric environmental health index: an example from SO2,"Environmental finance has gradually become an important tool for solving atmospheric pollution problems. The creation of options based on an atmospheric environmental health index (AEHI) is designed to support a rational pricing of financial products related to the health of the atmospheric environment. To begin with, the improved Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is established to predict the change in air pollutant concentrations, and then we construct the AEHI by using exposure-response Poisson regression model. In addition, an options pricing method for AEHI is proposed based on Esscher transform theory, and the universal investment strategy for enterprises is formulated to hedge operational risk by using the AEHI option. Finally, we use Beijing city of China, as a case study to demonstrate how to determine the AEHI options prices for two diseases in three age groups, and propose the investment strategy for an insurance enterprise. The AEHI options should therefore be used to compensate for the damage to human health caused by air pollution, and to hedge against the operational risks of related industries.",2021
Pricing currency options with support vector regression and stochastic volatility model with jumps,"This paper presents an efficient currency option pricing model based on support vector regression (SVR). This model focuses on selection of input variables of SVR. We apply stochastic volatility model with jumps to SVR in order to account for sudden big changes in exchange rate volatility. We use forward exchange rate as the input variable of SVR, since forward exchange rate takes interest rates of a basket of currencies into account. Therefore, the inputs of SVR will include moneyness (spot rate/strike price), forward exchange rate, volatility of the spot rate, domestic risk-free simple interest rate, and the time to maturity. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the ability of new model to improve forecast accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
A Multilevel Monte Carlo Method for the Valuation of Swing Options,"In this study, we propose a novel approach for the valuation of swing options. Swing options are a kind of American options with multiple exercise rights traded in energy markets. Longstaff and Schwartz have suggested a regression-based Monte Carlo method known as the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method to value American options. In this work, first we introduce the LSMC method for the pricing of swing options. Then, to achieve a desired accuracy for the price estimation, we combine the idea of LSMC with multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Finally, to illustrate the proper behavior of this combination, we conduct numerical results based on the Black-Scholes model. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",2021
A novel recurrent neural network-based prediction system for option trading and hedging,"In order to reduce their exposure to the erratic fluctuations of the financial markets, traders are nowadays increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities instead of directly trading in the underlying assets. This paradigm shift has attracted the attention of many researchers, and there has been a tremendous increase in the awareness and activities of derivative securities. In particular there is a need to devise new techniques to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions and approximations to capture the complex dynamics of pricing processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using an ad-hoc recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of war commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as currencies, which are increasingly gaining importance in the financial markets. The price predictions from the network, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments with actual gold and currency trading data show that our system using the proposed network and strategy can construct portfolios yielding a return on investment of about 4.76%.",2008
An Intelligent Learning and Ensembling Framework for Predicting Option Prices,"Estimating option prices and implied volatilities are critical for option risk management and trading. Common strategies in previous studies have relied on parametric models, including the stochastic volatility model (SV), jump-diffusion model (JD), and Black-Scholes model (BS). However, these models are built on several strict and idealistic assumptions, including lognormality and sample-path continuity. In addition, previous studies on option pricing mainly relied on its own market-level indicators without considering the effect of other concurrent options. To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent learning and ensembling framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the customized nonparametric learning approach is first utilized to estimate option prices. Second, several traditional parametric models are also applied to estimate these prices. The estimated prices are combined by a CNN to obtain the final estimations. Our experiments based on Chinese SSE 50 ETF options demonstrate that the proposed intelligent framework outperforms the traditional SV model, JD model, and BS model with at least 41.52% performance enhancement in terms of RMSE.",2021
Pricing and hedging long-term options,"Do long-term and short-term options contain differential information? If so, can long-term options better differentiate among alternative models? To answer these questions, we first demonstrate analytically that differences among alternative models usually may not surface when applied to short-term options, but do so when applied to longterm contracts. Using S&P 500 options and LEAPS, we find that short- and long-term contracts indeed contain different information. While the data suggest little gains from modeling stochastic interest rates or random jumps (beyond stochastic volatility) for pricing LEAPS, incorporating stochastic interest rates can nonetheless enhance hedging performance in certain cases involving long-term contracts.

Pricing of American options in discrete time using least squares estimates with complexity penalties,"Pricing of American options in discrete time is considered, where the option is allowed to be based on several underlying stocks. It is assumed that the price processes of the underlying stocks are given by Markov processes. We use the Monte Carlo approach to generate artificial sample paths of these price processes, and then we use nonparametric regression estimates to estimate from this data so-called continuation values, which are defined as mean values of the American option for given values of the underlying stocks at time t subject to the constraint that the option is not exercised at time t. As nonparametric regression estimates we use least squares estimates with complexity penalties, which include as special cases least squares spline estimates, least squares neural networks, smoothing splines and orthogonal series estimates. General results concerning rate of convergence are presented and applied to derive results for the special cases mentioned above. Furthermore the pricing of American options is illustrated by simulated data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2012
Valuing basket-spread options with default risk under Hawkes jump-diffusion processes,"In this paper, we investigate the pricing of basket-spread options with default risk under Hawkes jump-diffusion processes. A self-exciting Hawkes process is employed to describe jump clustering, and jump amplitudes of different assets in baskets are all correlated. In addition, the diffusive components of assets are also assumed to be correlated with each other. We obtain option prices by approximating the arithmetic average of the underlying assets in the basket with their second moment-matched geometric average values, and numerical experiments show that our approximated prices are quite accurate, spanning different underlying asset numbers and alternative strike prices. Finally, we illustrate the effects of default risk and clustered jump risk on the prices of basket-spread options.",2023
Parallel lattice implementation for option pricing under mixed state-dependent volatility models,"With the principal goal of developing an alternative, relatively simple and tractable pricing framework for accurately reproducing a market implied volatility surface, this paper presents two new asset price return models for option pricing and calibration. We consider a class of hidden Markov models based on Markov switching and a mixture model that embeds two diffusion processes whereby the underlying asset price dynamics obeys a mixed state-dependent non-linear volatility model. In particular, we study the so-called two-state mixture CEV diffusion model. Among possible nonlinear mixed state-dependent models, this proposed model offers a good balance between computational tractability and multiple parameter flexibility in the calibration process. The model also captures most of the empirical features such as leptokurtosis and volatility clustering of asset price returns. We present efficient higher order multinomial lattice methods for calibrating our model and for pricing European and American style equity options. Finally, we discuss two parallel algorithms for implementing the lattice methods: the shared memory and distributed memory algorithms.",2005
Option Pricing Model Biases: Bayesian and Markov Chain Monte Carlo Regression Analysis,"We investigate systematic and unsystematic option pricing biases in (a) pure jump Levy, (b) jump-diffusion, (c) stochastic volatility, and (d) GARCH models applied to the Black-Scholes-Merton model. We use options data for trades on the S&P500 index from the CBOE. In addition to standard ordinary least square regression, we employ Bayesian regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo regression to investigate the moneyness and maturity biases of the models. We demonstrate the usefulness of these advanced methodologies as compared to the benchmark techniques.",2021
Model Uncertainty and Pricing Performance in Option Valuation,"The objective of this article is to evaluate the performance of the option pricing model at the cross-sectional level. For that purpose, the authors propose a statistical framework, in which they in particular account for the uncertainty associated with the reported pricing performance. Instead of a single figure, the authors determine an entire probability distribution function for the loss function that is used to measure the performance of the option pricing model. This method enables them to visualize the effect of parameter uncertainty on the reported pricing performance. Using a data-driven approach, the authors confirm previous evidence that standard volatility models with clustering and leverage effects are sufficient for the option pricing purpose. In addition, they demonstrate that there is short-term persistence but long-term heterogeneity in cross-sectional option pricing information. This finding has two important implications. First, it justifies the practitioner's routine to refrain from time series approaches and instead estimate option pricing models on a cross section by cross section basis. Second, the long-term heterogeneity in option prices pinpoints the importance of measuring, comparing, and testing the option pricing model for each cross section separately. To the authors' knowledge no statistical testing framework has previously been applied to a single cross section of option prices. They propose a method that addresses that need. The proposed framework can be applied to a broad set of models and data. In the empirical part of the article, they show by means of example, an application that uses a discrete time volatility model on S&P 500 index options.",2019
Valuing three-asset barrier options and autocallable products via exit probabilities of Brownian bridge,"This paper discusses pricing barrier options and autocallable structured products on underlying three assets via exit probabilities of a three-dimensional Brownian bridge. We derive the marginal exit and bivariate co -exit probabilities. Despite the impossibility of finding an analytical trivariate co -exit probability, its calculation is not regarded as a purely numerical problem. After specifying the component to be numerically evaluated, logistic regression with the Monte Carlo method is adopted to predict it. Extensive numerical experiments of calculating the exit probability of the three-dimensional Brownian motion and pricing complex products demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",2024
Deep neural network framework based on backward stochastic differential equations for pricing and hedging American options in high dimensions,"We propose a deep neural network framework for computing prices and deltas of American options in high dimensions. The architecture of the framework is a sequence of neural networks, where each network learns the difference of the price functions between adjacent timesteps. We introduce the least squares residual of the associated backward stochastic differential equation as the loss function. Our proposed framework yields prices and deltas for the entire spacetime, not only at a given point (e.g.t = 0). The computational cost of the proposed approach is quadratic in dimension, which addresses the curse of dimensionality issue that state-of-the-art approaches suffer. Our numerical simulations demonstrate these contributions, and show that the proposed neural network framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in high dimensions.",2021
A quasi-analytical interpolation method for pricing American options under general multi-dimensional diffusion processes,"We present a quasi-analytical method for pricing multi-dimensional American options based on interpolating two arbitrage bounds, along the lines of Johnson in J Financ Quant Anal 18(1): 141-148 (1983). Our method allows for the close examination of the interpolation parameter on a rigorous theoretical footing instead of empirical regression. The method can be adapted to general diffusion processes as long as quick and accurate pricing methods exist for the corresponding European and perpetual American options. The American option price is shown to be approximately equal to an interpolation of two European option prices with the interpolation weight proportional to a perpetual American option. In the Black-Scholes model, our method achieves the same efficiency as the quadratic approximation of Barone-Adesi and Whaley in J Financ 42: 301-320 (1987), with our method being generally more accurate for out-of-the-money and long-maturity options. When applied to Heston's stochastic volatility model, our method is shown to be extremely efficient and fairly accurate.",2010
Energy price prediction based on decomposed price dynamics: A parallel neural network approach,"The growing uncertainties of the world due to geographic tensions, and weather conditions challenge the traditional method to achieve a reliable price prediction of energy future for both asset pricing and risk management. Following the initial success of deep learning models in energy price prediction, we attempt to establish a better architecture of neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy. We propose a novel Parallel Hybrid Neural Network (PHNN) model that utilizes independent sub-networks to effectively capture the distinct features of various sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the PHNN model exhibits a significant performance enhancement of 16.68%, 14.09%, and 2.34% over the EMD-LSTM, the informer model, and the single LSTM model, respectively. In particular, the PHNN outperforms the single LSTM, which is trained on the same inputs, by 2.34% overall while by a remarkable 4.11% during event periods. This suggests that the PHNN derives notable benefits from its distinct architecture, particularly during the initial phase of extreme events characterized by significant price trend changes. Additionally, the study explores the potential benefits of incorporating additional event-tracking indicators for energy futures price forecasting. However, the findings suggest that these indicators may not consistently provide effective complementary information.",2024
Potential formation mechanism and prediction of crude oil price based on underdetermined independent component analysis,"In most crude oil price prediction, a few of them explored the potential formation mechanism of oil price. This study proposes a novel multi-scale integrated (MSI) learning paradigm to mine the potential formation mechanism of the crude oil price and predict the crude oil price. Firstly, we propose a novel underdetermined independent component analysis (UICA) model based on extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) and independent component analysis (ICA) to study the potential formation mechanism of crude oil price. Based on the representative independent components (ICs), we found and analyzed some factors affecting the crude oil price from high frequency to low frequency, as well as the potential formation mechanism of crude oil price, such as geopolitical implications, natural disasters, historical pricing data and copper futures price. Moreover, the ICs are predicted and generated the final forecasting result of crude oil price via radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The experimental results based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price, confirm that the proposed MSI model is superior to the existing prediction models in terms of statistical and error performance criteria and Diebold-Mariano (DM) test with the optimal Dstat=99.0220, MAE=0.0050, RMSE=0.0537, MAPE=0.0116, ESD=0.0007, R2=0.9960.",2024
Pricing barrier options by a regime switching model,"This paper introduces a new way of estimating parameters in a Brownian motion regime switching asset model to incorporate volatility clustering. The regime switching model is then applied to pricing of up-and-in barrier call options. We take the probability of crossing the barrier between simulation points into account, and we increase accuracy in simulations by importance sampling. The regime switching model is compared to the Normal Inverse Gaussian model and the traditional Black-Scholes model, and option prices from the regime switching model are compared to the closed form expression of up-and-in barrier calls in a Black-Scholes market.",2011
Transpiling Python to Rust for Optimized Performance,"PYTHON has become the de facto programming language in machine learning and scientific computing, but high performance implementations are challenging to create especially for embedded systems with limited resources. We address the challenge of compiling and optimizing PYTHON source code for a low-level target by introducing RUST as an intermediate source code step. We show that pre-existing PYTHON implementations that depend on optimized libraries, such as NumPy, can be transpiled to RUST semi-automatically, with potential for further automation. We use two representative test cases, Black-Scholes for financial options pricing and robot trajectory optimization. The results show up to 12x speedup and 1.5x less memory use on PC, and the same performance but 4x less memory use on an ARM processor on PYNQ SoC FPGA. We also present a comprehensive list of factors for the process, to show the potential for fully automated transpilation. Our findings are generally applicable and can improve the performance of many PYTHON applications while keeping their easy programmability.",2020
Fuzzy Levy-GJR-GARCH American Option Pricing Model Based on an Infinite Pure Jump Process,"This paper focuses mainly on issues related to the pricing of American options under a fuzzy environment by taking into account the clustering of the underlying asset price volatility, leverage effect and stochastic jumps. By treating the volatility as a parabolic fuzzy number, we constructed a Levy-GJR-GARCH model based on an infinite pure jump process and combined the model with fuzzy simulation technology to perform numerical simulations based on the least squares Monte Carlo approach and the fuzzy binomial tree method. An empirical study was performed using American put option data from the Standard & Poor's 100 index. The findings are as follows: under a fuzzy environment, the result of the option valuation is more precise than the result under a clear environment, pricing simulations of short-term options have higher precision than those of medium- and long-term options, the least squares Monte Carlo approach yields more accurate valuation than the fuzzy binomial tree method, and the simulation effects of different Levy processes indicate that the NIG and CGMY models are superior to the VG model. Moreover, the option price increases as the time to expiration of options is extended and the exercise price increases, the membership function curve is asymmetric with an inclined left tendency, and the fuzzy interval narrows as the level set a and the exponent of membership function n increase. In addition, the results demonstrate that the quasi-random number and Brownian Bridge approaches can improve the convergence speed of the least squares Monte Carlo approach.",2018
"Dissecting E, S, and G for risk mitigation: insights from the term structure of CDS","In this study, we utilize a comprehensive dataset of US-traded credit default swaps (CDS) to assess the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) adoption on firm credit risk. Our study examines corporate bonds with key maturities from 0.5 to 30 years, covering data from 2007 to 2022. We apply fixed effects regression to analyse the impact of ESG scores on CDS spreads. The results are validated through a battery of robustness checks primarily the 2SLS method. The study finds that ESG scores, including the individual pillars, play a significant role in mitigating credit risk. The intriguing aspect of the finding is the decline in risk mitigation as the term-to-maturity increases. Further, the social pillar causes the highest sensitivity to credit risk, followed by the environmental and governance pillars. The effect of ESG adoption is slightly greater for subordinated bonds compared to senior tranches, however, the effects diverge for individual pillars. The study offers practical insights as understanding the relationship between sustainable practices and CDS term structure helps refine investment strategies and specifically pricing of credit risk.",2024
PATTERNS OF 50 ETF OPTIONS IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN CHINA: ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY FUNCTIONS,"The aim of this study is to examine the volatility smile based on the European options on Shanghai stock exchange 50 ETF. The data gives evidence of the existence of a well-known U-shaped implied volatility smile for the SSE 50 ETF options market in China. For those near-month options, the implied volatility smirk is also observed. And the implied volatility remains high for the short maturity and decreases as the maturity increases. The patterns of the implied volatility of SSE 50 ETF options indicate that in-the-money options and out-of-the-money options are more expensive relative to at-the-money options. This makes the use of at-the-money implied volatility for pricing out-of- or in-the-money options questionable. In order to investigate the implied volatility, the regression-based implied volatility functions model is considered employed to study the implied volatility in this study as this method is simple and easy to apply in practice. Several classical implied volatility functions are investigated in this paper to find whether some kind of implied volatility functions could lead to more accurate options pricing values. The potential determinants of implied volatility are the degree of moneyness and days left to expiration. The empirical work has been expressed by means of simple ordinary least squares framework. As the study shows, when valuing options, the results of using volatility functions are mixed. For far-month options, using atthe-money implied volatility performs better than other volatility functions in option valuation. For near-month options, the use of volatility functions can improve the valuation accuracy for deep in-the-money options or deep out-of-the-money options. However, no particular implied volatility function performs very well for options of all moneyness level and time to maturity.",2021
Option Pricing with Fractional Stochastic Volatilities and Jumps,"Empirical studies suggest that asset price fluctuations exhibit long memory, volatility smile, volatility clustering and asset prices present jump. To fit the above empirical characteristics of the market, this paper proposes a fractional stochastic volatility jump-diffusion model by combining two fractional stochastic volatilities with mixed-exponential jumps. The characteristic function of the log-return is expressed in terms of the solution of two-dimensional fractional Riccati equations of which closed-form solution does not exist. To obtain the explicit characteristic function, we approximate the pricing model by a semimartingale and convert fractional Riccati equations into a classic PDE. By the multi-dimensional Feynman-Kac theorem and the affine structure of the approximate model, we obtain the solution of the PDE with which the explicit characteristic function and its cumulants are derived. Based on the derived characteristic function and Fourier cosine series expansion, we obtain approximate European options prices. By differential evolution algorithm, we calibrate our approximate model and its two nested models to S & P 500 index options and obtain optimal parameter estimates of these models. Numerical results demonstrate the pricing method is fast and accurate. Empirical results demonstrate our approximate model fits the market best among the three models.",2023
Regression-Based Complexity Reduction of the Nested Monte Carlo Methods,In this paper we propose a novel dual regression-based approach for pricing American options. This approach reduces the complexity of the nested Monte Carlo method and has an especially simple form for time discretized diffusion processes. We analyze the complexity of the proposed approach in the case of both fixed and increasing numbers of exercise dates. The method is illustrated by several numerical examples.,2018
Interpretable State-Space Model of Urban Dynamics for Human-Machine Collaborative Transportation Planning,"Strategic Long-Range Transportation Planning (SLRTP) is pivotal in shaping prosperous, sustainable, and resilient urban futures. Existing SLRTP decision support tools predominantly serve forecasting and evaluative functions, leaving a gap in directly recommending optimal planning decisions. To bridge this gap, we propose an Interpretable State-Space Model (ISSM) that considers the dynamic interactions between transportation infrastructure and the broader urban system. The ISSM directly facilitates the development of optimal controllers and reinforcement learning (RL) agents for optimizing infrastructure investments and urban policies while still allowing human-user comprehension. We carefully examine the mathematical properties of our ISSM; specifically, we present the conditions under which our proposed ISSM is Markovian, and a unique and stable solution exists. Then, we apply an ISSM instance to a case study of the San Diego region of California, where a partially observable ISSM represents the urban environment. We also propose and train a Deep RL agent using the ISSM instance representing San Diego. The results show that the proposed ISSM approach, along with the well-trained RL agent, captures the impacts of coordinating the timing of infrastructure investments, environmental impact fees for new land development, and congestion pricing fees. The results also show that the proposed approach facilitates the development of prescriptive capabilities in SLRTP to foster economic growth and limit induced vehicle travel. We view the proposed ISSM approach as a substantial contribution that supports the use of artificial intelligence in urban planning, a domain where planning agencies need rigorous, transparent, and explainable models to justify their actions.",2025
Option pricing under a normal mixture distribution derived from the Markov tree model,"We examine a Markov tree (MT) model for option pricing in which the dynamics of the underlying asset are modeled by a non-IID process. We show that the discrete probability mass function of log returns generated by the tree is closely approximated by a continuous mixture of two normal distributions. Using this normal mixture distribution and risk-neutral pricing, we derive a closed-form expression for European call option prices. We also suggest a regression tree-based method for estimating three volatility parameters sigma, sigma(+), and sigma(-) required to apply the MT model. We apply the MT model to price call options on 89 non-dividend paying stocks from the S&P 500 index. For each stock symbol on a given day, we use the same parameters to price options across all strikes and expires. Comparing against the Black-Scholes model, we find that the MT model's prices are closer to market prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2012
Option pricing for stochastic volatility model with infinite activity Levy jumps,"The purpose of this paper is to apply the stochastic volatility model driven by infinite activity Levy processes to option pricing which displays infinite activity jumps behaviors and time varying volatility that is consistent with the phenomenon observed in underlying asset dynamics. We specially pay attention to three typical Levy processes that replace the compound Poisson jumps in Bates model, aiming to capture the leptokurtic feature in asset returns and volatility clustering effect in returns variance. By utilizing the analytical characteristic function and fast Fourier transform technique, the closed form formula of option pricing can be derived. The intelligent global optimization search algorithm called Differential Evolution is introduced into the above highly dimensional models for parameters calibration so as to improve the calibration quality of fitted option models. Finally, we perform empirical researches using both time series data and options data on financial markets to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

Analysis of Electricity Prices Volatility Based on Multicycle GARCH-M model,"The volatility of electricity price is the important information for the risk management of power markets and the pricing of power financial derivatives. A GARCH-M model in which the multi-cycle properties of electricity price series are described by dummy variable and sine function is proposed. The model is easy to select the order, and holds parsimonious scale of estimated parameters and high practical application value. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that the hetero-scedasticity and the load squares have a significant effect on the mean electricity price, and there exists volatility clustering.",2012
Lessons Learned in Developing and Applying Land Use Model Systems Parcel-Based Example,"A variety of land use models is driven by theoretical advances, data availability, enhanced computation, and new policy-making needs. This paper describes the process of developing and applying a disaggregate model system that seeks to simulate the subdivision and land use change of parcels and the spatial allocation of households and employment across zones. Relying on multinomial logit specifications, random number generation, and a seemingly unrelated regression model with both spatial lag and spatial error components, the model development process was accompanied by a variety of challenges. Some issues are specific to the model presented here, but many are common for integrated transport-land use models. It is hoped that solutions to these issues and lessons learned offer useful insights for ongoing improvements in land use modeling endeavors of all types. Comparisons of road pricing and trend scenario results for the Austin, Texas, region highlight how policies may shape land and travel futures. Although the road pricing policy did not alter land use intensity patterns in a significant way, it was forecast to increase speeds across the region's network and reduce regional congestion levels.",2009
Mean-Reverting Statistical Arbitrage Strategies in Crude Oil Markets,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of statistical arbitrage through the definition of a mean-reverting trading strategy that captures persistent anomalies in long-run relationships among assets. We model the statistical arbitrage proceeding in three steps: (1) to identify mispricings in the chosen market, (2) to test mean-reverting statistical arbitrage, and (3) to develop statistical arbitrage trading strategies. We empirically investigate the existence of statistical arbitrage opportunities in crude oil markets. In particular, we focus on long-term pricing relationships between the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures and a so-called statistical portfolio, composed by other two crude oils, Brent and Dubai. Firstly, the cointegration regression is used to track the persistent pricing equilibrium between the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price and the statistical portfolio value, and to identify mispricings between the two. Secondly, we verify that mispricing dynamics revert back to equilibrium with a predictable behaviour, and we exploit this stylized fact by applying the trading rules commonly used in equity markets to the crude oil market.

Interest rate risk in the banking book: A closed-form solution for non-maturity deposits,"I present an analytical valuation framework for the management of fixed-income instruments traded in imperfectly competitive markets, like demand deposits and credit card loans in the banking book, inter alia, to stabilize the abnormal profit margin. Banking book instruments contain embedded options such as withdrawal rights, discretionary pricing, rate clustering and zero-based floors. Analytical solutions speed up computation time to calculate valuations, earnings and risk measures like closed-form expressions for margin spreads, hedge ratios and parameter sensitivities. Asymptotically, according to martingale central limit theorems and thanks to the long-term nature of the banking book, Gaussian approximations can be applied. ? 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2021
"Pricing, Risk and Volatility in Subordinated Market Models","We consider several market models, where time is subordinated to a stochastic process. These models are based on various time changes in the Levy processes driving asset returns, or on fractional extensions of the diffusion equation; they were introduced to capture complex phenomena such as volatility clustering or long memory. After recalling recent results on option pricing in subordinated market models, we establish several analytical formulas for market sensitivities and portfolio performance in this class of models, and discuss some useful approximations when options are not far from the money. We also provide some tools for volatility modelling and delta hedging, as well as comparisons with numerical Fourier techniques.",2020
An efficient implementation of a least squares Monte Carlo method for valuing American-style options,"Several methods for valuing high-dimensional American-style options were proposed in the last years. Longstaff and Schwartz (LS) have suggested a regression-based Monte Carlo approach, namely the least squares Monte Carlo method. This article is devoted to an efficient implementation of this algorithm. First, we suggest a code for faster runs. Regression-based Monte Carlo methods are sensitive to the choice of basis functions for pricing high-dimensional American-style options and, like all Monte Carlo methods, to the underlying random number generator. For this reason, we secondly propose an optimal selection of basis functions and a random number generator to guarantee stable results. Our basis depends on the payoff of the high-dimensional option and consists of only three functions. We give a guideline for an efficient option price calculation of high-dimensional American-style options with the LS algorithm, and we test it in examples with up to 10 dimensions.",2009
Data Boundary and Data Pricing Based on the Shapley Value,"Data pricing is to price data as asset to promote the healthy development of data share, exchange, and reuse. However, the uncertain value index and neglection of interactivity lead to information asymmetry in the transaction process. A perfect data pricing system and a well-designed data market can widely promote data transactions. We take a three-agent data market in this paper, the data owner who provides the data record, the model buyer who is interested in buying machine learning (ML) model instances, and the broker who interacts between the data owner and the model buyer. Two interaction scenarios are defined. In scenario 1, we introduce the Shapley value (SV) to measure values of data records fairly and construct a revenue optimization problem based on the sum of the SV for data boundary. The optimal solution is obtained by calculating their derivatives. In scenario 2, we utilize market research and construct a revenue maximization (RM) problem to price the ML models. Further, An Integer Linear Programming for the RM problem (RM-ILP) process is proposed to transform the RM problem into an equivalent integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solve it with the Gurobi solver. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, which validate that the RM-ILP process can provide high revenue to the broker and high affordability to the model buyers compared to the benchmarks.",2022
Analysis of least squares regression estimates in case of additional errors in the variables,"Estimation of a regression function from independent and identical distributed data is considered. The L-2 error with integration with respect to the design measure is used as error criterion. Upper bounds on the L-2 error of least squares regression estimates are presented, which bound the error of the estimate in case that in the sample given to the estimate the values of the independent and the dependent variables are pertubated by some arbitrary procedure. The bounds are applied to analyze regression-based Monte Carlo methods for pricing American options in case of errors in modelling the price process. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011
Shape Constrained Regression in Sobolev Spaces with Application to Option Pricing,A class of nonparametric regression estimators based on penalized least squares over the sets of sufficiently smooth functions is elaborated. We impose additional shape constraint-isotonia-on the estimated regression curve and its derivatives. The problem of searching for the best fitting function in an infinite dimensional space is transformed into a finite dimensional optimization problem making this approach computationally feasible. The form and properties of the regression estimator in the Sobolev space are investigated. An application to option pricing is presented. The behavior of the estimator is improved by implementing an approximation of a covariance structure for the observed intraday option prices.,2017
A regression-based smoothing spline Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing American options in discrete time,"American options in discrete time can be priced by solving optimal stopping problems. This can be done by computing so-called continuation values, which we represent as regression functions defined recursively by using the continuation values of the next time step. We use Monte Carlo to generate data, and then we apply smoothing spline regression estimates to estimate the continuation values from these data. All parameters of the estimate are chosen data dependent. We present results concerning consistency and the estimates' rate of convergence.",2008
Simulation for American options: Regression now or regression later?,"Pricing American options requires solving an optimal stopping problem and therefore presents a challenge for simulation. This article investigates connections between a weighted Monte Carlo technique and regression-based methods for this problem. The weighted Monte Carlo technique is shown to be equivalent to a least-squares method in which option values are regressed at a later time than in other regression-based methods. This regression later technique is shown to have two attractive features: under appropriate conditions, (i) it results in less-dispersed estimates, and (ii) it provides a dual estimate (an upper bound) with modest additional effort. These features result, more generally, from using martingale regressors.",2004
Principled pasting: attaching tails to risk-neutral probability density functions recovered from option prices,"The popular 'curve-fitting' method of using option prices to construct an underlying asset's risk neutral probability density function (RND) first recovers the interior of the density and then attaches left and right tails. Typically, the tails are constructed so that values of the RND and risk neutral cumulative distribution function (RNCDF) from the interior and the tails match at the attachment points. We propose and demonstrate the feasibility of also requiring that the left and right tails accurately price the options with strikes at the attachment points. Our methodology produces a RND that provides superior pricing performance than earlier curve-fitting methods for both those options used in the construction of the RND and those that were not. We also demonstrate that Put-Call Parity complicates the classification of in and out of sample options.",2023
Multivariate Convex Regression with Adaptive Partitioning,"We propose a new, nonparametric method for multivariate regression subject to convexity or concavity constraints on the response function. Convexity constraints are common in economics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering and optimization, but there is currently no multivariate method that is stable and computationally feasible for more than a few thousand observations. We introduce convex adaptive partitioning (CAP), which creates a globally convex regression model from locally linear estimates fit on adaptively selected covariate partitions. CAP is a computationally efficient, consistent method for convex regression. We demonstrate empirical performance by comparing the performance of CAP to other shape-constrained and unconstrained regression methods for predicting weekly wages and value function approximation for pricing American basket options.",2013
"THRESHOLD LEVELS, STRIKE PRICE GRID, AND OTHER MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITY OPTIONS","This study addresses a number of important market microstructure issues associated with exchange-traded equity Options having significant research implications for Studies investigating clustering on option strike prices. Price threshold levels associated with exchange listing and the automatic exercise of equity options as established by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) to carry out their regulatory and oversight responsibilities are examined. Significant changes are documented including motivation for such changes. Market microstructure issues potentially impact equity Options research outcomes and one important issue is documenting changes over time to the strike price grid. A chronological outline of the introduction of option strike codes from April 26, 1973, through December 2008 is presented. Pricing discrepancies are documented between Standard & Poor's end-of-day updates (closing prices) and similar prices reported by Center for Research in Security Prices, Thompson, and Bloomberg, which is the source of ambiguities associated with the OCC's official settlement price. A number of quirks associated with option databases are identified to be of potential interest to researchers. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 30: 188-201, 2010",2010
Leave-one-out least squares Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing Bermudan options,"The least squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) is widely used for pricing Bermudan options. The LSM estimator contains undesirable look-ahead bias, and the conventional technique of avoiding it requires additional simulation paths. We present the leave-one-out LSM (LOOLSM) algorithm to eliminate look-ahead bias without doubling simulations. We also show that look-ahead bias is asymptotically proportional to the regressors-to-paths ratio. Our findings are demonstrated with several option examples in which the LSM algorithm overvalues the options. The LOOLSM method can be extended to other regression-based algorithms that improve the LSM method.",2024
Option Pricing via Breakeven Volatility,"The fair value of an option is given by breakeven volatility, the value of implied volatility that sets the profit and loss of a delta-hedged option to zero. We calculate breakeven volatility for 400,000 options on the S&P 500 and build a predictive model for these volatilities. A two-stage regression approach captures the majority of the observed variation. By providing a link between option characteristics and breakeven volatility, we establish a non-parametric approach to pricing options without the need to specify the underlying price process. We illustrate the economic value of our approach with a simulated trading strategy based on breakeven volatility predictions.",2023
"Fractional Black-Scholes option pricing, volatility calibration and implied Hurst exponents in South African context","Background: Contingent claims on underlying assets are typically priced under a framework that assumes, inter alia, that the log returns of the underlying asset are normally distributed. However, many researchers have shown that this assumption is violated in practice. Such violations include the statistical properties of heavy tails, volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and long memory. This paper considers the pricing of contingent claims when the underlying is assumed to display long memory, an issue that has heretofore not received much attention. Aim: We address several theoretical and practical issues in option pricing and implied volatility calibration in a fractional Black-Scholes market. We introduce a novel eight-parameter fractional Black-Scholes-inspired (FBSI) model for the implied volatility surface, and consider in depth the issue of calibration. One of the main benefits of such a model is that it allows one to decompose implied volatility into an independent long-memory component-captured by an implied Hurst exponent-and a conditional implied volatility component. Such a decomposition has useful applications in the areas of derivatives trading, risk management, delta hedging and dynamic asset allocation. Setting: The proposed FBSI volatility model is calibrated to South African equity index options data as well as South African Rand/American Dollar currency options data. However, given the focus on the theoretical development of the model, the results in this paper are applicable across all financial markets. Methods: The FBSI model essentially combines a deterministic function form of the 1-year implied volatility skew with a separate deterministic function for the implied Hurst exponent, thus allowing one to model both observed implied volatility surfaces as well as decompose them into independent volatility and long-memory components respectively. Calibration of the model makes use of a quasi-explicit weighted least-squares optimisation routine. Results: It is shown that a fractional Black-Scholes model always admits a non-constant implied volatility term structure when the Hurst exponent is not 0.5, and that 1-year implied volatility is independent of the Hurst exponent and equivalent to fractional volatility. Furthermore, we show that the FBSI model fits the equity index implied volatility data very well but that a more flexible Hurst exponent parameterisation is required to fit accurately the currency implied volatility data. Conclusion: The FBSI model is an arbitrage-free deterministic volatility model that can accurately model equity index implied volatility. It also provides one with an estimate of the implied Hurst exponent, which could be very useful in derivatives trading and delta hedging.",2017
Parallel pricing algorithms for multi-dimensional Bermudan/American options using Monte Carlo methods,"In this paper we present two parallel Monte Carlo based algorithms for pricing multi-dimensional Bermudan/American options. First approach relies on computation of the optimal exercise boundary while the second relies on classification of continuation and exercise values. We also evaluate the performance of both the algorithms in a desktop grid environment. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a heterogeneous computing environment, and identify scalability constraints due to the algorithmic structure. (C) 2010 IMACS.

On Correlation and Default Clustering in Credit Markets,"We establish Markovian models in the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1992) paradigm that permit an exponential affine representation of riskless and risky bond prices while offering significant flexibility in the choice of volatility structures. Estimating models in our family is typically no more difficult than in the workhorse affine family. Besides diffusive and jump-induced default correlations, defaults can impact the credit spreads of surviving firms, allowing for a greater clustering of defaults. Numerical implementations highlight the importance of incorporating interest rate credit spread correlations, credit spread impact factors, and the full credit spread curve when building a unified framework for pricing credit derivatives.

An agent-based FTR auction simulator,"In this paper, an agent-based simulation of a Financial Transmission Rights (FTR) auction for both types of point-to-point FTRs, obligation and option, is presented. Each auction participant is simulated as an adaptive agent who has the ability of evaluating its environment and acting accordingly, following the decision rules of the naive reinforcement learning algorithm presented in the paper. Initially, a Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) based ex-ante energy market is assumed. From the solution of the ex-ante energy market the agents calculate their initial FTR bid prices. Subsequently, the ISO solves the FTR auction problem and the agents profits equal the reimbursement they receive in the ex-post energy market for holding the FTR. The agent-based simulator repeats the FIR auction under the same conditions: in each repetition the agents update their bids according to the implemented algorithm and they learn their bidding strategies, through exploration by repetition. A five bus test system with five agents is used to illustrate the presented method. The results demonstrate the impact of contingency constraints and the effect of speculation in FIR auctions. Furthermore, the difference between bidding for FTR-obligations and FTR-options is shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011
House Prices Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques,"In places like Bangalore, developing predictive models for home selling prices is still a difficult and time-consuming job. The price at which houses in major cities are being sold as in bangalore is reliant on a variety of interconnected variables. The area of the house where you live may have a significant impact on the pricing. Property, including the physical location as well as the features and services on the property. Due to the fact that there has been research done and an analysis done by taking into account the data set that is still available to the general public using a machine to depict the various housing options platform for hack athons there are nine different variables in this collection of information. According to the findings of this investigation, attempts have been made to develop a model that can predict assessing the pricing in light of the influencing variables. Some regression methods, such as are used in modeling experiments, such the least squares method of multivariate linear regression, the lasso, and the ridge models of regression, support vector regression, and methods for enhancing such as extreme gradient boost regression (xg) methods; boost). These models are used in the construction of prediction models and in the analysis of decide on the most effective design by doing a comparison an examination of the disparity in prediction error between the two models.

Pricing Variable Annuity Contract with GMAB Guarantee Under a Regime Switching Local Volatility Model,"This article investigates the pricing of variable annuity guarantees, with particularly emphasising on the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB) with several embedded options, like roll-up and ratchet.

As local volatility pioneered by Deelstra and Ray & eacute;e (2013), on their proposed model by explicitly introducing the regime switching components into the local volatility. Model calibration and valuation are performed through the application of Monte Carlo simulations and Gaussian Process Regression methodologies. For the illustration of the capability of this model and some possible improvements in the model, a numerical and sensitivity analysis is conducted. Uses an empirical test on historical S&P500 Index data to illustrate its practical implications.

Turbo-Charging Deep Learning Methods for Partial Differential Equations,"Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a frequent necessity in numerous domains, ranging from complex systems simulation to financial derivatives pricing and continuous-time optimisation tasks. The challenging nature of PDEs, especially in high dimensions or cases involving non-linearities, calls for robust, innovative solutions. This paper leverages a deep neural network methodology, utilizing differential operators and boundary conditions in tandem with sampling techniques and minimising distinct loss terms. The role of physics-inspired neural networks in this approach is also highlighted. Our primary proposition is a Bayesian interpretation, where we address the issue as a hierarchical multi-objective optimisation problem augmented with adaptive sampling. We also introduce a concept of 'curriculum learning,' which parallels control variates, thereby facilitating further variance reduction and the re-utilisation of solutions derived from assorted problems. Our methods notably enhance the speed of convergence and diminish approximation errors. The effectiveness of our strategies is demonstrated through illustrative examples, solidifying their value in practical applications.",2023
Confidence in data mining model predictions: A financial engineering application,"This paper describes a generally applicable robust method for determining prediction intervals for models derived by non-linear regression. Hypothesis tests for bias are applied. The concept is demonstrated by application to a standard synthetic example, and is then applied to prediction intervals for a financial engineering example viz. option pricing using data from LIFFE for 'ESX' European style options on the FTSE 100 index. Unbiased estimates of the standard error are obtained. The method uses standard regression procedures to determine local error bars and avoids programming special architectures. It is appropriate for target data with non-constant variance.",2003
"Determinants of Commute Distance in South East Queensland, Australia: Implications for Usage-based Pricing in Lower-density Urban Settings","Usage-based road charges are expected to reduce the use of private vehicles. To assess this assumption, this study investigates the factors currently influencing commute distance in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. A multiple regression model was estimated to identify the significant determinants of commute distance, followed by a hierarchical regression analysis to ascertain the contribution of personal characteristics, household characteristics, work-related characteristics and accessibility. We conclude that many commuters would remain captive private vehicle usersuntil accessibility improves, and other transport modes offer viable commuting options. Alternatively, the pricing scheme should be adapted to suit local contexts.",2021
Interval fuzzy rule-based modeling approach for financial time series forecasting,"Financial interval time series (ITS) describe the evolution of the maximum and minimum prices of an asset throughout time, which can be related to the concept of volatility. Hence, their accurate forecasts play a key role in risk management, derivatives pricing and asset allocation, as well as supplements the information extracted by the time series of the closing price values. This paper proposes an interval fuzzy rule-based model (iFRB) for ITS forecasting. iFRB consists in a fuzzy rule-based approach with affine consequents, which provides a nonlinear method that processes interval-valued data. It is suggested as empirical application the prediction of the main index of the Brazilian stock market, the IBOVESPA. One-step-ahead interval forecasts are compared against traditional univariate and multivariate time series benchmarks and with an interval multilayer perceptron neural network in terms of accuracy metrics and statistical tests. The results indicate that iFRB provides accurate forecasts and appears as a potential tool for financial ITS forecasting.",2017

A Forward Monte Carlo Method for American Options Pricing,"This study proposes a forward Monte Carlo method for the pricing of American options. The main advantage of this method is that it does not use backward induction as required by other methods. Instead, the proposed approach relies on a wise determination about whether a simulated stock price has entered the exercise region. The validity of the proposed method is supported by the mathematical proofs for the vanilla cases. With some adaption, it is shown that this forward method can be extended to price other American style options such as chooser and exchange options. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a series of numerical examples, revealing significant improvements in numerical efficiency and accuracy in contrast with the standard regression-based method of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001).

Economic evaluation of grazing steers on summer annuals sod-seeded into warm-season perennial pasture,"Objectives: Sorhgum-sudangrass (SS) and cowpea (CW) can increase cattle gains when sod-seeded to mixed bermudagrass (MB); however, establishment time and cost may not be recouped by improved animal production. Additionally, valuing weight gain at varying production stages, without a market transaction, prompted an evaluation of different pricing methods. Materials and Methods: Cattle gains on MB, SS, and a 50:50 mix of SS+CW (SSCW) pastures were evaluated. One pricing method linearly interpolated 10-yr-average prices across weight categories. A second, regression-based approach added corn and feeder cattle futures to weight to explain prices. The third used experimental years only. Results and Discussion: Greater forage quality in annuals pastures where cattle had greater ADG (1.01 kg/ head per day for SS and SSCW vs. 0.79 kg/head per day for MB) led to different cattle gains by forage and year. In 2021 grazing days were 91, 68, and 60 d for MB, SS, and SSCW, respectively, whereas they were 95 d for MB and 92 d for SS and SSCW in 2022. Despite greater ADG with annuals, delayed planting of annuals led to numerically lesser cattle gains and lesser partial returns than MB in 2021. In 2022 drought forced a rest period in MB pastures; however, greater weight gains with annuals did not recoup costs regardless of pricing method. Conclusions and Applications: Timely planting is important for increasing grazing days with annuals. With seasonal and cyclical dynamics affecting the value of weight gain, heavier ending weights were not rewarded with prices that would cover annuals establishment.",2024
On the primal-dual algorithm for callable Bermudan options,"This paper discusses various extensions and implementation aspects of the primal-dual algorithm of Andersen and Broadie for the pricing of Bermudan options. The main emphasis is on a generalization of the dual lower and upper bounds to the case of mixed buyer and seller exercise, along with a detailed analysis of the sharpness of the bounds. As it turns out, the method as well as the convergence analysis can even be extended to conditional exercise rights and autotrigger strategies. These theoretical results are accompanied by a detailed description of the algorithmic implementation, including a robust regression method and the choice of suitable basis functions. Detailed numerical examples show that the algorithm leads to surprisingly tight bounds even for the case of high-dimensional callable Bermudan pricing problems.",2013
State-level trends in renewable energy procurement via solar installation versus green electricity,"In recent years, options for procuring renewable energy have increased, ranging from rooftop solar installation to utility green pricing to Community Choice Aggregation. These options vary in terms of costs and benefits to the consumer as well as grid integration implications. However, little is known regarding how the presence of a wide range of voluntary utility-scale renewable procurement options as well as their growth could affect adoption of distributed residential solar. To examine this relationship, we fit a two-stage least squares random effects regression model on panel data from 2016 to 2019 for all fifty US states plus the District of Columbia, controlling for variables that measure state-level policies, economic factors, and resource availability. Although there was no evidence of a strong relationship between demand for utility-scale and distributed options across all states, the state-level correlations suggest a wide variation between states including a positive, zero or negative relationship between utility-scale and distributed generation.",2023
A classification framework for carbon tax revenue use,"Carbon pricing could assist in the dual pursuit of mitigating global climate change and contributing to government coffers. The way in which a government allocates carbon tax revenues is a key factor in the public's acceptance of carbon pricing policy and ultimately in its enduring success. To that end, this article presents an innovative, simple classification framework of carbon tax revenue usage which has four modalities to cater for various policy design features. These are: a constrained approach as opposed to an unconstrained one; a revenue-neutral recycling approach as opposed to a revenue-raising one; an approach according to public preference; and a thematic approach. Thereafter, various attributes are examined to assist policymakers in selecting an appropriate modality. The classification framework will be useful for policymakers as a quick point of reference before embarking on more complex and in-depth policy deliberations. Key policy insights Carbon pricing is the most cost-effective regulatory approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is recognized as a significant contributor to government revenue. Carbon tax revenue use can be classified into four overarching modalities to cater for various policy design attributes. There is no dominating revenue use option from an economic or political viewpoint, owing to trade-offs across various fiscal policy objectives. Carbon taxes are elements of broader tax reform and therefore revenue use options should be aligned with a jurisdiction's broader fiscal policy charter.",2021
Financial reporting for employee stock options: liabilities or equity?,"This study seeks to determine whether employee stock options share key characteristics of liabilities or equity. Consistent with warrant pricing theory, we find that common equity risk and expected return are negatively associated with the extent to which a firm has outstanding employee stock options, which is opposite to the association for liabilities. We also find the following. (1) The association is positive for firms that reprice options and less negative for firms that have options with longer remaining terms to maturity, which indicates that some employee stock options have characteristics that make them more similar to liabilities. (2) Leverage measured based on treating options as equity has a stronger positive relation with common equity risk than leverage measured based on treating options as liabilities. (3) The sensitivity of employee stock option value to changes in asset value mirrors that of common equity value and is opposite to that of liability value. Also, we find that, unlike liabilities, employee stock options have substantially higher risk and expected return than common equity. Our findings are not consistent with classifying employee stock options as liabilities for financial reporting if classification were based on the directional association of a claim with common equity risk and expected return. Rather, our findings suggest the options act more like another type of equity.",2013
"Bounds Pricing Method of Currency Options Based on Triangular Fuzzy Numbers, Fuzzy Programming and Fuzzy Regression","Some financial variables can always be observed with perturbations and be expected in the imprecise sense because of the fluctuation of financial markets. Therefore, this paper introduces fuzzy techniques, and gives a fuzzy currency options bounds pricing model. By denoting four input variables in the Garman-Kohlhagen model as triangular fuzzy numbers, the currency option price will turn into a fuzzy number. In order to construct easily the membership function of this fuzzy number, a triangular fuzzy number is used to approximate it. Then a fuzzy programming procedure is proposed to determine its lower bound and upper bound. Finally, the proposed fuzzy currency options bounds pricing model is tested with the daily market data of the EUR/USD currency option. The empirical study results indicate that the proposed method is a useful tool for modelling the imprecise problems in the foreign exchange derivative markets.",2009
Pricing derivatives on graphics processing units using Monte Carlo simulation,"This paper is about using the existing Monte Carlo approach for pricing European and American contracts on a state-of-the-art graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. First, we adapt on a cluster of GPUs two different suitable paradigms of parallelizing random number generators, which were developed for CPU clusters. Because in financial applications, we request results within seconds of simulation, the sufficiently large computations should be implemented on a cluster of machines. Thus, we make the European contract comparison between CPUs and GPUs using from one up to 16 nodes of a CPU/GPU cluster. We show that using GPUs for European contracts reduces the execution time by approximate to 40 and diminishes the energy consumed by approximate to 50 during the simulation. In the second set of experiments, we investigate the benefits of using GPUs' parallelization for pricing American options that require solving an optimal stopping problem and which we implement using the Longstaff and Schwartz regression method. The speedup result obtained for American options varies between two and 10 according to the number of generated paths, the dimensions, and the time discretization.

Pricing American interest rate options under the jump-extended constant-elasticity-of-variance short rate models,"This paper demonstrates how to value American interest rate options under the jump-extended constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) models. We consider both exponential jumps (see Duffle et al., 2000) and log-normal jumps (see Johannes, 2004) in the short rate process. We show how to superimpose recombining multinomial jump trees on the diffusion trees, creating mixed jump-diffusion trees for the CEV models of short rate extended with exponential and lognormal jumps. Our simulations for the special case of jump-extended Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) square root model show a significant computational advantage over the Longstaff and Schwartz's (2001) least-squares regression method (ISM) for pricing American options on zero-coupon bonds.

A High-Dimensional Choice Model for Online Retailing,"Online retailers are facing an increasing variety of product choices and diversified consumer decision journeys. To improve many operations decisions for online retailers, such as demand forecasting and inventory management and pricing, an important first step is to obtain an accurate estimate of the substitution patterns among a large number of products offered in the complex online environment. Classic choice models either do not account for these substitution patterns beyond what is reflected through observed product features or do so in a simplified way by making a priori assumptions. These shortcomings become particularly restrictive when the underlying substitution patterns get complex as the number of options increases. We provide a solution by developing a high-dimensional choice model that allows for flexible substitution patterns and easily scales up. We leverage consumer clickstream data and combine econometric and machine learning (graphical lasso, in particular) methods to learn the substitution patterns among a large number of products. We show our method offers more accurate demand forecasts in a wide range of synthetic scenarios when compared with classical models (e.g., the independent and identically distributed Probit model), reducing out-of-sample mean absolute percentage error by 10%-30%. Such performance improvement is further supported by observations from a real-world empirical setting. More importantly, our method excels in precisely recovering substitution patterns across products. Compared with benchmark models, it reduces the percentage deviation from the underlying elasticity matrix by approximately half. This precision serves as a critical input for enhancing business decisions such as assortment planning, inventory management, and pricing strategies.",2025
Applied nonparametric regression techniques: Estimating prepayments on fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities,"We assess nonparametric kernel-density regression as a technique for estimating mortgage loan prepayments-one of the key components in pricing highly volatile mortgage-backed securities and their derivatives. The highly nonlinear and so-called irrational behavior of the prepayment function lends itself well to an estimator that is free of both functional and distributional assumptions. The technique is shown to exhibit superior out-of-sample predictive ability compared to both proportional-hazards and proprietary-practitioner models. Moreover, the best kernel model provides this improved predictive power utilizing a more parsimonious specification in terms of both data and covariates. We conclude that the technique may prove useful in other financial modeling applications, such as default modeling, and other derivative pricing problems where highly nonlinear relationships and optionality exist.",2001
Pricing and promotion strategies of an online shop based on customer segmentation and multiple objective decision making,"The advent of the Internet and web technologies has enabled the prosperity of virtual stores, which greatly reduce customers' search costs and retailers' overhead. However, the furious competition between online shops makes it difficult for them to generate profits. This study attempts to establish pricing and promotion strategies for online shops to enhance their profitability. The pricing decision is based on the concept of customer relationship management, where a greater margin of price concession is given to customers who are more valuable to the shop. The process of our approach is: clustering customers into different classes based on their RFM data, computing and presenting the list prices of products to customers according to their classes, allowing customers to bargain over the price and offering conceded prices which are computed based on customer classes and a multi-objective decision making model, and finally providing promotion options to customers to reinforce their purchase inclination.

Valuing portfolios of interdependent real options using influence diagrams and simulation-and-regression: A multi-stage stochastic integer programming approach,"Although real options generally occur within portfolios, most valuation approaches based on either option pricing or decision analysis alone focus on single well-defined options. In this paper we present a new approach for modelling and approximating the value of portfolios of interdependent real options using both influence diagrams and simulation-and-regression. The key feature of this approach is that it translates the interdependencies between real options into a set of constraints and then directly models the dynamics of all underlying uncertainties using (Markovian) stochastic processes. These are then integrated in a portfolio optimisation problem which is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic integer program. Applying a simulation and parametric regression approach to approximate the value of this optimisation problem, we present a transparent valuation algorithm that explicitly takes into account vector-valued exercise decisions and the state variable's multidimensional resource component. The approach is therefore applicable to a wide range of complex investment projects with both inherent interdependent flexibilities and many underlying uncertainties. The approach is illustrated by evaluating a complex natural resource investment that features both a large portfolio of interdependent real options and four stochastic factors. We analyse the way in which the approximated value of the portfolio and its individual options are affected by the initial copper price as well as by the degrees of production cost and copper price uncertainty.

"Challenges of Measuring Revenue, Margin and Yield Optimization in Container Shipping","We present in this paper some initial ideas of Revenue and Yield Management in the container shipping industry, namely a regression study of the behavior of the currently used indicator for measuring pricing and revenue performance in a leading shipping line. We consider the properties of the indicator used and discuss options of developing a better indicators of revenue or yield optimization, being either revenue or yield per available unit. At the end we also formulate implications for a future research work to be done on development of relevant measures for the industry.",2013
Valuation of an option using non-parametric methods,"This paper provides a general valuation model to fairly price a European option using parametric and non-parametric methods. In particular, we show how to use the historical simulation (HS) method, a well-known non-parametric statistical method applied in the financial area, to price an option. The advantage of the HS method is that one can directly obtain the distribution of stock returns from historical market data. Thus, it not only does a good job in capturing any characteristics of the return distribution, such as clustering and fat tails, but it also eliminates the model errors created by mis-specifying the distribution of underlying assets. To solve the problem of measuring transformation in valuing options, we use the Esscher's transform to convert the physical probability measure to the forward probability measure. Taiwanese put and call options are used to illustrate the application of this method. To clearly show which model prices stock options most accurately, we compare the pricing errors from the HS method with those from the Black-Scholes (BS) model. The results show that the HS model is more accurate than the BS model, regardless for call or put options. More importantly, because there is no complex mathematical theory underlying the HS method, it can easily be applied in practice and help market participants manage complicated portfolios effectively.",2019
NIG-Levy process in asset price modeling: case of Estonian companies,"As an asset is traded at fair value, its varying price trace an interesting trajectory reflecting in a general way the asset's value and underlying economic activities. These trajectory exhibit jumps, clustering and a host of other properties not usually captured by Gaussian based models. Levy processes offer the possibility of distinguishing jumps, diffusion, drift and the laxity to answer questions on frequency, continuity, etc. An important feature of normal inverse Gaussian-Levy (NIG-Levy) model is its path richness: it can model so many small jumps in a way that eliminates the need for a Gaussian component; hence, limitations arising from Gaussian based models are almost eliminated. Secondly, the characteristics listed above are reflected in the Levy triplet and are easily introduced in the modeling picture through estimated Levy parameters. Thirdly, knowledge of NIG-Levy parameters enables us to use NIG-Levy models as underlying asset price models for pricing financial derivatives. We use the R open software to calculate Levy parameters for 12 Estonian companies and choose good NIG-Levy asset price models by the method proposed by Kaarik and Umbleja (2011). We observe that not all financial data of Estonian companies trading on the Tallinn Stock Exchange between 01 Jan 2008 - 01 Jan 2012 can be effectively modeled by NIG-Levy process, despite having Levy parameters. Those positively modeled are recommended as underlying assets for pricing financial derivatives.",2012
Does the left-digit bias affect prices in financial markets?,"According to the left-digit bias, people pay more attention to the leftmost digits of a number and tend to disregard the last digits of that number. We investigate whether this bias affects traders' perception and pricing in a large financial market trading foreign exchange options. Our theoretical model predicts that the left-digit bias affects prices, causing a discontinuous jump in expected returns when comparing markets at threshold prices 10, , 20, , ... , 90 with markets at prices just below these thresholds, such as 9 . 9 , 19.99, . 99, etc. The model predicts no discontinuity in returns among unbiased traders. Using a regression discontinuity approach over the returns of more than 1 million options, we find significant discontinuities in the expected returns, consistent with mispricing induced by the left-digit bias.",2024
Daily volatility forecasts: Reassessing performance of GARCH models,"Volatility plays a key role in asset and portfolio management and derivatives pricing. As such, accurate measures and good forecasts of volatility are crucial for the implementation and evaluation of asset and derivative pricing models in addition to trading and hedging strategies. However, whilst GARCH models are able to capture the observed clustering effect in asset price volatility in-sample, they appear to provide relatively poor out-of-sample forecasts. Recent research has suggested that this relative failure of GARCH models arises not from a failure of the model but a failure to specify correctly the 'true volatility' measure against which forecasting performance is measured. It is argued that the standard approach of using ex post daily squared returns as the measure of 'true volatility' includes a large noisy component. An alternative measure for 'true volatility' has therefore been suggested, based upon the cumulative squared returns from intra-day data. This paper implements that technique and reports that, in a dataset of 17 daily exchange rate series, the GARCH model outperforms smoothing and moving average techniques which have been previously identified as providing superior volatility forecasts.

The pricing efficiency of exchange-traded commodities,"Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) open the commodity markets to both private and institutional investors. This paper is the first to examine the pricing efficiency and potential determinants of price deviations of this new class of derivatives based on daily data of 237 ETCs traded on the German market from 2006 to 2012. Given the unique size of the sample, we employ the premium/discount analysis, quadratic and linear pricing methods, as well as regression models. We find that the ETCs incur, on average, price deviations in their daily trading and are more likely to trade at a premium from their net asset values than at a discount. In addition, we examine the influence of certain factors such as management fees, commodity sectors, issuers, spread, assets under management, investment strategies, replication and collateralization methods on quadratic and linear price deviations.",2018
Pricing path-dependent Bermudan options using Wiener chaos expansion: an embarrassingly parallel approach,"In this work, we propose a new policy iteration algorithm for pricing Bermudan options when the payoff process cannot be written as a function of a lifted Markov process. Our approach is based on a modification of the well-known Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm: we basically replace the standard least squares regression with a Wiener chaos expansion. This not only allows us to deal with a non-Markovian setting but also breaks the bottleneck induced by the least squares regression, as the coefficients of the chaos expansion are given by scalar products on the L-2(Omega) space and can therefore be approximated by independent Monte Carlo computations. This key feature enables us to propose an embarrassingly parallel algorithm to efficiently handle non-Markovian payoff.",2020
Regime Classification and Stock Loan Valuation,"For traditional perpetual American put options under regime-switching models, the risk-free interest rates are typically assumed to be positive, and optimal stopping usually can occur in any regime. However, this may not hold true when the risk-free interest rates are allowed to be equal to zero (the interest rate may drop to zero in reality, e.g., in certain periods in Japan); there may exist continuation regimes within which optimal stopping can never occur, that is, within which stopping is never optimal. In this paper, we develop a unified, fixed point approach to determining all continuation regimes explicitly for the pricing problem of perpetual American put options under general regime-switching exponential Levy models with any finite numbers of regimes and general Levy types, in which the risk-free interest rate in each regime is nonnegative and the discounted stock price with the dividends reinvested is not necessarily a martingale. As an important application of this regime classification result, we provide a unified framework for the valuation of infinite maturity stock loans under general regime-switching exponential Levy models with any finite numbers of regimes and general Levy types, which can be formulated as the pricing problem of perpetual American call options with negative interest rates. Applying this unified approach yields analytical solutions to the infinite maturity stock loan prices under both the general exponential Levy models without regime switching and the regime-switching phase-type jump diffusion models with any finite numbers of regimes and with or without dividends, which include some related results in the literature as special cases.",2020
Rolling Adjoints: Fast Greeks along Monte Carlo scenarios for early-exercise options,"In this paper we extend the Stochastic Grid Bundling Method (SGBM), a regress-later Monte Carlo scheme for pricing early-exercise options, with an adjoint method to compute in a highly efficient manner the option sensitivities (the Greeks) along the Monte Carlo paths, with reasonable accuracy. The path-wise SGBM Greeks computation is based on the conventional path-wise sensitivity analysis, however, for a regress-later technique. The resulting sensitivities at the end of the monitoring period are implicitly rolled over into the sensitivities of the regression coefficients of the previous monitoring date. For this reason, we name the method Rolling Adjoints, which facilitates Smoking Adjoints [M. Giles, P. Glasserman, Smoking adjoints: fast Monte Carlo Greeks, Risk 19 (1) (2006) 88-92] to compute conditional sensitivities along the paths for options with early-exercise features.

Generalized parameter functions for option pricing,"We extend the benchmark nonlinear deterministic volatility regression functions of Dumas et al. (1998) to provide a semi-parametric method where an enhancement of the implied parameter values is used in the parametric option pricing models. Besides volatility, skewness and kurtosis of the asset return distribution can also be enhanced. Empirical results, using closing prices of the S&P 500 index call options (in one day ahead out-of-sample pricing tests), strongly support our method that compares favorably with a model that admits stochastic volatility and random jumps. Moreover, it is found to be Superior in various robustness tests. Our semi-parametric approach is an effective remedy to the curse of dimensionality presented in nonparametric estimation and its main advantage is that it delivers theoretically consistent option prices and hedging parameters. The economic significance of the approach is tested in terms of hedging, where the evaluation and estimation loss functions are aligned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2010
Association of Reference Pricing with Drug Selection and Spending,"BACKGROUND In the United States, prices for therapeutically similar drugs vary widely, which has prompted efforts by public and private insurers to steer patients toward the lower-priced options. Under reference pricing, the insurer or employer establishes a maximum contribution it will make toward the price of a drug or procedure, and the patient pays the remainder. METHODS We used difference-in-differences multivariable regression methods to analyze changes in prescriptions and pricing for 1302 drugs in 78 therapeutic classes in the United States, before and after implementation of reference pricing by an alliance of private employers. We assessed trends for the study group relative to those for an employee group that was not subject to reference pricing. The study included 1,122,741 prescriptions that were reimbursed during the period from 2010 through 2014. RESULTS Implementation of reference pricing was associated with a higher percentage of prescriptions that were filled for the lowest-priced reference drug within its therapeutic class (difference in probability, 7.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 9.9), a lower average price paid per prescription (-13.9%; 95% CI, -23.8 to -2.7), and a higher rate of copayment by patients (5.2%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 10.4) than in the comparison group. During the first 18 months after implementation, spending for employers was $1.34 million lower and the amount of copayments for employees was $0.12 million higher than in the comparison group. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of reference pricing was associated with significant changes in drug selection and spending for a population of patients covered by employment-based insurance in the United States.",2017
Effect Mechanism Research of Carbon Price Drivers in China-A Case Study of Shenzhen,"Revealing the effect mechanism of carbon price drivers is the basis to establish the pricing mechanism of carbon emission exchange, which also promotes the development of the carbon emission exchange market and can reduce the investment risk. Based on the previous research, the cointegration test, Granger causality test, and ridge regression estimate are used to analyze the effect mechanism between the domestic carbon price and its drivers. Johansen's cointegration analysis reveals that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the domestic carbon price and energy price, industrial development level, climate change, and financial prosperity. Ridge regression estimates reveal that the international spot price of thermal coal in the ARA port and the spot price of Brent crude oil in Britain are negatively correlated with the domestic carbon price, while CER futures price is positively correlated with the domestic carbon price. There is a linkage between the international carbon price and the domestic carbon price. Since 2017, the domestic carbon price has been lower than the equilibrium value, and the value of carbon emission rights has been underestimated. With the continuous improvement of the domestic carbon market, the carbon price will rise and fluctuate around the equilibrium price in the future.",2022
Indexed executive stock options,"We design and derive a pricing model for an executive stock option with a strike price indexed to a benchmark and investigate its valuation and incentive implications. In both up and down markets, the indexed option filters out common risks beyond the executive's control, thereby increasing the efficiency of incentive contracts, The indexed option has a different payoff structure and much lower initial value than a traditional option. Incentive effects of the indexed option also differ from those of traditional options. We design an optional penalty function to reduce the payoff if executives manipulate specified model parameters such as volatility. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Global energy supply risk: Evidence from the reactions of European natural gas futures to Nord Stream announcements,"Motivated by recent geopolitical challenges to globalization, finance scholarship has a growing interest in the risks to economies of key supply chains. We explore the effect of Nord Stream pipeline development on daily natural gas prices in Europe. Reviewing a comprehensive list of 24 announcements related to Nord Stream pipeline developments, stoppages, and sanctions for 2013-2022, we investigate their direct impact on the volatility and returns of Dutch TTF natural gas futures. Employing bootstrap quantile regression, we find that the effects of such announcements are highly significant, especially during periods of low TTF volatility and returns distributions. Moreover, results show that both COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war strenghtened the corre-lation between Nord Stream pipeline announcements and TTF market reactions, consistent with energy markets pricing geopolitical risks. Results, reflective of informed trading, warn of concentration risk in European gas markets, suggesting the need for policy actions to reduce supply-chain dependence. Taken together, we support the importance of diversifying both natural gas supply infrastructures and providers to mitigate geopolitical risk exposures and associated welfare costs to the real economy.",2023
Primal-dual linear Monte Carlo algorithm for multiple stoppingan application to flexible caps,"In this paper we consider the valuation of Bermudan callable derivatives with multiple exercise rights. We present in this context a new primal-dual linear Monte Carlo algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of the lower and upper price bounds without using nested simulations (hence the terminology). The algorithm is essentially an extension of the primal-dual Monte Carlo algorithm for standard Bermudan options proposed by Schoenmakers et al. [SIAM J. Finance Math., 2013, 4, 86-116] to the case of multiple exercise rights. In particular, the algorithm constructs upwardly a system of dual martingales to be plugged into the dual representation of Schoenmakers. At each level, the respective martingale is constructed via a backward regression procedure starting at the last exercise date. The thus constructed martingales are finally used to compute an upper price bound. The algorithm also provides approximate continuation functions that may be used to construct a price lower bound. The algorithm is applied to the pricing of flexible caps in a Hull and White model setup. The simple model choice allows for comparison of the computed price bounds with the exact price obtained by means of a trinomial tree implementation. As a result, we obtain tight price bounds for the considered application. Moreover, the algorithm is generically designed for multi-dimensional problems and is tractable to implement.",2013
Implementation of the Longstaff and Schwartz American Option Pricing Model on FPGA,"American style options are widely used financial products, whose pricing is a challenging problem due to their path dependency characteristic. Finite difference methods and tree-based methods can be used for American option pricing. However, the major drawback of these methods is that they can often only handle one or two sources of uncertainty; for more state variables they become computationally prohibitive, with computation times typically increasing exponentially with the number of state variables. Alternative solutions are the extended Monte Carlo methods, such as the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method suggested by Longstaff and Schwartz, which uses of regression to estimate continuation values from simulated paths. In this paper, we present an FPGA hardware architecture for the acceleration of the LSMC method, with Quasi-Monte Carlo path generation. Our FPGA hardware implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-4 XC4VFX100 chip achieves 25x and 18x speed-ups in the path generation and regression steps, respectively, compared to an equivalent pure software implementation captured in C++ and run on an Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz CPU. This provides overall speed-up of 20x compared to a CPU-based implementation. Power measurements also show that our FPGA implementation is 54x more energy efficient than the pure software implementation.",2012
Estimating trends in weather series: Consequences for pricing derivatives,"Predictions of future weather conditions play an important role in pricing weather derivatives. In many instances, the dates for which we require predictions are well beyond the point where physical forecasts have any skill. Under these circumstances, predictions are generated from statistical models of historic data. This paper derives conditions for which the predictive performance in regression is improved by ignoring or shrinking the contribution from some of the explanatory variables. We suggest methods for estimating the degree of shrinkage required in practice. We illustrate our methods using surface temperature data from fifteen stations in the United States.",2006
Reclaiming quasi-Monte Carlo efficiency in portfolio value-at-risk simulation through Fourier transform,"Quasi-Monte Carlo methods overcome the problem of sample clustering in regular Monte Carlo simulation and have been shown to improve simulation efficiency in the derivatives pricing literature when the price is expressed as a multidimensional integration and the integrand is suitably smooth. For portfolio value-at-risk (VaR) problems, the distribution of portfolio value change is based on the expectation of an indicator function, hence the integrand is discontinuous. The purpose of this paper is to smooth the expectation estimation of an indicator function via Fourier transform so that the faster convergence rate of quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be reclaimed theoretically. Under fairly mild assumptions, the simulation of portfolio value-at-risk is fast and accurate. Numerical examples elucidate the advantage of the proposed approach over regular Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods.",2006
Redispatch index for assessing bidding zone delineation,"This work addresses the problem of assessing to which extent a bidding zone delineation requires redispatching actions after the clearing of energy markets. Such issue arises in particular when policy makers review the organisation of electricity markets and question the design of uniform price zones. To avoid relying on arbitrarily-defined sensitive parameters, the authors propose a metrics based on information that is sufficient to perform nodal pricing for the whole region under consideration. The metrics is illustrated with a realistic model of the West-European power system considering two application cases, namely (i) selecting a clustering technique to define candidate bidding zones, and (ii) selecting candidate splitting and merging options for pre-existing bidding zones. Results show that the proposed index provides a consistent order of magnitude of the redispatching needs subsequent to market clearing, although it requires no specific user-defined parameters.",2017
Diminuendo! Tactics in Support of FaaS Migrations,"Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) receives close attention due to highly desirable characteristics, including pay-as-you-go pricing, high elasticity, and its fully managed nature. To leverage these benefits for existing applications, developers face the challenge of migrating legacy code to a FaaS platform (FaaSification). Unfortunately, however, actionable guidance on how to do so for real-world applications does not exist. In this paper, we report on our experience from FaaSifying a data-intensive application, and evaluating different options through extensive experimentation, using approaches such as regression tests and tracing. Based on the obtained results, we present five migration tactics in support of future FaaSification.",2020
Reverse-Engineering and Real Options-Adjusted CAPM in the Taiwan Stock Market,"Previous studies have addressed many anomalies that violate the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). However, recent studies have employed either the reverse-engineering (RE) approach or the options-adjusted approach to verify the validity of CAPM on the developed stock markets. This study simultaneously employs the two approaches on the Taiwan's stock market and obtains a consistent result with those on the developed stock markets. Additionally, this study compares the predicting stock return ability among various regression models and anomaly variables. For completeness, the betas of CAPM and Fama-French three factors are adopted from the historical, Vasicek-adjusted, and time-varying conditional betas.",2017
Probabilistic machine learning for local volatility,"The local volatility model is widely used for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. While its main appeal is its capability of reproducing any given surface of observed option prices - it provides a perfect fit - the essential component is a latent function that can be uniquely determined only in the limit of infinite data. To (re)construct this function, numerous calibration methods have been suggested that involve steps of interpolation and extrapolation, most often of parametric form and with point-estimate representations. We use probabilistic machine learning to look at the calibration problem in a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian processes. This immediately gives a way of encoding prior beliefs about the local volatility function and a hypothesis model that is highly flexible yet not prone to overfitting. Besides providing a method for calibrating a (range of) point estimate(s), we draw posterior inference from the distribution over local volatility. This leads to a better understanding of uncertainty associated with the model in general, and with the calibration in particular. Further, we infer dynamical properties of local volatility by augmenting the hypothesis space with a time dimension. Ideally, this provides predictive distributions not only locally, but also for entire surfaces forward in time. We apply our approach to S&P 500 market data.",2021
Global Sensitivity Analysis of Various Numerical Schemes for the Heston Model,"The pricing of financial options is usually based on statistical sampling of the evolution of the underlying under a chosen model, using a suitable numerical scheme. It is widely accepted that using low-discrepancy sequences instead of pseudorandom numbers in most cases increases the accuracy. It is important to understand and quantify the reasons for this effect. In this work, we use Global Sensitivity Analysis in order to study one widely used model for pricing of options, namely the Heston model. The Heston model is an important member of the family of the stochastic volatility models, which have been found to better describe the observed behaviour of option prices in the financial markets. By using a suitable numerical scheme, like those of Euler, Milstein, Kahl-Jackel, Andersen, one has the flexibility needed to compute European, Asian or exotic options. In any case the problem of evaluating an option price can be considered as a numerical integration problem. For the purposes of modelling and complexity reduction, one should make the distinction between the model nominal dimension and its effective dimension. Another notion of average dimension has been found to be more practical from the computational point of view. The definitions and methods of evaluation of effective dimensions are based on computing Sobol' sensitivity indices. A classification of functions based on their effective dimensions is also known. In the context of quantitative finance, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can be used to assess the efficiency of a particular numerical scheme. In this work we apply GSA based on Sobol sensitivity indices in order to assess the interactions of the various dimensions in using the above mentioned schemes. We observe that the GSA offers useful insight on how to maximize the advantages of using QMC in these schemes.",2020

For zero net supply assets. including financial derivatives with finite maturities, we show that bubbles can generally exist and have properties different from their discrete-time, infinite-horizon counterparts.

AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK IN SHORT-TERM ELECTRICAL LOAD FORECASTING OF A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS: A CASE STUDY,"This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) for forecasting the short-term electrical load of a university campus using real historical data from Colorado State University. A spatio-temporal ANN model with multiple weather variables as well as time identifiers, such as day of week and time of day, are used as inputs to the network presented. The choice of the number of hidden neurons in the network is made using statistical information and taking into account the point of diminishing returns. The performance of this ANN is quantified using three error metrics: the mean average percent error (MAPE); the error in the ability to predict the occurrence of the daily peak hour; and the difference in electrical energy consumption between the predicted and the actual values in a 24-hour period. These error measures provide a good indication of the constraints and applicability of these predictions.

Natural Gas Prices in the Framework of European Union's Energy Transition: Assessing Evolution and Drivers,"This study analyzes European natural gas (NG) prices since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients associate prices with and without taxation, whereas a hierarchical clustering analysis clarifies similarities in NG pricing behavior. After performing econometric tests to ensure the satisfaction of classical hypotheses and identify a system of endogenous variables, structured unrestricted and restricted vector autoregressive models are applied to panel data composed of 34 spatial units and 31 units of time drawn from 2007-2022 to confirm the presence of short-term and long-term causal dependencies. The nonparametric analysis identifies three groups of countries that exhibit a differentiated pricing behavior. The parametric analysis reveals a significant and asymmetric short run relation, which is imposed by liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Nigeria on the logarithm of NG prices. However, the sign of coefficients associated with lagged LNG imports varies across spatial units belonging to the sample. The error correction term is negative and significant, which implies evidence of cointegration. Since the main result identifies ambiguous short-term effects emerging from the diversification in favor of LNG imports from Nigeria, a straightforward policy recommendation is that this strategic option may be ill advised for Europe and, indirectly, it legitimizes the suggestion that alternative decarbonization options can play a prominent role in European NG markets in the near future.",2023
Impact of countries' role on trade prices from a nickel chain perspective: Based on complex network and panel regression analysis,"Recently the large fluctuation of nickel futures price makes the nickel trade price become the focus of policy-makers' attention. Affected by resource endowment and resource demand, the trade role of a country affects its pricing power in the international market. The impact is across the whole industry chain. Using the panel regression model and complex network model, this paper analyses the evolution trend of trade position for countries participating in nickel product trade from 2000 to 2019 from the perspective of the industry chain, and examines the impact of changes in the country's trade role on its trade prices. Finally, the pricing power of typical countries is quantified and visualized. The study found: (i) The trade market of nickel products shows a prosperous trend and the Asian factors play an important role. (ii) The trade role of the country has a significant cross-influence on trade prices in all links of the industrial chain. (iii) The trading role of the state in the upstream nickel ore and the downstream stainless steel affect the trade price of the whole industry chain through the pass-through effect of prices in the industry chain. (iv) China, the United States, India, and the industrialized nations of Europe already have terms of trade that affect prices. This research will help governments understand the role of the country in the trade of nickel products and the impact on market prices. In addition, it also provides theoretical support for policymakers to formulate trade policies and strategies.",2022

ElectroBlock: Reinforcement Learning and Blockchain-based Energy Trade to Optimize Tariffs,"Energy prices have increased by more than 62% globally on average, while power companies are trying to provide more affordable energy with different options: fixed-rate, slab-based tariffs, and Time-of-Use pricing. This article aims to combine blockchains, smart contracts, smart grids, energy forecasting through reinforcement learning, and energy trading between closed communities, bringing consumer savings. Our proposed model, ElectroBlock, uses the first 25 days of each month's energy usage history along with seasonal and exogenous factors to forecast the final end-of-month usage. Then with the forecast we can predict which customers are the most likely to be pushed to the next energy consumption slab and be charged at a higher rate for the remaining month. This allows these customers to be buyers, and seamlessly buy energy units from users who would sell, the energy units they are predicted to leave unused by the end of the month. Moreover, trading is done with WalletCoins, at a coin per kilowatt hour, but could also be traded directly for fiat currency. Furthermore, the power company makes a profit on every trade through transaction fees. Hence there is great incentive for both customers and power companies to adopt our proposed model. We integrated Hyperledger Fabric into our ElectroBlock prototype to store all customer data and prevent tampering with WalletCoin and consumption records. Finally, we did a performance analysis, on the actual cost savings based on a real-world dataset; and a scalability test for concurrency and customer bases on our prototype.",2024
Optimal Advance-Selling Strategy for Fashionable Products With Opportunistic Consumers Returns,"Advance-selling (AS) is a commonly observed industrial practice in which a retailer allows consumers to prebook the fashionable product before the real selling season starts. Motivated by this practice, this paper studies AS strategy for a retailer who sells a newsvendor-type of fashionable product in light of potential consumer opportunistic returns. In our model, the consumers face valuation uncertainty and know their valuation realization only after product acquisition. There also exists aggregate demand uncertainty, captured in the conventional newsvendor model. All preorders are fulfilled at the beginning of a normal-selling season. We build analytical optimization models and consider three strategic options for the retailer, namely, no advance-selling allowed (NAP), advance-selling with full refund (AFP) and advance-selling with partial refund (APP), where there are two suboptions under APP. We derive the retailer's optimal pricing and refund policies for each option. By comparing the results in the above options, important insights are generated. Finally, we conduct a numerical analysis to further examine the impacts brought by consumers valuation, market condition, and consumers classification on the optimal strategy.",2014
American Option Pricing with Importance Sampling and Shifted Regressions,"This paper proposes a new method for pricing American options that uses importance sampling to reduce estimator bias and variance in simulation-and-regression based methods. Our suggested method uses regressions under the importance measure directly, instead of under the nominal measure as is the standard, to determine the optimal early exercise strategy. Our numerical results show that this method successfully reduces the bias plaguing the standard importance sampling method across a wide range of moneyness and maturities, with negligible change to estimator variance. When a low number of paths is used, our method always improves on the standard method and reduces average root mean squared error of estimated option prices by 22.5%.",2021
A Simple Approach to Pricing American Options Under the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model,"In a recent study, Nawalkha, Beliaeva, and Zreik (NBZ) [2010] presented a multidimensional transform for generating path-independent trees for pricing American options under low-dimensional stochastic volatility models. For this class of models, this approach has higher accuracy than the GARCH tree method of Ritchken and Trevor [1999] and is computationally more efficient than the Monte Carlo regression method of Longstaff and Schwartz [2001] as well as the lattice method of Leisen [2000]. In this article, the authors give an explicit demonstration of the NBZ transform using the specific example of the Heston [1993] stochastic volatility model. Using the control variate method, this approach obtains highly accurate American option prices within a fraction of a second.",2010
Travel behavior and price preferences of bikesharing members and casual users: A Capital Bikeshare perspective,"Even though casual users of bikeshare account for a large share of ridership and revenue at public bikeshare systems in North America, very little is known about the characteristics and preferences of casual users and how they compare to registered members. The primary objectives of the study include identifying the similarities and differences between members and casual users along demographics, usage and indicated preferences; and examining and modeling pricing preferences of bikeshare users. An intercept survey was conducted to obtain demographic information, bikeshare usage and various preferences of Capital Bikeshare users in the metro Washington DC area. The survey data was validated against the data from an existing member survey with large sample using goodness of fit tests. Survey participants reported that single trip fare (STF) and annual membership paid at once as their preferred pricing options and a combination of STF, 24-hour pass, and annual membership with monthly installments as their favorable pricing model. Logistic regression findings indicate that, when compared to casual users, registered members are more likely to be White, earn more and reside in the D.C. area. Casual users make fewer bikeshare trips and are less sensitive to the service (station density) compared to members. Gender, age and income distribution do not appear to influence casual fare product choice. Results from this study are useful in policy-making, planning and operations for bikeshare systems.",2019
Testing for complementarities among countable strategies,"I study whether the pricing strategies of competing duopolists in the early US cellular telephone industry can be considered strategic complements or substitutes. In order to do so, I present a multivariate count data regression model that is suitable to test for the existence of strategic complementarities when firms make use of countable strategies. The estimator, which accommodates the underdispersion that characterizes the data, is shown to have better small-sample properties than common estimators based on the Gaussian copula. It also allows for correlations of any sign among counts independently of the dispersion parameters. Results show that in addition to screening consumers, competing firms imitated each other in the number of tariff options offered to their customers.",2014
Enhancing Option Pricing Accuracy in the Indian Market: A CNN-BiLSTM Approach,"Due to overly optimistic economic and statistical assumptions, the classical option pricing model frequently falls short of ideal predictions. Rapid progress in artificial intelligence, the availability of massive datasets, and the rise in computational power in machines have all created an environment conducive to the development of complex methods for predicting financial derivatives prices. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) based predictive model for accurate and prompt prediction of option prices by fusing a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). A set of 15 predictive factors is carefully built under the umbrella of fundamental market data and technical indicators. Our proposed model is compared with other DL-based models using six evaluation metrics-root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error, mean percentage error, determination coefficient (R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document}), maximum error and median absolute error. Further, statistical analysis of models is also done using one-way ANOVA and posthoc analysis using the Tukey HSD test to demonstrate that the CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms competing models in terms of fit and prediction accuracy.",2024
Analyzing Second and Third Moments of Electricity Prices,"The volatility of electricity prices is the important information for the risk management of electricity markets and the pricing of electricity financial derivatives. A multicycle GARCH-M model based on Gram-Charlier series expansion of the normal probability density function is proposed, in which the time trend, time-varying variance, time-vaying skewness, multicycles and the relationship among load and spot price can be fully taken into account. The numerical example based on the historical data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland electricity market shows that the time-varying variance and squared system load have a significant effect on the average daily electricity prices, there exist volatility clustering and weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly and semi-annual periods, and the second and third moments of electricity price series manifest the clear synchronous time-varying characteristics.

Linearly Autonomous Symmetries of a Fractional Gueant-Pu Model,"We study the group structure of the Gueant-Pu equation of the fractional order with respect to the price of the underlying asset variable. It is one of the models of the dynamics of options pricing, taking into account transaction costs. The search for continuous groups of linearly autonomous equivalence transformations is carried out. The equivalence transformations found are used in constructing a group classification (within the framework of linearly autonomous transformations) of the equation under consideration with a nonlinear function in the right side of the equation as a free element. In the case of a nonzero risk-free rate, it is shown that two cases of Lie algebras of the equation under study are possible: two-dimensional in the case of a special type of free element and one-dimensional in the remaining cases. If the risk-free rate is zero, there are four variants of the Lie algebra, which can be two-, three-, or four-dimensional. In the future, we assume to use the obtained group classification in calculating invariant solutions and conservation laws of the model under study.",2023
Dimension reduction for Quasi-Monte Carlo methods via quadratic regression,"Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have been gaining popularity in computational finance as they are competitive alternatives to Monte Carlo methods that can accelerate numerical accuracy. This paper develops a new approach for reducing the effective dimension combined with a randomized QMC method. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is its sample- based transformation that enables us to choose a flexible manipulation via regression. In the proposed approach, the first step is to perform a regression using the samples to estimate the parameters of the regression model. An optimal transformation is proposed based on the regression result to minimize the effective dimension. An advantage of this approach is that adopting a statistical approach allows greater flexibility in selecting the regression model. In addition to a linear model, this paper proposes a dimension reduction method based on a linear-quadratic model for regression. In numerical experiments, we focus on pricing different types of exotic options to test the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that different regression models are chosen depending on the underlying risk process and the type of derivative securities. In particular, we show several examples where the proposed method works while existing dimension reductions are ineffective.",2025
An efficient portfolio loss model,"We propose a new parsimonious model for valuating portfolio credit derivatives dependent on aggregate loss. The starting point is the loss distribution, which is constructed to be time dependent. We let the loss be beta distributed, and, by implication, the loss process becomes a stochastic jump process, where a jump corresponds to losses appearing simultaneously. The model matches empirical loss data well with only two parameters in addition to expected loss. The size of the jump is controlled by the clustering parameter, and the temporal correlation of jumps is controlled by the autocorrelation parameter. The full model is relatively efficient to implement, as we use a Monte Carlo at portfolio level. We derive analytical expressions for valuating tranches and for calculating regulatory capital. We provide examples of credit default swap index tranche pricing, including forward starting tranches. Comparisons are made with the one-factor Gaussian copula default time model, which fits historical loss data badly and has a deficient loss volatility term structure.",2019
Comparing the Hedging Effectiveness of Weather Derivatives Based on Remotely Sensed Vegetation Health Indices and Meteorological Indices,"Weather derivatives are considered a promising agricultural risk management tool. Station-based meteorological indices typically provide the data underlying these instruments. However, the main shortcoming of these weather derivatives is an imperfect correlation between the weather index and the yield of the insured crop, called basis risk. This paper considers three available remotely sensed vegetation health (VH) indices, namely, the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the vegetation health index (VHI), as indices for weather derivatives in a German case study. We investigated the correlation and period of highest correlation with winter wheat yield. Moreover, we analyzed whether the use of remotely sensed VH indices for weather derivatives can reduce basis risk and thus improve the performance of weather derivatives. The two commonly used meteorological indices, precipitation and temperature sums, were employed as benchmarks. Quantile regression and index value simulation were used for the design and pricing of the weather derivatives. The analysis for the selected farms and corresponding counties in northeastern Germany revealed that, on average, the VHI resulted in the highest correlation with winter wheat yield, and VHI-based weather derivatives were also superior in terms of the hedging effectiveness. The total periods of the highest correlations ranged from the beginning of April to the end of July. VHI- and VCI-based weather derivatives led to statistically significant reductions of basis risk, compared to the benchmarks. Our results indicate that the VHI-based weather derivatives can be useful alternatives to meteorological indices, especially in regions with sparser weather station networks.",2018
Sieve estimation of option-implied state price density,"This paper proposes a nonparametric estimator for the state price density implied by a single cross-section of European options with different strikes and the same maturity. The proposed estimator has two distinctive features. First, it extracts information from both call and put options, as opposed to only call options. Second, it does not require estimating any second-order derivative; instead, it solves a constrained and penalized linear regression. The asymptotic analysis faces two challenges because the state price density is defined by a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind with an unbounded support, and the kernel function is unbounded and non-differentiable. We address these challenges by exploiting the structure of the option pricing problem. After establishing the estimator's consistency and convergence rate, we apply it to estimate the state price densities implied by the S&P500 index options and those by the VIX options. The sample period includes the recent financial crisis and the Great Recession, during which the turbulent market conditions imposed substantial challenges on the estimation. We show that the estimator can work with both daily and high-frequency observations. We also study whether the various features of this density can predict future asset returns and obtain positive findings. Finally, we apply the method to examine the causal effects of monetary policy announcements on the financial market, using high-frequency data. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2021
The application of Monte Carlo simulation in European call option pricing,"Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method to solve the problem of option pricing. This article introduces the definition of option, the classification of option according to different standards and methods to evaluate the option. Then it focuses on the problem of how to use the method of Monte Carlo simulation to solve the option valuation of the European call option. Next it analyzes the algorithm of Wiener process, the algorithm of stock price model, and the algorithm of European call option. Finally it changes some parameters to observe its effect on option valuation. This series of steps show how to use the Monte Carlo simulation method to value the option in detail. After reading this article, even if a beginner can have a preliminary understanding of the options, and write some relevant programs based on this article.",2016
Determinants of Cookstoves and Fuel Choice Among Rural Households in India,"Roughly 2.8 billion people depend on solid fuels for cooking needs, resulting in a tremendous burden of disease from exposure to household air pollution. Despite decades of effort to promote cleaner cooking technologies, displacement of polluting technologies has progressed slowly. This paper describes results of a randomized controlled trial in which eight communities in two regions of rural India were presented with a range of cooking choices including improved solid fuel stoves and clean cooking options like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and induction stoves. Using survey data and logistic and multinomial regression, we identify factors associated with two outcomes: (1) pre-intervention ownership of non-solid fuel technologies and (2) household preferences for clean fuels from the range of cooking options offered. The analysis allows us to examine the influence of education, wealth, gender empowerment, stove pricing, and stove exchanges, among other variables. The majority of participants across all communities selected the cleanest options, LPG and induction, irrespective of price, but there is some variation in preferences. Wealth and higher caste stand out as significant predictors of pre-intervention ownership and non-solid fuel cooking options as well as preference for cleaner technologies offered through the intervention. The experimental treatments also influence preferences in some communities. When given the opportunity to exchange, communities in one region are more likely to choose solid fuel stoves (P<0.05). Giving free stoves had mixed results; households in one region are more likely to select clean options (P<0.05), but households in the other region prefer solid fuels (P<0.10).",2019
Electricity pricing and market power-evidence from Germany,"The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for measuring the exercise of potential market power in liberalized electricity markets. We therefore investigate producer behavior in the context of electricity pricing with respect to fundamental time-dependent marginal cost (TMC), i.e., CO2- and fuel cost. In doing so, we do not-in contrast to most current approaches to market power investigation-rely on an estimate of the entire generation cost, which inevitably suffers from the lack of appropriate available data. Applying an analytical model of a day-ahead electricity market, we derive work-on rates, which provide information about the impact of TMC variations on electricity prices in the market constellations of perfect competition, quasi-monopoly, and monopoly. Comparing these model-based work-on rates with actual work-on rates, estimated by an adjusted first-differences regression model of German power prices on the cost for hard coal, natural gas, and emission allowances, we find evidence of the exercise of market power in the period 2006-2008. However, our results reveal that German market competitiveness increases marginally. We confirm our results by simulating a TMC-driven diffusion model of futures power prices estimated by maximum-likelihood. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2009
Elements of strategic cost management: exploring relationship with strategic options,"Objective: This study analyzes the relationship between Elements of Strategic Costs Management (SCM) and Strategic Options in companies listed in the Brazilian Stock Market. A total of 40 companies from different sectors were surveyed using Management Reports. Method: To categorize the data, we used a checklist composed of predefined categories and subcategories based on characteristics of the Elements and Strategic Options. For the analysis of the relationship between the variables, multiple linear regression by the Stepwise method was used. Originality/Relevance: The study starts from a gap in the theoretical cut-offs about the relation between strategic options and types of control adopted by the company, mainly related to the Elements of SCM. In Brazilian studies on SCM elements, it is the first to employ a framework that considers the three main strategic variables used in the SCM literature. Results: The relationship between strategic options and the use of certain elements was found. Elements related to cost analysis and structural determinants are most cited by prospective companies and companies that seek differentiation. Companies using hold strategy cite more elements linked to the actions of customers, suppliers, and strategic pricing. Activity-based costing / activity-based management, total cost of ownership, open accounting, quality cost management, and utilization of production capacity didn't show any relation to strategic options. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: It's unheard of the significant relationship found between analytical typology and certain elements since there was no such evidence in any other study addressed in this research. The study provides empirical evidence that Strategic Options relate to elements of SCM used by companies.",2020
A Weighted Strike-Related Implied Volatility Model,"The implied volatility in the Black-Scholes model is assumed as a constant. However, empirical analysis proves that the values of the implied volatility based on the same underlying asset vary with the underlying asset price, maturity date, time to maturity, and the strike price. Ronald Lagnado and Stanley Osher and Chiarella proposed the techniques for calibrating derivative pricing by solving an inverse problem. In this paper, an improved model is proposed. In which, the influence of the options with different strike prices is distinguished by weights and the choices of the weight functions are discussed. The approach we take is numerically solving an inverse problem which is more solid in theory than simple regression methods. Numerical results show that our model has better adaptivity and accuracy than traditional models.",2018
Volatility Characteristics of Electricity Price based on the normal distribution probability density function,"The distribution properties of electricity prices are the important information for the risk management of electricity markets and the pricing of electricity financial derivatives. With comprehensive consideration of the changing rules of the electricity spot price, a multicycle GARCH-M model based on Gram-Charlier series expansion of the normal density function is proposed, in which the second moment, third moment and multicycle of electricity price series are described by time-varying variance, time-varying skewness and sine function. The changing trend, volatility of second and third moments, multicycle and the relationship among load and spot price can be fully taken into account. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that time-varying variance and the system load square have a significant effect on the mean electricity prices, there exist second moment volatility clustering and weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly and semi-annual periods, and the second and third moments of electricity price series manifest the clear synchronous time-varying characteristics.",2011
Portfolio diversification using subspace factorizations,"Successful investment management relies on allocating assets so as to beat the stock market. Asset classes are affected by different market dynamics or latent trends. These interactions are crucial to the successful allocation or monies. The seminal work on portfolio management by Markowitz prompts the adroit investment manager to consider the correlation between the assets in his portfolio and to vary his selection so as to optimize his risk-return profile. The factor model, a popular model for the return generating process has been used for portfolio construction and assumes that there is a low rank representation of the stocks. In this work we contribute a new approach to portfolio diversification by comparing a recently developed clustering technique, SemiNMF, with a new sparse low-rank approximate factorization technique, Sparse-semiNMF, for clustering stocks into latent trend based groupings as opposed to the traditional sector based groupings. We evaluate these techniques using a diffusion model based on the Black-Scholes options pricing model. We conclude that Sparse-semiNMF outperforms semiNMF when applied to synthetic stocks as the contribution of each trend to each stock is more disjoint for Sparse-semiNMF than for semiNMF, in an inter-class sense, meaning that the underlying trends for each stock are more readily apparent, whilst preserving the accuracy of the factorization. We conclude that the trend-based asset classes generated by Sparse-semiNMF should be considered in the investment management process to reduce the risk in portfolio selection.",2008
A model for interest rates with clustering effects,"We propose a model for short-term rates driven by a self-exciting jump process to reproduce the clustering of shocks on the Euro overnight index average (EONIA). The key element of the model is the feedback effect between the absolute value of jumps and the intensity of their arrival process. In this setting, we obtain a closed-form solution for the characteristic function for interest rates and their integral. We introduce a class of equivalent measures under which the features of the process are preserved. We infer the prices of bonds and their dynamics under a risk-neutral measure. The question of derivatives pricing is developed under a forward measure, and a numerical algorithm is proposed to evaluate caplets and floorlets. The model is fitted to EONIA rates from 2004 to 2014 using a peaks-over-threshold procedure. From observation of swap curves over the same period, we filter the evolution of risk premiums for Brownian and jump components. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of implied caplet volatility to parameters defining the level of self-excitation.",2016

A general control variate method for multi-dimensional SDEs: An application to multi-asset options under local stochastic volatility with jumps models in finance,"This paper presents a new control variate method for general multi-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) including jumps in order to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo method. Our control variate method is based on an asymptotic expansion technique, and does not require an explicit characteristic function of SDEs. This is an extension of previous researches using asymptotic expansions to obtain the control variates for such general models. Moreover, in our control variate method, the regression estimators can be chosen for each number of jump times with a stratified sampling, and improve the efficiency of the variance reduction. This paper also provides the asymptotic bias and variance of our method in terms of its terminal time and a small noise parameter used in an asymptotic expansion method. For an application of our method, we evaluate multi-asset options whose payoffs are expressed as linear functions of the underlying asset price processes in general local stochastic volatility with jumps models, and show a calculation scheme of control variates for Greeks. In numerical experiments, we apply the new control variate method to pricing basket, spread, and average options and Delta of basket options under a ZABR-type local stochastic volatility model with jumps, and confirm that our method works very well.

Pricing American option under exponential Levy Jump-diffusion model using Random Forest instead of least square regression,"In this paper, we aim to propose a new hybrid version of the Longstaff and Schwartz algorithm under the exponential Levy Jump-diffusion model using Random Forest regression. For this purpose, we will build the evolution of the option price according to the number of paths. Further, we will show how this approach numerically depicts the convergence of the option price towards an equilibrium price when the number of simulated trajectories tends to a large number. In the second stage, we will compare this hybrid model with the classical model of the Longstaff and Schwartz algorithm (as a benchmark widely used by practitioners in pricing American options) in terms of computation time, numerical stability and accuracy. At the end of this paper, we will test both approaches on the Microsoft share MSFT as an example of a real market.",2023
Research on wave image analysis in the implied volatility of stock options,"The study of volatility rarely starts from the perspective of implied volatility, and rarely combines stochastic volatility models with option pricing, which is a major flaw in research. Based on this, this study combined image processing technology to construct the wave image processing model and analyze the implied volatility of stock options and combined the image processing method to construct the implicit volatility surface output model. At the same time, the implied volatility surface model is constructed by mobile phone big data, image segmentation and noise processing are performed by image processing, and the performance of the model is analyzed by regression analysis. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the model. The results show that the model constructed in this paper has certain effects and can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research.",2020
Nonlinear Monte Carlo Schemes for Counterparty Risk on Credit Derivatives,"Two nonlinear Monte Carlo schemes, namely, the linear Monte Carlo expansion with randomization of Fujii and Takahashi (Int J Theor Appl Financ 15(5):1250034(24), 2012 [9], Q J Financ 2(3), 1250015(24), 2012, [10]) and the marked branching diffusion scheme of Henry-Labordere (Risk Mag 25(7), 67-73, 2012, [13]), are compared in terms of applicability and numerical behavior regarding counterparty risk computations on credit derivatives. This is done in two dynamic copula models of portfolio credit risk: the dynamic Gaussian copula model and the model in which default dependence stems from joint defaults. For such high-dimensional and nonlinear pricing problems, more standard deterministic or simulation/regression schemes are ruled out by Bellman's curse of dimensionality and only purely forward Monte Carlo schemes can be used.",2016
On estimating the yield and volatility curves,"Yield curve and yield volatilities are important inputs for pricing interest rate derivatives, for generation of interest rate scenarios, etc. Nonanticipated errors in their estimates may essentially influence the resulting prices, yields and risks. In this paper we explore and compare several types of parametric and nonparametric regression models suitable for estimation of the two curves. In contrast to purely numerical fitting procedures, these methods provide also an information about the precision of the fitted curves and a test of the goodness-of-fit of the postulated parametric model. The parametric models of yield curves are represented by the nonlinear and linearized Bradley-Crane model which is compared with Nadaraya-Watson and Priestley-Chao nonparametric estimators and with cubic splines. The reported numerical experience is based on data from the Italian bond market.",1997
A Functional Approach to Accelerating Monte Carlo based American Option Pricing,"We study the feasibility and performance efficiency of expressing a complex financial numerical algorithm with high-level functional parallel constructs. The algorithm we investigate is a least-square regression-based Monte-Carlo simulation for pricing American options. We propose an accelerated parallel implementation in Futhark, a high-level functional data-parallel language. The Futhark language targets GPUs as the compute platform and we achieve a performance comparable to, and in particular cases up to 2.5x better than, an implementation optimised by NVIDIA CUDA engineers. In absolute terms, we can price a put option with 1 million simulation paths and 100 time steps in 17 ms on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Furthermore, the high-level functional specification is much more accessible to the financial-domain experts than the low-level CUDA code, thus promoting code maintainability and facilitating algorithmic changes.",2019
Deep Learning Based Grapevine Leaf Classification Using Augmented Images and Multi-Classifier Fusion for Improved Accuracy and Precision,"Grapevines mainly produce grapes, which can be enjoyed fresh or processed. Grapevine leaves are also collected annually as a secondary product, with their variety impacting both pricing and flavor. This research utilizes Deep Learning techniques to classify grapevine leaves based on images. Initially, 500 images of vine leaves representing five species are captured using a unique self-illumination system. Data augmentation methods expand the dataset to 2500 images. Classification is conducted using a modern CNN model, specifically fine-tuned MobileNetv2. Data preparation involves training the dataset with three classifiers: basic CNN, VGG19, and MobileNet. Image processing converts the RGBA dataset into RGB format. The dataset is split into three subsets: 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. Model preparation offers three options for selecting the appropriate architecture: Simple CNN, VGG19, and Transfer Learning with MobileNet. Model analysis assesses performance using key metrics and visualizations, achieving an accuracy of 96% with Adam optimizer and 88% with Stochastic Gradient Descent.",2024
Forecasting spot prices of agricultural commodities in India: Application of deep-learning models,"Food price fluctuations can impact both producers and consumers. Forecasting the prices of the agricultural commodities is of prime concern not only to the government but also to farmers and agribusiness firms. In developing countries like India, management of food security needs competent and efficient forecasting of food prices. With the availability of data, recent innovation in deep-learning models provides a feasible solution to accurately forecast the prices. In this study, we examine the superiority of these models using the daily spot prices of five major commodities traded on the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange: cotton seed, castor seed, rape mustard seed, soybean seed, and guar seed. The results were obtained from the application of the traditional univariate autoregressive integrated moving average model and deep-learning techniques like the time-delay neural network (TDNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The empirical results indicate that the LSTM model is indeed suitable for the financial domain and captures the directional movement of the spot price changes with high accuracy compared with the TDNN and other linear models. Accuracy of the performance of these models has been compared using out-of-sample performance measure. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of spot price forecasting for farmers and traders in offering them the best predictions of the price movements. Our results provide a possibility of developing pricing models that can help in fairly regulating agricultural commodity prices.",2021
How the political elite make decisions,"The political elite make policy decisions in noisy environments and under time pressure, and so are prone to using heuristics. There are conflicting schools of thought as to whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Experienced decision-makers are thought to be more effective at using heuristics, so it is possible that for the political elite with experience in a particular context, heuristic decision-making is appropriate. Yet, many politicians are asked to make decisions on matters about which they are not experts. To add to the debate, we facilitated a discussion with a highly experienced cohort of 21 current and former senior politicians, former advisers, and current and former senior bureaucrats. When presented with a carefully considered and innovative new transport network pricing policy, we sought to identify whether and, if so, how they used heuristics to make a decision. We found that they used heuristics (1) to decide whether to engage with the issue at all and (2) how to act, having made the decision to engage. We describe how these heuristics were used and discuss the implications for theory and public administration practice.Points for practitioners There is a growing body of evidence that the political elite use heuristics for decision-making and that the use of heuristics is influenced by seven factors. We gained rare access to the political elite deciding on a politically risky issue and observed not only which heuristics they used, but how they used them. We observed a three-step decision tree, incorporating the 'wait-and-see' heuristic being used to decide whether to act, and political empathy, or intuiting voter heuristics to help decide how to act. We outline five options for public administrators who think that the political elite are using heuristics inappropriately for decision-making.",2024
A New Procedure for Discriminating Between Long Memory and Shifting Means Alternatives,"It is now recognized that long memory and structural change can easily be confused because the statistical properties of times series of lengths typical of financial and econometric series are similar for both models. The implications of long memory models or short memory with breaks for the pricing of financial assets (e.g. options) have been studied by other authorities who have concluded the pricing is significantly different between the two classes of models. Option pricing is also of interest to regulatory authorities. Thus it is of interest both from a finance theory and regulatory point of view whether the data are generated by a true long memory process or by something else. We propose a new approach aimed at distinguishing between long memory and structural change. The approach, which utilizes the computational efficient methods based upon Atheoretical Regression Trees (ART), uses a null hypothesis of the data being a fractionally integrated series. It establishes through simulation the bivariate distribution of the fractional integration parameter, d, with regime length for simulated fractionally integrated series of given nominal d value and series length. Confidence intervals can be established empirically as contours on the simulated data. This bivariate distribution is then compared with the data for the time series under test. We apply these methods to the realized volatility series of 16 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 10 year period from the beginning of 1994 to the end 2003. We show that in these series the value of the fractional integration d parameter is not constant with time. Given that a constant d value is fundamental to the definition of a fractionally integrated process",2009
American options with stochastic dividends and volatility:: A nonparametric investigation,"In this paper, we consider American option contracts when the underlying asset has stochastic dividends and stochastic volatility. We provide a full discussion of the theoretical foundations of American option valuation and exercise boundaries. We show how they depend on the various sources of uncertainty which drive dividend rates and volatility, and derive equilibrium asset prices, derivative prices and optimal exercise boundaries in a general equilibrium model. The theoretical models identify the relevant factors underlying option prices but yield fairly complex expressions which are difficult to estimate. We therefore adopt a nonparametric approach in order to investigate the reduced forms suggested by the theory. Indeed, we use nonparametric methods to estimate call prices and exercise boundaries conditional on dividends and volatility. Since the latter is a latent process, we propose several approaches, notably using EGARCH filtered estimates, implied and historical volatilities. The nonparametric approach allows us to test whether call prices and exercise decisions are primarily driven by dividends, as has been advocated by Harvey and Whaley (1992a. Journal of Financial Economics 30, 33-73; 1992b. Journal of Futures Markets 12, 123-137) and Fleming and Whaley (1994. Journal of Finance 49, 215-236) for the OEX contract, or whether stochastic volatility complements dividend uncertainty. We find that dividends alone do not account for all aspects of option pricing and exercise decisions, suggesting a need to include stochastic volatility. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Comparison of the credit scoring models on PD estimation of US banks,"The paper is devoted to the estimation of the probability of default (PD) as a crucial parameter in risk management, rating estimation, pricing of credit derivatives and many others key financial fields. Particularly, in this paper we will estimate the PD of US banks by means of the statistical models, generally known as credit scoring models. First, in theoretical part, we will briefly introduce the two main categories of credit scoring models, which will be afterwards used in application part - linear discriminant analysis and regression models (linear regression, logit and probit). In the main part of the paper we will work with the sample of almost three hundreds of commercial US banks which will be separate into the groups of defaulted and non-defaulted banks on the basis of historical information. Subsequently, we will stepwise apply the mentioned above scoring models on this sample to derive several models for estimation of PD. Further we will discuss the drawbacks and advantages of the particular models and compare reached results.",2010
A dynamic equilibrium model for U-shaped pricing kernels,"This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium model that can provide a unified explanation for the stylized facts observed in stock index markets such as the fat tails of the risk-neutral return distribution relative to the physical distribution, negative expected returns on deep OTM call options and negative realized variance risk premiums. In particular, we focus on the U-shaped pricing kernel against the stock index return, which is closely related to the negative call returns. We assume that the stock index return follows a time-changed Levy process and that a representative investor has power utility over the aggregate consumption that forms a linear regression of the stock index return and its stochastic activity rate. This model offers a macroeconomic interpretation of the stylized facts from the perspective of the sensitivity of the activity rate and stock index return on aggregate consumption as well as the investor's risk aversion.",2018
Computation of estimates in segmented regression and a liquidity effect model,"Weighted least squares (WLS) estimation in segmented regression with multiple change points is considered. A computationally efficient algorithm for calculating the WLS estimate of a single change point is derived. Then, iterative methods of approximating the global solution of the multiple change-point problem based on estimating change points one-at-a-time are discussed. It is shown that these results can also be applied to a liquidity effect model in finance with multiple change points. The liquidity effect model we consider is a generalization of one proposed by Cetin et at. [2006. Pricing options in an extended Black Scholes economy with illiquidity: theory and empirical evidence. Rev. Financial Stud. 19, 493-529], allowing that the magnitude of liquidity effect depends on the size of a trade. Two data sets are used to illustrate these methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation/Regression Pricing Schemes for CVA Computations on CDO Tranches,"We devise simulation/regression numerical schemes for pricing the CVA on CDO tranches, where CVA stands for Credit Valuation Adjustment, or price correction accounting for the defaultability of a counterparty in an OTC derivatives transaction. This is done in the setup of a continuous-time Markov chain model of default times, in which dependence between credit names is represented by the possibility of simultaneous defaults. The main idea of this article is to perform the nonlinear regressions which are used for computing conditional expectations, in the time variable for a given state of the model, rather than in the space variables at a given time in diffusive setups. This idea is formalized as a lemma which is valid in any continuous-time Markov chain model. It is then implemented on the targeted application of CVA computations on CDO tranches.",2014
"RETRACTION: How does financialization affect functional income distribution? A theoretical clarification and empirical assessment (Retraction of Vol 15, Pg 853, 2017)",It is frequently asserted that financialization has contributed to the decline in the wage share. This article provides a theoretical clarification and a systematic empirical investigation. We identify four arguments for why financialization would affect the wage share: (a) a Political Economy approach focusing on the exit options of firms; (b) a mark-up pricing approach stressing the role of financial overhead costs for firms; (c) increased competition on capital markets and shareholder value orientation; and (d) the role of household debt in increasing workers' financial vulnerability and undermining their class consciousness. The article compiles a comprehensive set of empirical measures of financialization and uses it to test these hypotheses with a panel regression of 14 OECD countries over the 1989-2011 period. We find strong evidence for negative effects of household debt and evidence for negative effects of financial deregulation on the wage share.,2024
Implied volatility smirk and future stock returns: evidence from the German market,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between option's implied volatility smirk (IVS) and excess returns in the Germany's leading stock index Deutscher-Aktien Index (DAX) 30. Design/methodology/approach - The study defines the IVS as the difference in implied volatility derived from out-of-the-money put options and at-the-money call options. This study employs the ordinary least square regression with Newey-West correction to analyse the relationship between IVS and excess DAX 30 index returns in Germany. Findings - The authors find that the German market adjusts information in an efficient way. Consequently, there is no information linkage between option volatility smirk and market index returns over the nine years sample period after considering the control variables, global financial crisis dummies, and the subsample test. Research limitations/implications - This study finds that the option market and the DAX 30 index are informationally efficient. Implications of the findings are that the investors cannot profit from the information contained in the IVS since the information is simultaneously incorporated into option prices and the stock index prices. The findings of this study are applicable to other markets with European options and for market participants who seek to exploit short-term market divergence from efficiency. Originality/value - The relationship between IVS and stock price changes has not been investigated sufficiently in academic literature. This study looks at this relationship in the context of European options using high-frequency transactions data. Prior studies look at this relationship for only American options using daily data. Pricing efficiency of the European option market using highfrequency data have not been studied in the prior literature. The authors find different results for the German market based on this high-frequency data set.",2015
Evolving Fuzzy-GARCH Approach for Financial Volatility Modeling and Forecasting,"Volatility modeling and forecasting play a key role in asset allocation, risk management, derivatives pricing and policy making. The purpose of this paper is to develop an evolving fuzzy-GARCH modeling approach for stock market asset returns forecasting. The method addresses GARCH volatility modeling within the framwork of evolving fuzzy systems. This hybrid methodology aims to account for time-varying volatility, from GARCH approach, as well as volatility clustering and nonlinear time series identification, from evolving fuzzy systems, which use time-varying data streams to continuously and simultaneously adapt the structure and functionality of fuzzy models. The motivation is to improve model performance as new data is input through gradual model construction, inducing model adaptation and refinement without catastrophic forgetting while keeping current model useful. An empirical application includes the forecasting of S&P 500 and Ibovespa indexes by the evolving fuzzy-GARCH against traditional GARCH-family models and a fuzzy GJR-GARCH methodology. The results indicate the high potential of the evolving fuzzy-GARCH model to forecast stock returns volatility, which outperforms GARCH-type models and showed comparable forecasts with fuzzy GJR-GARCH methodology.",2016
An augmented Lagrangian method with constraint generation for shape-constrained convex regression problems,"Shape-constrained convex regression problem deals with fitting a convex function to the observed data, where additional constraints are imposed, such as component-wise monotonicity and uniform Lipschitz continuity. This paper provides a unified framework for computing the least squares estimator of a multivariate shape-constrained convex regression function in R-d. We prove that the least squares estimator is computable via solving an essentially constrained convex quadratic programming (QP) problem with (d + 1)n variables, n(n - 1) linear inequality constraints and n possibly non-polyhedral inequality constraints, where n is the number of data points. To efficiently solve the generally very large-scale convex QP, we design a proximal augmented Lagrangian method (proxALM) whose subproblems are solved by the semismooth Newton method. To further accelerate the computation when n is huge, we design a practical implementation of the constraint generation method such that each reduced problem is efficiently solved by our proposed proxALM. Comprehensive numerical experiments, including those in the pricing of basket options and estimation of production functions in economics, demonstrate that our proposed proxALM outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and the proposed acceleration technique further shortens the computation time by a large margin.",2022
A comparison of temperature density forecasts from GARCH and atmospheric models,"Density forecasts for weather variables are useful for the many industries exposed to weather risk. Weather ensemble predictions are generated from atmospheric models and consist of multiple future scenarios for a weather variable. The distribution of the scenarios can be used as a density forecast, which is needed for pricing weather derivatives. We consider one to 10-day-ahead density forecasts provided by temperature ensemble predictions. More specifically, we evaluate forecasts of the mean and quantiles of the density. The mean of the ensemble scenarios is the most accurate forecast for the mean of the density. We use quantile regression to debias the quantiles of the distribution of the ensemble scenarios. The resultant quantile forecasts compare favourably with those from a GARCH model. These results indicate the strong potential for the use of ensemble prediction in temperature density forecasting.

Estimating assortment size effects on platforms: Leveraging imperfect geographic targeting for causal inference,"Customers of two-sided platforms may succumb to choice overload due to the frequently overwhelming assortment in such markets. We investigate the effect of assortment size on consumers' purchase probability using a unique click-stream dataset from a large peer-to-peer meal delivery platform. To resolve the key endogeneity challenge that assortment size may be larger in areas where consumers experience greater utility from purchase, we introduce a novel causal inference strategy that exploits a common but imperfect geographic targeting tool employed by the platform: limiting kitchens to a set of fixed delivery radii. We argue and show through simulation exercises that true assortment size effects on purchase probability can be estimated when we employ clustering algorithms to recover and account for neighborhoods that may be targeted by suppliers. Applying our causal inference strategy to the home-cooked delivery setting, we find that purchase rate effects of assortment size are rapidly diminishing. In fact, our findings suggest that up to 18% of active users experience choice overload. These effects persist despite accounting for potential pricing, assortment variety, and personalization confounds and are robust to nonparametric specifications and accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in assortment effects. We further document the novel moderating role of new-to-user and off-platform options on assortment size effects.",2023
Improvized implied volatility function and nonparametric approach to unbiased estimation,"The purpose of this paper is to assess unbiased options pricing predictions via ad hoc Black-Scholes model approaches. This paper investigates a number of technical issues when fitted values of implied volatility from linear regression are plugged into the Black-Scholes model, which leads to biased estimation. First, the study observes that the implied volatility linear regression can yield a negative outcome, which is meaningless. Therefore, a logarithmic transformation is applied to the linear function to ensure that the forecast is positive. Second, the retransformation from log to original metric to fitted values of implied volatility and the nonlinearity of Black-Scholes to implied volatility yields biased forecasts. A smearing technique has been applied in this study to correct this bias. Finally, the smearing estimation method also provides biased results if there is heteroscedasticity in the OLS estimation residuals. This study applies the weighted least square regression technique in order to avoid heteroscedasticity. According to the performance measures such as mean bias (MB), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute relative error, the study concludes that the smearing method is the most effective to correct the bias in ad hoc Black-Scholes approaches as well as that an absolute smile approach is better than a relative smile approach without the smearing technique, but with smearing methods, relative smile performs superior to absolute.",2023
Capital investment appraisal for the integration of new technology into mining systems,"New technologies have been widely recognized as the key to the achievement of competitiveness in the mining industry, enabling costs and environmental impact to be reduced while increasing safety, flexibility and productivity. Research has been undertaken with industry to develop management approaches for appraisal of the integration of new technology into mining systems. The traditional capital investment appraisal (CIA) methods currently used in the mining industry are reviewed and their development and limitations are examined. Reference is made to how technologies affect mining operations-often bringing benefits in 'soft' or qualitative forms. A new CIA classification scheme is presented that aims to assist in the selection of the appropriate CIA method, according to the type of technology and the mining situation. A review of the theory underlying three particular CIA methods that are considered to offer significant potential-activity-based costing, options pricing and the Analytical Hierarchy Process-is accompanied by case studies to illustrate their application to technology integration in mining operations. A concluding discussion of new technology integration emphasizes the need for greater awareness of appraisal issues and methods.",2000
Secondary school canteens in Australia: analysis of canteen menus from a repeated cross-sectional national survey,"Objective: The current study aimed to assess the nutritional quality of Australian secondary school canteen menus. Design: Stratified national samples of schools provided canteenmenus in 2012-2013 and 2018, which were systematically assessed against a 'traffic light' classification system according to the National Healthy School Canteen Guidelines. Items were classified as green (healthiest and recommended to dominate canteen menus), amber (select carefully) or red (lownutritional quality, should not appear on canteen menus), and pricing and promotional strategies were recorded. Setting: Australia. Participants: Canteen menus from 244 secondary schools (2012-2013 n 148, 2018 n 96). Results: A total of 21 501 menu items were classified. Forty-nine percent of canteen menus contained at least 50% green items; however, nearly all (98.5%) offered at least one red item and therefore did not comply with national recommendations. Snacks and drinks had the least healthy profile of all product sectors, and a large proportion of schools supplied products typically of poor nutritional quality (meat pies and savoury pastries 91.8 %, sugary drinks 89.5 %, sweet baked goods 71.5%, ice creams 64.1% and potato chips 44.0 %). Red items were significantly cheaper than green items on average, andmany schools promoted the purchase of red items on canteen menus (52.8%). There were few differences between survey waves. Conclusions: There is considerable room for improvement in the nutritional quality of canteen menus in Australian secondary schools, including in the availability, pricing and promotion of healthier options. Additional resources and services to support implementation of national guidelines would be beneficial.",2021
Testing of warrants market efficiency on the Warsaw stock exchange - Classical approach,"The efficiency of different markets was a subject of research by plenty of analysts. Most market research on the derivatives market was concentrated on valuation, but only a little part was concentrated on market efficiency. The goal of this article is to provide an empirical test of efficiency of the warrants quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. One of the approaches of the derivatives' market efficiency testing is researching a relationship between implied and historical volatility. The efficient market hypothesis assumes that volatility prediction, which is build on the sign from market, its named implied volatility, could be estimator of empirical volatility in the future, named historical volatility. Using standard procedures for estimating regression line by the OLS and for verification of econometric models, researchers could conclude about rejection or the lack of bases' disallowable the hypotheses' about market efficiency. The research includes testing weak and strong efficiency. There are two ways of testing the warrants market efficiency in the paper. The first approach includes empirical tests based on the following stages: 1. The calculation of underlying assets' historical volatility. 2. The estimation of implied volatility from warrants prices. 3. Verification of hypothesis. The second approach consists in comparing the actual warrants prices and the estimated prices generated from the Black-Scholes pricing model.",2005
Determination of the adequate capital for default protection under the one-factor Gaussian term structure model,"In practice, credit risk is measured by one of the two different methodologies. One measures the prices and sensitivities of the credit linked instruments. Another measures the required collateral or capital needed to cover a potential default loss. This paper introduces a pricing methodology, which also determines the required capital. Conventionally the value-at-risk method is used to determine collateral requirements. Artzner et al. demonstrated that the resulting adequate capital measures may fail to capture the credit diversification effect, which is critical in credit risk management. (cf Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J.-M., Heath, D. 1997. Definition of coherent measures of risk. Paper presented at the Symposium on Risk Management, European Finance Association, Vienna, August 27-30). In order to overcome this problem, this paper introduces a new approach, which combines closed form solutions and the Hull-White trinomial tree. This combined approach is computationally faster than a naively implemented Monte-Carlo-based VAR methodology. The pricing model is based on the rating-based Gaussian term structure model developed by Nakazato. This approach is applicable to a wide variety of credit derivatives and their portfolios in a coherent fashion. In this paper, however, attention is concentrated on determining the collateral requirement for the counter party risk when there is the risk of credit rating change on an issue and also risk of default on that issue or on any protection already written on the issue.

Forecasting temperature to price CME temperature derivatives,"This paper seeks to forecast temperatures in US cities in order to price temperature derivatives on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME defines the average daily temperature underlying its contracts as the average of the maximum and minimum daily temperatures, yet all published work on temperature forecasting for pricing purposes has ignored this peculiar definition of the average and sought to model the average temperature directly. This paper is the first to look at the average temperature forecasting problem as an analysis of extreme values. The theory of extreme values guides model selection for temperature maxima and minima, and a forecast distribution for the CME's daily average temperature is found through convolution. While univariate time series AR-GARCH and regression models generally yield superior point forecasts of temperatures, our extreme-value-based model consistently outperforms these models in density forecasting, the most important risk management tool.

"Market segmentation and willingness to pay for public transport annual passes among older adults: insights from Genoa, Italy","A survey of older adults aged 65 and over (n = 247) was conducted in Genoa, often described as 'the oldest city in the oldest country' in Europe. This paper presents two scenarios exploring older people's willingness to pay (WTP) for annual tickets for local public transport (LPT) and examines the impact of factors such as cost, time, and comfort. These insights could help address the challenges of travel in ageing societies. A segmentation analysis based on the mean values of the two WTP scenarios (status quo and improved services) was conducted, followed by linear regression modelling to understand how older adults' socio-demographic traits, perceptions, and travel behaviour affect their WTP. Our findings suggest that the pricing of the annual pass (345 at the time of survey) exceeds the WTP indicated by respondents. The mean WTP for the status quo level of service (221.36) was much lower than the WTP if service levels were improved (304.07). Women were found to be more likely to use LPT but also tended to live alone and have lower incomes. Off-peak hours, particularly in the afternoon, were also associated with a higher WTP. This research is important in the context of Europe's ageing population, highlighting the need for more inclusive transport options for older adults. Public transport authorities (PTAs) should explore more tailored approaches to pricing and service provision. It is imperative to balance the competing goals of cost recovery, equity, and service attractiveness to encourage older people's uptake of LPT services, while maintaining accessibility and wellbeing.",2025
QUANTILE CLOCKS,"Quantile clocks are defined as convolutions of subordinators L, with quantile functions of positive random variables. We show that quantile clocks can be chosen to be strictly increasing and continuous and discuss their practical modeling advantages as business activity times in models for asset prices. We show that the marginal distributions of a quantile clock, at each fixed time, equate with the marginal distribution of a single subordinator. Moreover, we show that there are many quantile clocks where one can specify L, such that their marginal distributions have a desired law in the class of generalized s-self decomposable distributions, and in particular the class of self-decomposable distributions. The development of these results involves elements of distribution theory for specific classes of infinitely divisible random variables and also decompositions of a gamma subordinator, that is of independent interest. As applications, we construct many price models that have continuous trajectories, exhibit volatility clustering and have marginal distributions that are equivalent to those of quite general exponential Levy price models. In particular, we provide explicit details for continuous processes whose marginals equate with the popular VG, CGMY and NIG price models. We also show how to perfectly sample the marginal distributions of more general classes of convoluted subordinators when L is in a sub-class of generalized gamma convolutions, which is relevant for pricing of European style options.",2011
Modeling the Price of Natural Gas with Temperature and Oil Price as Exogenous Factors,"The literature on stochastic models for the spot market of gas is dominated by purely stochastic approaches. In contrast to these models, Stoll and Wiebauer [14] propose a fundamental model with temperature as an exogenous factor. A model containing only deterministic, temperature-dependent and purely stochastic components, however, still seems not able to capture economic influences on the price. In order to improve the model of Stoll and Wiebauer [ 14], we include the oil price as another exogenous factor. There are at least two fundamental reasons why this should improve the model. First, the oil price can be considered as a proxy for the general state of the world economy. Furthermore, pricing formulas in oil price indexed gas import contracts in Central Europe are covered by the oil price component. It is shown that the new model can explain price movements of the last few years much better than previous models. The inclusion of oil price and temperature in the regression of a least squares Monte Carlo method leads to more realistic valuation results for gas storages and swing options.",2015
Future portfolio returns and the VIX term structure,"The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) and VIXbased risk measures, such as the variance risk premium, are predictors for future portfolio returns. In addition to the current level of the squared VIX and its changes over past periods (as previously identified by Banerjee and coworkers), the differential of expectations about future risk as indicated by the difference between long-horizon and short-horizon VIX indexes is another relevant pricing factor. We use the difference between the CBOE Standard & Poor's 500 six-month and nine-day volatility indexes (the long-minus-short implied volatility measure) to proxy this risk differential. This measure captures how risk is expected to evolve and is thus directly related to the VIX term structure. Including it in a predictive portfolio regression model improves the fit by approximately two basis points in terms of the adjusted R2. The results hold for various portfolio sortings (industry, book-to-market, size) and over different sample periods. Overall, the results support the notion that volatility risk has multiple facets that are priced individually.",2022
Taste and value: Exploring sensory acceptance and willingness-to-pay for convenient farm-raised catfish products through experimental auction,"Gaining insights into consumer perceptions of newly developed food products is essential for enhancing their success in the marketplace, as it allows for refining products to align with evolving consumer preferences and aids in the formulation of effective marketing and pricing strategies. This study examines consumer insights for four newly developed, convenient, and healthy U.S. farm-raised catfish products using sensory evaluations and consumer willingness to pay (WTP) elicited through Vickrey's second-price experimental auction. Using Elastic Net (EN) regularized regression, we identified key sensory and demographic attributes affecting consumer preference and WTP. Results indicate that consumers favor these catfish products over similar market options, with taste emerging as the most significant sensory attribute driving WTP, followed by texture and smell. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, education, gender, and race significantly impacted WTP. We also evaluated the suitability of the organoleptic attributes for each product, providing recommendations for improvement where needed. This research supports product reformulation and marketing strategies and offers valuable insights for future seafood product development initiatives.",2025
Differences among OECD countries' GHG emissions: Causes and policy implications,"This article assesses the reasons for observed differences in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among high-income OECD countries. Nine factors were tested: climate, population pressure (measured as both growth and density), economic output per capita, technological development, industrial structure, energy prices, environmental governance, pollution abatement and control expenditures, and environmental pricing. Based on a series of regression analyses, three factors - energy prices, economic output per capita, and environmental governance - were identified as the most important factors for explaining differences in OECD per capita GHG emissions. Combined, these three factors explain about 81% of the variation observed in OECD per capita GHG emissions. Individually, energy prices explains about 55% of the variation in per capita GHG emissions, while economic output per capita explains about 19%, and environmental governance about 7%. These findings show that behavioural choices based on existing technologies, rather than exogenous factors such as climate, determine differences in GHG emissions and, therefore, policy options to change behaviour such as increasing energy prices and other regulatory changes have the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions.

A reduced-order model based on cubic B-spline basis function and SSP Runge-Kutta procedure to investigate option pricing under jump-diffusion models,"The purpose of this research is to develop a numerical method that can be used to deal with option pricing in jump-diffusion models. The proposed model is made up of a backward partial integro-differential equation with diffusion and advection factors. For the first and second order derivatives, the pseudo-spectral technique is used in conjunction with cubic B-spline functions. As a consequence, the first-and second-order derivative matrices are constructed, and an ODE system is created. Second-order Strong Stability Preserved Runge-Kutta (SSP) procedure is used to solve the ODE problem. According to what has been stated, the main model falls under the advection-diffusion classification. As a result, in order to reach the ultimate time, we need to increase both the number of collocations and the number of time steps in order to improve our results. That is why the final algebraic system of equations has been condensed using a technique known as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The POD-cubic B-Spline (POD-CB-S) function collocation approach can be used to describe this numerical procedure. Finally, a number of test cases are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method's efficiency and accuracy.",2023
Determinants of orphan drugs prices in France: a regression analysis,"Background: The introduction of the orphan drug legislation led to the increase in the number of available orphan drugs, but the access to them is often limited due to the high price. Social preferences regarding funding orphan drugs as well as the criteria taken into consideration while setting the price remain unclear. The study aimed at identifying the determinant of orphan drug prices in France using a regression analysis. Methods: All drugs with a valid orphan designation at the moment of launch for which the price was available in France were included in the analysis. The selection of covariates was based on a literature review and included drug characteristics (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) class, treatment line, age of target population), diseases characteristics (severity, prevalence, availability of alternative therapeutic options), health technology assessment (HTA) details (actual benefit (AB) and improvement in actual benefit (IAB) scores, delay between the HTA and commercialisation), and study characteristics (type of study, comparator, type of endpoint). The main data sources were European public assessment reports, HTA reports, summaries of opinion on orphan designation of the European Medicines Agency, and the French insurance database of drugs and tariffs. A generalized regression model was developed to test the association between the annual treatment cost and selected covariates. Results: A total of 68 drugs were included. The mean annual treatment cost was (sic)96,518. In the univariate analysis, the ATC class (p = 0.01), availability of alternative treatment options (p = 0.02) and the prevalence (p = 0.02) showed a significant correlation with the annual cost. The multivariate analysis demonstrated significant association between the annual cost and availability of alternative treatment options, ATC class, IAB score, type of comparator in the pivotal clinical trial, as well as commercialisation date and delay between the HTA and commercialisation. Conclusion: The orphan drug pricing is a multivariate phenomenon. The complex association between drug prices and the studied attributes and shows that payers integrate multiple variables in decision making when setting orphan drug prices. The interpretation of the study results is limited by the small sample size and the complex data structure.",2017
A Modified Reduced-Form Model with Time-Varying Default and Recovery Rates and Its Applications in Pricing Convertible Bonds,"Due to the lack of proper credit derivatives and opaque financial status of a reference entity, it is difficult to accurately estimate recovery rates in reducedform models. In addition, most reduced-form models adopt a constant recovery rate assumption that fails to capture the time-varying dynamics and inverse relationships between recovery and default rates found in empirical studies. Most revisions that incorporate this inverse relationship require strict calibration procedures or limit the wide applicability of reducedform models due to introducing complexity models involving stochastic processes. The authors propose a notion of the expected recovery rate conditional on the default rate by combining a regression relationship between these two rates and a transformation between default rates under the physical and riskneutral measures. This notion can be simply incorporated into any reduced-form model to simultaneously produce reliable time-varying recovery and default rates. To demonstrate their idea, they revise Jarrow and Turnbull's [1995] reduced-form model used in Chambers and Lu [2007] for pricing convertible bonds. The resulting tree structure is also adjusted to alleviate the infeasible branching probability problem.",2017
On the usefulness of risk-neutral distribution implied in the KOSPI 200 index option,"This study investigates the usefulness of the risk-neutral distributions implied in the KOSPI 200 index options in the view of hedging. Specifically, using an adjusted implied volatility interpolation method, we infer the risk-neutral distributions of the underlying asset implied in the KOSPI 200 index (out-of-the-money only and all) options market prices in both downward and rising trends from January 2, 2003 to December 30, 2003. Then, we compare the delta-neutral and delta-vega hedging performances of implied distribution with those of Black-Scholes which assume single lognormal distribution and those of the ad hoc black-Scholes procedure that fit the implied volatility surface. To accurately investigate the cause of the different hedging performances among the models, additional empirical tests are performed: firstly, we conduct a comparative analysis of delta-vega hedging performances using post-inferred implied correlation coefficient and of the adjusted R-2 of vega hedging using post-inferred regression equations among models. Secondly, we make a comparison between the hedging performances in SIV that synthesize out-of-the-money call and put options only and those of IV that use all call (put) options through the change of the number of deep in(out-of)-the-money option's data divided by the number of all options' data occurred owing to the downward (rising) trend of the underlying asset price. Then, we analyze whether the downward (rising) trend of. the underlying asset price influences relative hedging performances among the models used in this study. The empirical results are summarized as follow: in the view of hedgers who search for a perfect hedging method, in the case of call options, SIV and IV are better choices. In comparison of SIV and IV, SIV is better than IV in the event of increase in the number of deep-in-the-money options, rather than that of deep-out-of-the-money options because IV offers more advantage than IV does, by using additionally deep-out-of-the-money call or put options for the hedging of put or call options. IV merely reflects information implied in deep-in-the-money options for hedging all options including deep-in-the-money options. Therefore, SIV (IV) is the best choice as a hedging strategy in the short term for the period of the rising (downward) trend of the underlying asset price, but there is no significant difference between IV and SIV in the long term. In the case of put options, BS is a significantly better choice in the long term as delta-vega hedging method due to its stability of pricing errors (or, at least, strongly serially dependent as suits a specification error) and accurate vegas unlike the less parsimonious models.

Alcohol policy changes during the first three-months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Development and application of a classification scheme,"Background: Policy changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted on alcohol control. This study describes the development and application of a classification scheme to map alcohol policy changes during the first three -months of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries and/or subnational jurisdictions. Method: A pre -registered systematic review of policy decisions from March to May 2020, in Australia/New South Wales, Canada/Ontario, Chile, Italy and the United Kingdom. One author extracted the data for each jurisdiction using a country -specific search strategy of government documents. We coded policy changes using an adapted WHO classification scheme, whether the policy was expected to tighten or loosen alcohol control, have mainly immediate or delayed impact on consumption and harm and impact the general population versus specific populations. We present descriptive statistics of policy change. Results: We developed a classification scheme with four levels. Existing policy options were insufficient to capture policy changes in alcohol availability, thus we added seventeen new sub -categories. We found 114 alcohol control policies introduced across the five jurisdictions, covering five (out of ten) WHO action areas. The majority aimed to change alcohol availability, by regulating the operation of alcohol outlets. All countries introduced closures to on -premise alcohol outlets and, except Chile, allowed off -sales via take away or home delivery. We also observed several pricing policies introducing subsidies to support the alcohol industry. Seventy-four percent of policy changes were expected to tighten alcohol control and 12.3 % to weaken control. Weakening policy changes were mostly related to retail mode switching or expansion (allowing take away or home delivery). Conclusion: Alcohol control policies during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic were targeted primarily at alcohol availability and about one tenth might weaken alcohol control.

Higher Order Kernel Mean Embeddings to Capture Filtrations of Stochastic Processes,"Stochastic processes are random variables with values in some space of paths. However, reducing a stochastic process to a path-valued random variable ignores its filtration, i.e. the flow of information carried by the process through time. By conditioning the process on its filtration, we introduce a family of higher order kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) that generalizes the notion of KME and captures additional information related to the filtration. We derive empirical estimators for the associated higher order maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) and prove consistency. We then construct a filtration-sensitive kernel two-sample test able to pick up information that gets missed by the standard MMD test. In addition, leveraging our higher order MMDs we construct a family of universal kernels on stochastic processes that allows to solve real-world calibration and optimal stopping problems in quantitative finance (such as the pricing of American options) via classical kernel-based regression methods. Finally, adapting existing tests for conditional independence to the case of stochastic processes, we design a causaldiscovery algorithm to recover the causal graph of structural dependencies among interacting bodies solely from observations of their multidimensional trajectories.",2021
Data Intelligence in Public Transportation: Sustainable and Equitable Solutions to Urban Modals in Strategic Digital City Subproject,"Transport infrastructure investments must be linked to the public transport demand strategically. User behavior and decision-making process bring several possible alternative transportation options due to a series of factors that define it. Municipalities must manage these factors to promote equal and sustainable transport solutions through urban infrastructure, public transport competitiveness, and attractiveness, and fossil fuels use and pricing policy. The research objective is to determine these factors to monitor and use them for citizens' benefit by means of analytical tools and methods to gain a superior knowledge of reality with a focus on improving investments and services in an agile and efficient manner. Methodologically, the number of passengers of main Curitiba's (Brazil) bus rapid transit (BRT) lines is operated in two linear regression models combined with the number of private vehicles, public transport fare, and fuel price for the period between January/2010 and December/2019. Research analysis indicates direct causal relationships between the studied factors and that the necessary data for decision-making is available in the government information systems. In conclusion, urban management and strategic digital city project can be more balanced and assertive in transport infrastructure investments and citizen services provision.",2022
Exploring the impact of input variables on option value: a study using experimental design and analysis techniques,"The Black Scholes Model (BSM), a well-known approach for determining the fair value of options, has a long history. The price of the underlying asset, the strike price, volatility, time period, interest rates, and dividend yields are several of the input variables that have an impact on option pricing. This study intends to investigate the effects of these variables on option values. Taguchi's methodology of design of the experiment is used for the experimental setup and to optimize the factors for option values. Taguchi method L27 design of experiment (DOE), analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, and analysis of means (ANOM) were used to investigate the effects of these input parameters on option values. MINITAB 18 software is used to carry out the analysis. The factors, in order of their significance from highest to lowest, were identified as: strike price, time period, interest rate, underlying asset price, volatility and dividend concerning to call option value for the given dataset. This technique can be used by traders to determine how various factors impact option values. The proportion contribution of these factors to the call values is also quantified using ANOVA.",2024
"American options under stochastic volatility: control variates, maturity randomization & multiscale asymptotics","American options are actively traded worldwide on exchanges, thus making their accurate and efficient pricing an important problem. As most financial markets exhibit randomly varying volatility, in this paper we introduce an approximation of an American option price under stochastic volatility models. We achieve this by using the maturity randomization method known as Canadization. The volatility process is characterized by fast and slow-scale fluctuating factors. In particular, we study the case of an American put with a single underlying asset and use perturbative expansion techniques to approximate its price as well as the optimal exercise boundary up to the first order. We then use the approximate optimal exercise boundary formula to price an American put via Monte Carlo. We also develop efficient control variates for our simulation method using martingales resulting from the approximate price formula. A numerical study is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the least squares regression method popular in the financial industry, in typical settings where values of the scaling parameters are small. Further, it is empirically observed that in the regimes where the scaling parameter value is equal to unity, fast and slow-scale approximations are equally accurate.",2016
Price Discovery Mechanism in Unified Market Platform (UMP): A Case Study of APMC Raichur,"The study attempted to analyze how prices were discovered under the e-tending method in the Raichur market, Karnataka, during 2017-18.Correlation, multiple regression and Gini concentration ratio were used to analyse data.The major findings of the study include the e-tendering system under UMP had considerable potential to infuse competition and fetch better prices for farmers; the pricing mechanism of paddy showed there was a clear indication if one bid increases for a lot, there was a 13.8 per cent increase in the price, the numbers of bids per lot and lot size had a positive effect; moisture content had a negative impact on the price of paddy. The study suggested the policy options were: market performance has improved under UMP, so the scope for expansion of e-trading in other markets in Karnataka as well as India, there is a need to create awareness among farmers about to follow quality parameters according to UMP guidelines, and Government needs to strengthen the infrastructure for assaying of agricultural commodities at farm level or community level; Strengthen the IT infrastructure for resolving all UMP related queries of stakeholders in a single window.",2022
Machine learning computational tools to assist the performance of systematic reviews: A mapping review,"Background: Within evidence-based practice (EBP), systematic reviews (SR) are considered the highest level of evidence in that they summarize the best available research and describe the progress in a determined field. Due its methodology, SR require significant time and resources to be performed; they also require repetitive steps that may introduce biases and human errors. Machine learning (ML) algorithms therefore present a promising alternative and a potential game changer to speed up and automate the SR process. This review aims to map the current availability of computational tools that use ML techniques to assist in the performance of SR, and to support authors in the selection of the right software for the performance of evidence synthesis. Methods: The mapping review was based on comprehensive searches in electronic databases and software repositories to obtain relevant literature and records, followed by screening for eligibility based on titles, abstracts, and full text by two reviewers. The data extraction consisted of listing and extracting the name and basic characteristics of the included tools, for example a tool's applicability to the various SR stages, pricing options, open-source availability, and type of software. These tools were classified and graphically represented to facilitate the description of our findings. Results: A total of 9653 studies and 585 records were obtained from the structured searches performed on selected bibliometric databases and software repositories respectively. After screening, a total of 119 descriptions from publications and records allowed us to identify 63 tools that assist the SR process using ML techniques. Conclusions: This review provides a high-quality map of currently available ML software to assist the performance of SR. ML algorithms are arguably one of the best techniques at present for the automation of SR. The most promising tools were easily accessible and included a high number of user-friendly features permitting the automation of SR and other kinds of evidence synthesis reviews.",2022
Return-volatility relationships in cryptocurrency markets: Evidence from asymmetric quantiles and non-linear ARDL approach,"Implied volatility has consistently demonstrated its reliability as a superior estimator of the expected short-term volatility of underlying assets. In this study, we employ the newly constructed robust model-free implied volatility (MFIV) indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum (BitVol and EthVol) to explore the asymmetric return-volatility relationship of these cryptocurrencies through the lens of behavioral finance theories. Utilizing the asymmetric quantile regression model (QRM) and the Non-linear ARDL (NARDL) approach, our results reveal a notable difference from equities. Both positive and negative return shocks in the cryptocurrency market lead to an increase in volatility. However, during high volatility regimes, positive (negative) return shocks exert a more substantial impact on positive innovations of volatility for Bitcoin (Ethereum) compared to negative (positive) return shocks. The degree of asymmetry steadily intensifies as we progress from medium to uppermost quantiles of the volatility distribution. These observed phenomena can be attributed to behavioral aspects among market participants, including noise trading, behavioral biases, and fear of missing out (FOMO). Our findings hold significant implications for various aspects of cryptocurrency trading, portfolio hedging strategies, volatility derivatives pricing, and risk management.",2023
"Financial Risk Management and Explainable, Trustworthy, Responsible AI","This perspective paper is based on several sessions by the members of the Round Table AI at FIRM1, with input from a number of external and international speakers. Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production. In view of the recent EU publication on AI, also referred to as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), we also see a certain added value for this paper as an instigator of further thinking outside of the financial services sector, in particular where High Risk  models according to the mentioned EU consultation are concerned.",2022
A strategy for forecasting option prices using fuzzy time series and least square support vector regression with a bootstrap model,"Recently, the strategy for forecasting option price has become a popular financial topic because options are important tools on risk management in financial investments. The well-known Black-Scholes model (B-S model) is widely used for option pricing. In B-S model, the normal distribution assumption is important. However, the financial data in real life may not follow the normal distribution assumption. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model, which is a nonlinear prediction model without normal distribution assumptions to forecast the option prices. The proposed model is composed of a Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) model, a Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR), and a bootstrap method. In the proposed model, FTS model is firstly used to fuzzify dataset and to build historical database. Subsequently, the proposed method uses the remainder contractual time to search similar historical trends as training samples. Finally, we use the bootstrap method on LSSVR to enhance the prediction accuracy. The experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional time series models and several hybrid models in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the correlation coefficient (r) of actual and forecasted option price.

Crowdkeeping in Last-Mile Delivery,"In order to improve the efficiency of the last -mile delivery system when customers are possibly absent for deliveries, we propose the idea of employing the crowd to work as keepers and to provide storage services for their neighbors. Crowd keepers have extra flexibility, more availability, and lower costs than fixed storage options such as automated lockers, and this leads to a more efficient and a more profitable system for last -mile deliveries. We present a bilevel program that jointly determines the assignment, routing, and pricing decisions while considering customer preferences, keeper behaviors, and platform operations. We develop an equivalent single -level program, a mixed -integer linear program with subtour elimination constraints, that can be solved to optimality using a row generation algorithm. To improve the efficiency of the solution procedure, we further derive exact best response sets for both customers and keepers, and approximate optimal travel times using linear regression. We present a numerical study using a real -world data set from Amazon. The fixed -storage and no -storage systems are used as benchmarks to assess the performance of the crowdkeeping system. The results show that the crowdkeeping delivery system has the potential to generate higher profits because of its ability to consolidate deliveries and to eliminate failed deliveries.",2024
ON PROPERTIES OF ANALYTICALLY SOLVABLE FAMILIES OF LOCAL VOLATILITY DIFFUSION MODELS,"We present some further developments in the construction and classification of new solvable one-dimensional diffusion models having transition densities, and other quantities that are fundamental to derivatives pricing, representable in analytically closed form. Our approach is based on so-called diffusion canonical transformations that produce a large class of multiparameter nonlinear local volatility diffusion models that are mapped onto various simpler diffusions. Using an asymptotic analysis, we arrive at a rigorous boundary classification as well as a characterization with respect to probability conservation and the martingale property of the newly constructed diffusions. Specifically, we analyze and classify in detail four main families of driftless regular diffusion models that arise from the underlying squared Bessel process (the Bessel family), CoxIngersollRoss process (the confluent hypergeometric family), the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion (the OU family), and the Jacobi diffusion (the hypergeometric family). We show that the Bessel family is a superset of the constant elasticity of variance model without drift. The Bessel family, in turn, is nested by the confluent hypergeometric family. For these two families we find further subfamilies of conservative strict supermartingales and nonconservative martingales with an exit boundary. For the new classes of nonconservative regular diffusions we also derive analytically exact first exit time densities that are given in terms of generalized inverse Gaussians and extensions. As for the two other new models, we show that the OU family of processes are conservative strict martingales, whereas the Jacobi family are nonconservative nonmartingales. Considered as asset price diffusion models, we also show that these models demonstrate a wide range of local volatility shapes and option implied volatility surfaces that include various pronounced skew and smile patterns.",2012
PSECMAC: A novel self-organizing multiresolution associative memory architecture,"The cerebellum constitutes a vital part of the human brain system that possesses the capability to model highly nonlinear physical dynamics. The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) associative memory network is a computational model inspired by the neurophysiological properties of the cerebellum, and it has been widely used for control, optimization, and various pattern recognition tasks. However, the CMAC network's highly regularized computing structure often leads to the Following: 1) a suboptimal modeling accuracy, 2) poor memory utilization, and 3) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Previous attempts to address these shortcomings have limited success and the proposed solutions often introduce a high operational complexity to the CMAC network. This paper presents a novel neurophysiologically inspired associative memory architecture named pseudo-self-evolving CMAC (PSECMAC) that nonuniformly allocates its computing cells to overcome the architectural deficiencies encountered by the CMAC network. The nonuniform memory allocation scheme employed by the proposed PSECMAC network is inspired by the cerebellar experience-driven synaptic plasticity phenomenon observed in the cerebellum, where significantly higher densities of synaptic connections are located in the frequently accessed regions. In the PSECMAC network, this biological synaptic plasticity phenomenon is emulated by employing a data-driven adaptive memory quantization scheme that defines its computing structure. A neighborhood-based activation process is subsequently implemented to facilitate the learning and computation of the PSECMAC structure. The training stability of the PSECMAC network is theoretically assured by the proof of its learning convergence, which will be presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently bench-marked against the CMAC network and several representative CMAC variants on three real-life applications, namely, pricing of currency futures option, banking failure classification, and modeling of the glucose-insulin dynamics of the human glucose metabolic process. The experimental results have strongly demonstrated the effectiveness of the PSECMAC network in addressing the architectural deficiencies of (he CMAC network by achieving significant improvements in the memory utilization, output accuracy its well as the generalization capability of the network.",2008
Risk Structure of Banks in Spain: Do BHCs Have Greater Cost of Debt?,"Holding companies legally separate the assets and owners of a company creating a layer of liability protection. Theoretically, this feature lowers the risk attributable to holding companies, enabling them to offer lower-cost debts compared to stand-alone alternatives. However, no study has ever tested this hypothesis due to its technical and practical difficulties. Testing this hypothesis requires a separate classification of holding and stand-alone companies' outstanding debts to compare their risk spreads, controlling the bonds' risk ranking, maturities, and issue sizes. Further, a model is needed to make the callable bond spreads with unknown maturity dates comparable to non-callable bonds. This work is the first attempt to evaluate the risk spreads of stand-alone banks and bank holding companies in Spain by including all outstanding rated bonds offered by Spanish banks. In order to make callable bond spreads comparable with noncallable bond spreads, we obtained the option-adjusted spreads for the bonds using a lattice option-pricing model that treats the callable bonds as a bond with embedded options. We then regressed to option-adjusted spreads on control variables and ownership structure dummy to see if there exists a statistically and economically significant coefficient for the introduced dummy variable. We found that bank-holding company bonds have higher risk spreads compared to the stand-alone alternatives in Spain. This may be attributable to the characteristics of holding companies that introduce other risks that offset the gains obtained from the added layer of liability protection.",2023
Trends in Triptan Usage in Korea: A Population-Based Cohort Study,"Background: Migraine presents a significant global health problem that emphasizes the need for efficient acute treatment options. Triptans, introduced in the early 1990s, have substantially advanced migraine management owing to their effectiveness compared to that of traditional medications. However, data on triptan use in migraine management from Asian countries, where migraines tend to have milder symptoms than those in European and North American countries, are limited. This study aimed to identify the trends in triptan usage in Korea. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort spanning from 2002 to 2019. Patients with migraine were identified using the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision codes, and triptan prescriptions were evaluated annually in terms of quantity, pills per patient, and associated costs. The distribution of triptan prescriptions across different medical specialties was also examined. Factors contributing to the odds of triptan use were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: From 2002 to 2019, the total number of triptan tablets, prescriptions, and patients using triptans increased by 24.0, 17.1, and 13.6 times, respectively, with sumatriptan being the most frequently prescribed type of triptan. Additionally, the number of prescriptions and related costs have consistently increased despite stable pricing because of government regulation. By 2019, only approximately one-tenth of all patients with migraines had been prescribed triptans, although there was a notable increase in prescriptions over the study period. These prescription patterns varied according to the physician's specialty. After adjusting for patient-specific factors including age and sex, the odds of prescribing triptans were higher for neurologists than for internal medicine physicians (odds ratio 2.875, P < 0.001), while they were lower for general practitioners (odds ratio 0.220, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings revealed an increasing trend in triptan use among individuals with migraines in Korea, aligning with global usage patterns. Despite these increases, the overall prescription rate of triptans remains low, indicating potential underutilization and highlighting the need for improved migraine management strategies across all medical fields. Further efforts are necessary to optimize the use of triptans in treating migraines effectively.",2024
From Indication-Based Pricing to Blended Approach: Evidence on the Price and Reimbursement Negotiation in Italy,"BackgroundNew indications for existing medicines are increasing over time. In most countries, drug pricing and reimbursement conditions are renegotiated every time a new indication is approved. There is a growing interest in the price negotiation model for new indications, specifically comparing an indication-based versus blended approach. However, little evidence currently exists regarding the complexity of these negotiations and their impact on actual prices. Italy has recently transitioned from an indication-based approach to a blended price model. This study aims to measure the impact of price and reimbursement negotiation of new indications on discounts (i.e. actual prices) and on the negotiation duration, used as a proxy of its complexity.MethodsWe considered new indications approved through a European centralized procedure from January 2013 to March 2022 for which the price and reimbursement status was approved in Italy between January 2015 and March 2022, amounting to 52 new indications. Data on the timeframe of the Italian price and reimbursement process and its phases were obtained from publicly available sources. Discounts for the first indication and their subsequent increases for new indications were estimated by comparing ex-factory prices and tendered prices. To calculate p-values, we employed the Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression models were utilized to examine correlations between negotiation time and the characteristics of the medicines.ResultsThe mean time to reimbursement was 603 days, in contrast to 583 days for the first launch. Price negotiation took longer for rare diseases, cancer drugs, and in case of therapies with minor added therapeutic value. On average, the additional discount (on top of discounts for prior indications) was 13%, significantly lower than the mean discount for the first indications approved (24.9%). The discounts increment was lower, but negotiation took longer if a Managed Entry Agreement accompanied the final agreement. Additionally, discounts have increased over the years.ConclusionThe negotiation for new indications takes longer than the first one, and provides, on average, an additional discount of 13%. While our findings bear the potential for significant policy implications, they necessitate prudent interpretation due to a limited number of observations. The increasing trend in additional discounts over time applied to all indications in recent negotiations, may suggest a descending trend of value for new indications and a shift from an indication-based pricing approach to a blended model. Otherwise, budget impact considerations might have outweighed a value-based approach in the recent negotiations. If so, two potential options for restoring a value-based approach are returning to an indication-based pricing or giving explicit and higher weight to value within a blended model.",2024
SMALL SCALE ENERGY STORAGE FOR PEAK DEMAND SHAVING,"Utilities in regulated energy markets manage power generation, transmission, and delivery to consumers. Matching peak demand with peak generation is costly, and the increasing penetration of renewable energy into the grid adds complexity due to fluctuations in supply. A few options exist for addressing the task of balancing supply and demand, including demand response, energy storage, and time-varying pricing (tariffs). Arizona Public Service (APS), the largest electric utility company in Arizona, employs tariffs that charge more for electricity at certain times (on-peak periods) and a demand charge for the highest power demand throughout the billing period. Such tariffs incentivize end users to lower peak demand. Arizona State University (ASU), a public university with its largest campus in Tempe, AZ, participates in a time-of-use tariff structure with APS. Analysis in this paper shows that ASU's 16MWdc of onsite solar capacity alone can lower its monthly electricity bills by over 10% by decreasing on-peak power demand. A novel contribution of the paper is the analysis of the value of small scale, on-campus energy storage in lowering the demand charge. Most analyses consider savings from transferring offpeak electric power to peak-electric power, but this paper considers using stored electricity solely to reduce peak demand and thus lower the demand charge. Small amounts of electricity could greatly reduce overall cost. An algorithm was developed and executed in Python to decide when on-campus storage should be charged and discharged. The critical part of the algorithm is to decide when to discharge. Deploying too early, or too late, will not change peak demand. The paper's storage dispatch model is implemented alongside a financial model that calculates the savings in electricity bills and determines the net present value (NPV) of different storage technologies as a function of storage lifetime and installed capacity (kWh). The results show that, for all storage technologies considered, a positive NPV is realized. NPVs are very sensitive to actual power demand and thus vary from year to year. This is to be expected because the storage dispatch strategy operates on extreme values, which tend to include very rare events. This analysis uses actual data from ASU, which allows us to extend the results to other universities and commercial customers. The favorable results suggest that a smarter dispatch algorithm based on machine learning would enable further cost savings by determining what can be thought of as a shadow price of electricity.",2017
Effects of geographical origin and post-harvesting processing on the bioactive compounds and sensory quality of Brazilian specialty coffee beans,"Specialty coffee beans are those produced, processed, and characterized following the highest quality standards, toward delivering a superior final product. Environmental, climatic, genetic, and processing factors greatly influence the green beans' chemical profile, which reflects on the quality and pricing. The present study focuses on the assessment of eight major health-beneficial bioactive compounds in green coffee beans aiming to underscore the influence of the geographical origin and post-harvesting processing on the quality of the final beverage. For that, we examined the non-volatile chemical profile of specialty Coffea arabica beans from Minas Gerais state, Brazil. It included samples from Cerrado (Savannah), and Matas de Minas and Sul de Minas (Atlantic Forest) regions, produced by two post-harvesting processing practices. Trigonelline, theobromine, theophylline, chlorogenic acid derivatives, caffeine, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid were quantified in the green beans by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Additionally, all samples were roasted and subjected to sensory analysis for coffee grading. Principal component analysis suggested that Cerrado samples tended to set apart from the other geographical locations. Those samples also exhibited higher levels of trigonelline as confirmed by two-way ANOVA analysis. Samples subjected to de-pulping processing showed improved chemical composition and sensory score. Those pulped coffees displayed 5.8% more chlorogenic acid derivatives, with an enhancement of 1.5% in the sensory score compared to unprocessed counterparts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis pointed out altitude, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, sweetness, and acidity as predictors distinguishing specialty coffee beans obtained by the two post-harvest processing. These findings demonstrate the influence of regional growth conditions and post-harvest treatments on the chemical and sensory quality of coffee. In summary, the present study underscores the value of integrating target metabolite analysis with statistical tools to augment the characterization of specialty coffee beans, offering novel insights for quality assessment with a focus on their bioactive compounds.",2024
Individual-level determinants of waterpipe smoking demand in four Eastern-Mediterranean countries,"The prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is at alarmingly high levels, especially among young people. The objective of this research was to evaluate the preferences of young adult waterpipe smokers with respect to potential individual-level determinants of waterpipe smoking using discrete choice experiment methodology. Participants were young adult university students (18-29 years) who were ever waterpipe smokers, recruited from universities across four Eastern Mediterranean countries: Jordan, Oman, Palestine and the United Arab Emirates. The Internet-based discrete choice experiment, with 6 x 3 x 2 block design, evaluated preferences for choices of waterpipe smoking sessions, presented on hypothetical waterpipe cafe menus. Participants evaluated nine choice sets, each with five fruit-flavored options, a tobacco flavored option (non-flavored), and an opt-out option. Choices also varied based on nicotine content (0.0% vs. 0.05% vs. 0.5%) and price (low vs. high). Participants were randomized to receive menus with either a pictorial thorn text health-warning message or no message (between-subjects attribute). Multinomial logit regression models evaluated the influence of these attributes on waterpipe smoking choices. Across all four samples (n = 1859), participants preferred fruit-flavored varieties to tobacco flavor, lower nicotine content and lower prices. Exposure to the health warning did not significantly predict likelihood to opt-out. Flavor accounted for 81.4% of waterpipe smoking decisions. Limiting the use of fruit flavors in waterpipe tobacco, in addition to accurate nicotine content labeling and higher pricing may be effective at curbing the demand for waterpipe smoking among young adults.",2019
Competitive pricing within pharmaceutical classes: evidence on follow-on drugs in Germany 1993-2008,"Competition from follow-on drugs has been a highly controversial issue. Manufacturers launching new molecules in existing drug classes have often been criticized for inflating health systems' expenses, but it has been argued that such drugs increase therapeutic options. Economic theory suggests that follow-on drugs induce price competition. We contribute to this discussion by addressing the topic of pricing at market entry and price development in the German market. We measure determinants of price strategies of follow-on drugs using regression analyses, considering all new molecules launched in the German market from 1993 to 2008. Prices of products are standardized on defined daily dosages controlling for sales volumes based on data from the IMS Health DPM database and for the therapeutic quality of a new product using ratings by Fricke/Klaus as a proxy for innovation. We identify prices correlating with therapeutic value at market entry. While the first two molecules engage in quality competition, price discounts below the market price can be observed from the third entrant on. Price discounts are even more distinct in development races with several drugs entering the market within 2 years and in classes with a low degree of therapeutic differentiation. Prices remain relatively constant over time. This study contributes to assessments of competition in pharmaceutical markets focusing on price strategies of new market entrants. After an initial phase of market building, further follow-on products induce price competition. Largely unchanged prices after 4 years may be interpreted as quality competition and can be attributed to prices in Germany being anchor points for international price referencing.",2015
Patient socioeconomic determinants for the choice of the cheapest molecule within a cluster: evidence from Belgian prescription data,"Reference pricing is a common cost-sharing mechanism, with the financial penalty for the use of costly drugs shifted from the third-party payer to the patient. Unintended distributional consequences might arise, if the weakest socioeconomic groups face a relatively higher financial burden. This study analyzed for a sample of Belgian individual prescription data for 4 clusters of commonly used drugs (proton pump inhibitors, statins and two groups of antihypertensives [drugs acting on renin-angiotensin system and dihydropyridine derivatives]) whether the probability to receive the least expensive molecule within a cluster was linked to the socioeconomic status of the patient. Logistic regression models included individual demographic, working, chronic illness and financial status and small area education data for 906,543 prescriptions from 1,280 prescribing general practitioners and specialists. For the 4 clusters, results show that patients with lower socioeconomic status consistently use slightly more the least expensive drugs than other patients. Larger effects are observed for patients residing in a nursing home for the elderly, patients entitled to increased reimbursement of co-payments, unemployed, patients treated in a primary care center financed per capita (and not fee-for-service) and patients having a chronic illness. Also, patients residing in neighborhoods with low education status use more less expensive drugs. The findings of the study suggest that although equity considerations were not explicitly taken into account in the design of the reference price system, there is no real equity problem, as the costly drugs with supplement are not prescribed more often in patients from lower socioeconomic classes.",2012
"Assessment of the influence of food attributes on meal choice selection by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity among women living in Chicago, USA: A discrete choice experiment","Large and persistent obesity disparities exist in the US by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity, and weight loss interventions have traditionally been less effective in these populations. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the behavioral, economic, and geographic factors that influence obesity risk factors such as eating behaviors. We used a discrete choice experiment to evaluate the impact of different meal attributes on meal choice and to test whether the relative importance of these attributes varied by SES and race/ethnicity. Study participants (n = 228) were given a series of 10 choice tasks and asked to choose among 4 meals, each rated based on the following attributes: taste; healthfulness; preparation time; travel time to food outlet for meal/ingredients; and price. SES was measured using education and self-reported difficulty paying for basics. Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic/Latina, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic other. Data were analyzed using mixed logit regression models with interaction terms to determine whether meal attributes influenced meal choices differentially by SES and race/ethnicity. Healthfulness and taste were the most important attributes for all participants. Price was a more important attribute among those in the lowest SES group compared with those in the higher SES groups. Travel was the least important attribute for low SES participants, and it was not significantly related to meal choice in these groups. Discrete choice experiments as illustrated here may help pinpoint the most salient targets for interventions to improve eating behaviors and reduce obesity disparities. Specifically, our findings suggest interventions should incorporate strategies to target the pricing of healthy and unhealthy food options.",2019
The mystery of choice of equity incentive model: based on the game theory analysis between shareholders and top executives,"PurposeBased on the background of the restricted stock has gradually replaced stock option and has become the mainstream equity incentive model in China, this paper aims to investigate the which factors affect the choice of equity incentive model, and the impacts of equity incentive model. Design/methodology/approachThe theoretical analysis is based on the game theory between shareholders and top executives. The empirical analysis is based on the detailed data of equity incentives in China's listed companies from 2006 to 2017; the logit method and least square method are implemented to estimate the regression coefficients and Black-Scholes options pricing model to estimate the value of restricted stock/option granted to the CEO. FindingsThis paper documents that enterprises with serious agency problems, high investment risks, high stock price synchronicity and great executive power are significantly and positively related to restricted stock. The main empirical findings still hold after several robust tests. In addition, restricted stock can significantly improve corporate performance when the performance evaluation index is strict and the validity period is long, while for the sample group with loose performance index and short validity period, restricted stock significantly reduces corporate performance. Originality/valueThis paper analyzes the black box of equity incentive model selection from the stakeholders' game perspective by constructing a game theory model to investigate the reasons for the choice of equity incentive model in various situations, which enriches the research in this field. Moreover, this paper finds that restricted stock has both incentive and welfare characteristics, and the rationality of performance appraisal goals is the key factor leading to the difference in incentive effects. Overall, the research indicates that only well-designed equity incentive plans can improve corporate performance, which contributes to regulators and practitioners to form a rational understanding of restricted stock model and provides a reference for their decision-making.",2023
Ethnozoological and commercial drivers of the pangolin trade in Benin,"BackgroundPangolins are trafficked in unsustainable volumes to feed both local and global trade networks for their meat and the medicinal properties of their derivatives, including scales. We focus on a West African country (Benin) to assess the medicinal and spiritual values of pangolins among different ethnic groups and identify the cohort of buyers involved in the pangolin trade and related economic values along the chain, notably from local diasporas.MethodsWe organised 54 focus groups in villages surrounding occurrence habitats of pangolins across Benin and conducted 35 individual interviews with vendors from five major traditional medicine markets (TMMs). Our questionnaire addressed the different uses of pangolins, the commercial value of pangolin items, the categories of clients and the related selling prices.ResultsPangolin meat was strictly consumed as food. Scales, head, bones, tongue, blood, heart and xiphisternum were the items used by local communities as part of medicinal (65% of the focus groups) and spiritual (37%) practices. Scales were the most frequently used item (use value index = 1.56). A total of 42 medicinal and spiritual uses, covering 15 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories, were recorded among ethnic groups. The ICD and spiritual categories-based analyses of similarity showed a partial overlapping of ethnozoological knowledge across Benin, although knowledge was significantly influenced by ethnicity and geographic location. The pricing of pangolins both varied with the category of stakeholders (local communities vs. stakeholders of TMMs) and clients (local and West African clients vs. Chinese community) and the type of items sold. The Chinese community was reported to only buy pangolins alive, and average selling prices were 3-8 times higher than those to West African clients.ConclusionsOur results confirm that pangolins in Africa are valuable and versatile resources for consumption and medicinal / spiritual practices. The pangolin trade in Benin is based on an endogenous and complex network of actors that now appears influenced by the specific, high-valued demand from the Chinese diaspora. Further investigations are required to assess the growing impact of the Chinese demand on the African wildlife trade.",2021
Maturity grading of jujube for industrial applications harnessing deep learning,"PurposeTo develop and examine an efficient and reliable jujube grading model with reduced computational time, which could be utilized in the food processing and packaging industries to perform quick grading and pricing of jujube as well as for the other similar types of fruits.Design/methodology/approachThe whole process begins with manual analysis and collection of four jujube grades from the jujube tree, in addition to this jujube image acquisition was performed utilizing MVS which is further followed by image pre-processing and augmentation tasks. Eventually, classification models (i.e. proposed model, from scratch and pre-trained VGG16 and AlexNet) were trained and validated over the original and augmented datasets to discriminate the jujube into maturity grades.FindingsThe highest success rates reported over the original and augmented datasets were 97.53% (i.e. error of 2.47%) and 99.44% (i.e. error of 0.56%) respectively using Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.003.Research limitations/implicationsThe investigation relies upon a single view of the jujube image and the outer appearance of the jujube. In the future, multi-view image capturing system could be employed for the model training/validation.Practical implicationsDue to the vast functional derivatives of jujube, the identification of maturity grades of jujube is paramount in the fruit industry, functional food production industries and pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the proposed model which is practically feasible and easy to implement could be utilized in such industries.Originality/valueThis research examines the performance of proposed CNN models for selected optimizer and learning rates for the grading of jujube maturity into four classes and compares them with the classical models to depict the sublime model in terms of accuracy, the number of parameters, epochs and computational time. After a thorough investigation of the models, it was discovered that the proposed model transcends both classical models in all aspects for both the original and augmented datasets utilizing Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.003.",2024
THE WELFARE CONSEQUENCES OF TAXING CARBON,"For EMF 32, we applied a new version of our Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (IGEM) based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). We simulated the impacts arising from the Energy Modeling Forum's broad range of carbon taxes under three revenue recycling options - lump sum redistributions, capital tax reductions, and labor tax cuts. We examined their consequences for industry prices and quantities, for the overall economy, and for the welfare of households, individuals, and society, the latter in terms of efficiency and equity. We rank recycling mechanisms from most to least favorable in terms of the magnitudes of their impacts on net social welfare - efficiency net of equity - recognizing that other objectives may be more important to policy makers and the public. Finally, we and the EMF 32 effort focus only on the economic effects of carbon taxation and revenue recycling; the environmental benefits arising from emissions reductions are not within our scope of study. We find CO2 emissions abatement to be invariant to the chosen recycling scheme. This means that policy makers need not compromise their environmental objectives when designing carbon tax swap options. We also find additional emissions reductions beyond the scope of coverage and points of taxation. Reducing capital taxes promotes new saving, investment and capital formation and is the most favorable recycling mechanism. In 2010 dollars, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $0.19 to $3.90 depending on the path of carbon prices. Reducing labor taxes promotes consumption and work through real-wage incentives and is the next most favorable recycling scheme. Here, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $11.09 to $16.49 depending on the carbon tax trajectory. Lump sum redistribution of carbon tax revenues is the least favorable recycling option. It incentivizes neither capital nor labor. Consequently, the damages to the economy and welfare are the greatest among the three schemes. With lump sum recycling, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $37.15 to $43.61 as carbon taxation becomes more aggressive. While this ranking is common among the participating EMF 32 models, the spread in our results is the greatest in comparison which we attribute to the substitution possibilities inherent in IGEM's econometrics, the absence of barriers to factor mobility, and likely differences in the manner in which tax incentives are structured. We find welfare gains are possible under capital and labor tax recycling when emissions accounting is viewed from a top-down rather than a bottom-up perspective and carbon pricing is at an economy-wide average. However, these gains occur at the expense of abatement. We find capital tax recycling to be regressive while labor tax recycling is progressive as is redistribution through lump sums. Moreover, we find that the lump sum mechanism provides the best means for sheltering the poorest from the welfare consequences of carbon taxation. Thus, promoting capital formation is the best use of carbon tax revenues in terms of reducing the magnitudes of welfare losses while the lump sum and labor tax options are the best uses for reducing inequality.",2018
Does the managerial compensation scheme affect the investment and capital structure policy?,"Since Berle and Means (1932) stressed the effect of partial ownership on managerial decision makings, the finance literature has suggested various mechanisms of corporate governance to align managers' selfish incentives with firm value maximization. The managerial compensation scheme has been recognized as one of the most important mechanisms of corporate governance. The most controversial issue in designing a compensation scheme is the sensitivity of managers' wealth to stock price and stock volatility. This paper provides empirical evidence of a strong relation between the structure of managerial compensation and value-critical managerial decisions, such as investment policy and capital structure policy. Specifically, we find that higher prior delta (wealth-to-performance sensitivity) and vega (wealth-to-volatifity sensitivity) of managers' wealth are associated with increased investments in research and development, as well as in property, plant, and equipment. But higher prior delta and vega of managers' wealth are associated with lower leverage. This evidence provides a support for the hypothesis that a managerial compensation schemes with higher sensitivity to stock price and volatility increases executives' incentive to invest in riskier projects and, at the same time, to use lower debt levels as a bonding mechanism. Since company-wide option plans have become a substantial component of many firms' equity capital and managerial compensation, a growing body of research on stock options addresses the incentive implications of firm-level option plans (Core and Guay. 2002; Coles, Daniel and Naveen, 2004). In these studies, the key process in measuring the delta and vega of managers' wealth is related with pricing of executive stock options. We measure the delta of managers' wealth as the sensitivity of their stock and option value with respect to a 1% change in stock price, and the vega as the sensitivity of their option value with respect to a 0.01 change in stock return volatility. Using data from the Korean Listed Company Association (KLCA), we compiled all relevant values in estimating the delta and vega of executive stock options such as the total number of options outstanding at the end of the fiscal year, the exercise prices, and remaining times to maturity. We also used KLCA database for managerial share holdings and stock prices. The delta of managers' wealth is defined as the sum of option delta and stock delta. Assuming that the vega of stock is zero, we define the vega of managers' wealth as the option vega. The sample of this research consists of 97 non-financial firms that have endowed stock options as a means of executive compensation since year 2000. The investment policy of a firm is proxied by two variables: the proportion of research and development (R&D) expenditures to total sales, and the capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment (PPE) to total assets. The capital structure policy is proxied by a market value leverage ratio and a book value leverage ratio. We employ both pooled regressions and simultaneous regressions in analyzing the effect of delta and vega on the investment and capital structure decisions. Our empirical analyses show that the delta and vega of managerial wealth are positively related to R&D investments mid PPE investments of the firm, and are negatively related to the leverage ratio. The positive relation between the managers' wealth sensitivity and investment implies that managers' wealth sensitivity increases the fisk-taking incentive of managers. The negative relation between the managers' wealth sensitivity and leverage ratios implies that managers use the debt level as a bonding mechanism, not as a risk-increasing mechanism. Since the capital structure policy is more easily exposed to external monitoring than the investment policy, managers with higher delta or vega are more prone to choose the investment policy, compared to the capital structure, as a means of increasing risk level of the firm. We could hypothesize that mangers with higher delta and vega as the incentive to increase the risk level of a firm, would invest in riskier projects, and at the same time, maintain a lower debt level of bond themselves to outside investors. Our results are robust to model specifications. Year-by-year regression results are Qualitatively the same as those of pooled regression. We also set up a simultaneous equation system to incorporate a possible endogenous relation among wealth sensitivities, investment policy, and capital structure policy, and re-estimate the relation among variables. The simultaneous equation estimators are consistent with the results of pooled or year-by-year regressions. Our empirical findings as a whole support the hypothesis: higher sensitivity to stock price and volatility in the managerial compensation scheme gives executives more incentive to aggressively increase the investment level, and to use a lower debt level as a bonding mechanism. Thus, equity-based compensation such as executive stock options significantly affects value-critical managerial decisions including those of investment policy and capital structure policy.",2006
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in healthcare: a thematic analysis and research agenda,"Introduction In the big data era, where corporations commodify health data, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) present a transformative avenue for patient empowerment and control. NFTs are unique digital assets on the blockchain, representing ownership of digital objects, including health data. By minting their data as NFTs, patients can track access, monetize its use, and build secure, private health information systems. However, research on NFTs in healthcare is in its infancy, warranting a comprehensive review. Methods This study conducted a systematic literature review and thematic analysis of NFTs in healthcare to identify use cases, design models, and key challenges. Five multidisciplinary research databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, Elsevier Science Direct) were searched. The approach involved four stages: paper collection, inclusion/exclusion criteria application, screening, full-text reading, and quality assessment. A classification and coding framework was employed. Thematic analysis followed six steps: data familiarization, initial code generation, theme searching, theme review, theme definition/naming, and report production. Results Analysis of 19 selected papers revealed three primary use cases: patient-centric data management, supply chain management for data provenance, and digital twin development. Notably, most solutions were prototypes or frameworks without real-world implementations. Four overarching themes emerged: data governance (ownership, tracking, privacy), data monetization (commercialization, incentivization, sharing), data protection, and data storage. The focus lies on user-controlled, private, and secure health data solutions. Additionally, data commodification is explored, with mechanisms proposed to incentivize data maintenance and sharing. NFTs are also suggested for tracking medical products in supply chains, ensuring data integrity and provenance. Ethereum and similar platforms dominate NFT minting, while compact NFT storage options are being explored for faster data access. Conclusion NFTs offer significant potential for secure, traceable, decentralized healthcare data exchange systems. However, challenges exist, including dependence on blockchain, interoperability issues, and associated costs. The review identified research gaps, such as developing dual ownership models and data pricing strategies. Building an open standard for interoperability and adoption is crucial. The scalability, security, and privacy of NFT-backed healthcare applications require further investigation. Thus, this study proposes a research agenda for adopting NFTs in healthcare, focusing on governance, storage models, and perceptions.",2024
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Versus Warfarin in Thai Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation,"Background Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been recommended as preferred options for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) versus warfarin by guidelines worldwide. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each NOAC in a Thai health care environment, a country with upper middle-income economies based on the World Bank's classification. Method A lifetime Markov model was created from a Thai societal perspective. The model consisted of 19 health states separated into two cycles: event cycle and consequence cycle. The consequences of AF included in the model were ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, extracranial haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction. All NOACs available in Thailand (dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 ing once daily; apixaban 5 mg twice daily; edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg once daily) were assessed using warfarin with an international normalised ratio of 2-3 as the reference. Inputs were a combination of published literature and local data when available. A willingness-to-pay of 160,000 Thai baht (THB)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold of being cost-effective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. Results All NOACs were not cost-effective strategies for the Thai AF population. The ranking of incremental cost- effectiveness ratios from lowest to highest were apixaban 5 mg twice daily (THB 692,136 or US$21,862) followed by edoxaban 60 mg once daily (THB 911,772 or US$28,799), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (THB 913,749 or US$28,861), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (THB 1,102,106 or US$34,811), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (THB 1,195,347 or US$37,756), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (THB 1,347,650 or US$42,566). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that apixaban had the highest potential to be a cost-effective strategy versus other NOACs. Conclusions Our findings indicated that all NOACs were not cost-effective in the Thai AF population. Of the NOACs, apixaban may be the most likely to be cost-effective. These data may be useful for policymakers to perform a comprehensive evaluation of these agents for formulary decision and pricing negotiation.",2020
