A Fast Discovery Model for Production Financial Risk Using Large Language Model and Knowledge Graph,"This paper focuses on building an innovative industrial financial risk rapid discovery model based on large language model and knowledge graph inference. Firstly, this work deeply analyzes the diversity, concealment and rapid propagation of industrial financial risks. Secondly, it points out the limitations of traditional risk assessment methods when dealing with massive and heterogeneous financial data. Then, it designs an integrated strategy to integrate the powerful natural language processing and understanding ability of large language models. Combined with the advantages of knowledge graph in structured information representation, this model analyzes financial text data through a large language model. Hence, key information can be automatically extracted and a preliminary risk knowledge base can be built. Finally, an industrial financial network can be established to realize correlation mining and dynamic evolution analysis of risk factors. The experimental results show that the model can effectively capture risk signals in the industrial chain, and detect potential financial risks in advance. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of industrial financial risk management, but also provides strong technical support for risk prevention and control in practice.",2025
AT-FinGPT: Financial risk prediction via an audio-text large language model,"Financial risk prediction is crucial for investment decision-making. Traditional machine learning methods are limited by their structures and parameter size, which hinders their generalizability and effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs), which are pretrained with very large dataset and many GPUs have recently shown promising improvements in financial risk prediction. Despite this progress, most existing financial LLMs mainly rely on textual data for training and prediction, overlooking audio data and limiting analysis to text summarization. However, natural language processing studies have shown that audio from CEOs' quarterly earnings calls is crucial for financial risk prediction. In this work, we introduce an audio-text LLM named ATFinGPT, which fuses financial audio data and summarization texts for financial risk prediction. The empirical experimental results show that AT-FinGPT is superior to most advanced methods. Through an ablation study, we demonstrate that different data sources can facilitate financial risk assessment and discuss the effectiveness of each part in the AT-FinGPT model.",2025
Can ChatGPT predict Chinese equity premiums?,"Leveraging over 1.86 million news headlines, we examine the capability of ChatGPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM), to predict equity risk premiums in the Chinese market. The predictive scores from ChatGPT not only positively and significantly forecast equity premiums but also markedly outperform the bag-of-words (BoW) method, demonstrating its superior capability to discern intricate market sentiments from extensive datasets. The consistent and reliable performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample tests underscores the effectiveness of ChatGPT and its potential to revolutionize financial forecasting. This study highlights the substantial value and innovative contribution of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, in enriching the precision and depth of financial market analysis.",2024
Can AI beat a naive portfolio? An experiment with anonymized data,"Using anonymized data from the United States (U.S.) market, we evaluate the performance of Google's main LLM (Large Language Model) Gemini 1.5 Flash in making investment decisions. Unlike other studies, we query the LLM for different investment horizons (1 to 36 months) and types of financial information (financial data, price data, and a combination of both). Running a total of 30,000 simulations for 1,522 companies over 20 years of data, we find that Gemini does not consistently outperform a naive portfolio and the S&P 500 index in terms of returns and Sharpe ratios. Additionally, our findings indicate a decline in risk adjusted investment performance as the investment horizon extends.",2025
Combatting Senior Scams Using a Large Language Model-Created Rubric,"This paper addresses the critical issue of internet scams targeting seniors by developing a robust, Machine Learning (ML) based solution employing a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, to enhance scam detection and prevention. Elderly internet users are particularly vulnerable to digital fraud due to a lack of familiarity with technological safeguards and a tendency not to report incidents. Traditional security measures often fail to accommodate the unique challenges faced by this demographic, prompting our focus on a specialized, user-friendly solution. We propose an innovative approach using ChatGPT 3.5 to analyze and score emails based on their likelihood of being scams, thus providing seniors with a tool that requires minimal interaction while offering maximum protection. This system uses a custom rubric developed through ML techniques to evaluate potential threats effectively. By integrating word embeddings and a diverse training dataset, the model adapts to the nuanced and evolving nature of scam tactics. The methodology utilized in this paper ensures that the ML model not only identifies common scam indicators but also provides actionable feedback to users, making it a practical tool for real-world applications. Preliminary results demonstrate the system's efficacy in recognizing scam emails, thereby significantly reducing the risk of financial loss among seniors and enhancing their confidence in digital communication. This paper outlines the design, implementation, and testing phases of the project, highlighting the potential of LLMs in cybersecurity, specifically in protecting a vulnerable population.",2024
ChatGPT-Assisted Classification fi cation of Postoperative Bleeding Following Microinvasive Glaucoma Surgery Using Electronic Health Record Data,"Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a large language model (LLM) in classifying electronic health record (EHR) text, and to use this classification to evaluate the type and resolution of hemorrhagic events (HEs) after microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: Eyes from the Bascom Palmer Glaucoma Repository. Methods: Eyes that underwent MIGS between July 1, 2014 and February 1, 2022 were analyzed. Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) was used to classify deidentified EHR anterior chamber examination text into HE categories (no hyphema, microhyphema, clot, and hyphema). Agreement between classifications by ChatGPT and a glaucoma specialist was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa and precision-recall (PR) curve. Time to resolution of HEs was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Goniotomy HE resolution was evaluated by degree of angle treatment (90 degrees-179 degrees,180 degrees-269 degrees, 270 degrees-360 degrees). degrees-360 degrees ). Logistic regression was used to identify HE risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Accuracy of ChatGPT HE classification and incidence and resolution of HEs. Results: The study included 434 goniotomy eyes (368 patients) and 528 Schlemm's canal stent (SCS) eyes (390 patients). Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer facilitated excellent HE classification (Cohen's kappa 0.93, area under PR curve 0.968). Using ChatGPT classifications, at postoperative day 1, HEs occurred in 67.8% of goniotomy and 25.2% of SCS eyes (P < 0.001). The 270 degrees degrees to 360 degrees degrees goniotomy group had the highest HE rate (84.0%, P < 0.001). At postoperative week 1, HEs were observed in 43.4% and 11.3% of goniotomy and SCS eyes, respectively (P < 0.001). By postoperative month 1, HE rates were 13.3% and 1.3% among goniotomy and SCS eyes, respectively (P < 0.001). Time to HE resolution differed between the goniotomy angle groups (log-rank P = 0.034); median time to resolution was 10, 10, and 15 days for the 90 degrees degrees to 179 degrees, 180 degrees to 269 degrees, and 270 degrees to 360 degrees groups, respectively. Risk factor analysis demonstrated greater goniotomy angle was the only significant predictor of HEs (odds ratio for 270 degrees-360 degrees: 360 degrees : 4.08, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Large language models can be effectively used to classify longitudinal EHR free-text examination data with high accuracy, highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-assisted research and clinical decision support. Hemorrhagic events are relatively common self-resolving complications that occur more often in goniotomy cases and with larger goniotomy treatments. Time to HE resolution differs significantly between goniotomy groups.

Assessing ChatGPT's Proficiency in Quantitative Risk Management,"The purpose and novelty of this article is to investigate the extent to which artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT can grasp concepts from quantitative risk management. To this end, we enter a scholarly discussion with ChatGPT in the form of questions and answers, and analyze the responses. The questions are classics from undergraduate and graduate courses on quantitative risk management, and address risk in general, risk measures, time series, extremes and dependence. As a result, the non-technical aspects of risk (such as explanations of various types of financial risk, the driving factors underlying the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, or a basic introduction to the Basel Framework) are well understood by ChatGPT. More technical aspects (such as mathematical facts), however, are often inaccurate or wrong, partly in rather subtle ways not obvious without expert knowledge, which we point out. The article concludes by providing guidance on the types of applications for which consulting ChatGPT can be useful in order to enhance one's own knowledge of quantitative risk management (e.g., using ChatGPT as an educational tool to test one's own understanding of an already grasped concept, or using ChatGPT as a practical tool for identifying risks just not on one's own radar), and points out those applications for which the current version of ChatGPT should not be invoked (e.g., for learning mathematical concepts, or for learning entirely new concepts for which one has no basis of comparison to assess ChatGPT's capabilities).",2023
LLM-infused bi-level semantic enhancement for corporate credit risk prediction,"Corporate credit risk (CCR) prediction enables investors, governments, and companies to make informed financial decisions. Existing research primarily focuses solely on the tabular feature values, yet it often overlooks the rich inherent semantic information. In this paper, a novel bi-level semantic enhancement framework for CCR prediction is proposed. Firstly, at the data- level, a large language model (LLM) generates detailed textual descriptions of companies' financial conditions, infusing raw tabular training data with semantic information and domain knowledge. Secondly, to enable semantic perception during inference when only tabular data is available, a contrastive multimodal multitask learning model (CMML) is proposed at the model level. CMML leverages the semantically enhanced data from the previous level to acquire semantic perception capabilities during the training phase, requiring only tabular data during prediction. It aligns the representations of tabular data with textual data, enabling extracting semantically rich features from tabular data. Furthermore, a semantic alignment classifier and an MLP classifier are integrated into a weighted ensemble learner within a multitask learning architecture to enhance robustness. Empirical verification on two datasets demonstrates that CMML surpasses benchmark models in key metrics, particularly in scenarios with limited samples and high proportions of unseen corporations, implying its effectiveness in CCR prediction through bi-level semantic enhancement.",2025
Impact of EU non-financial reporting regulation on Spanish companies' environmental disclosure: a cutting-edge natural language processing approach,"BackgroundA debate exists about the effects of environmental disclosure becoming mandatory on the quality and the actual commitment of such reporting. This study seeks to assess whether differences exist when comparing the disclosure quality and comprehensiveness of Spanish companies' non-financial reports under voluntary and mandatory reporting regimes spanning the period 2015-2022.MethodsWe present a novel approach by utilizing cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, chiefly ClimateBERT (a transformer-LLM-Large Language Model) and ClimateBERT fine-tuned on ClimaText (a public database for climate change topic detection), to scrutinize and compare 729 voluntary and mandatory non-financial corporate reports from 96 Spanish companies spanning multiple sectors. Since transformers can only be accurately estimated by organizations with lots of computing power, but not by small organizations, we have also fine-tuned the transformer, something cheaper in computational terms, thus making it affordable to all companies, investors, regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders.ResultsOur results document interesting patterns and strong trends of enhancement in specificity and commitment, particularly in risk-related texts, spanning the period 2015-2022. We provide descriptive evidence and an explorative appeal that underscores the regulations' influence, among many other factors also identified by prior literature (other stakeholders' requirements and expectations from companies, aside from the regulatory stakeholders), in fostering a higher quality and more comprehensive approach to climate risk reporting by Spanish companies, with enhanced alignment to internationally recognized reporting guidelines. In addition, the comparative analysis between the transformer model and the fine-tuned transformer model revealed subtle yet insightful differences in how climate disclosures are interpreted. The fine-tuned model exhibited an increased sensitivity to elements of commitment, specificity, and neutrality in climate texts.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential of cutting-edge NLP techniques, like fine-tuned transformers, in the quantitative assessment of the evolution and quality of environmental disclosures, either mandatory or voluntary. It is the first paper applying a fine-tuned transformer-LLM to compare the currently in force European mandatory environmental disclosure regulation's impact on Spanish companies' environmental disclosure versus previous voluntary reporting.",2025
"LLM-Driven, Self-Improving Framework for Security Test Automation: Leveraging Karate DSL for Augmented API Resilience","Modern software architectures heavily rely on APIs, yet face significant security challenges, particularly with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities, which remain the most critical API security risk according to OWASP. This paper introduces Karate-BOLA-Guard, an innovative framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to automate security-focused test case generation for APIs. Our approach integrates vector databases for context retrieval, multiple LLM models for test generation, and observability tools for process monitoring. Initial experiments were carried out on three deliberately vulnerable APIs (VAmPI, Crapi, and OWASP Juice Shop), with subsequent validation on fifteen additional production APIs spanning diverse domains including social media, version control systems, financial services, and transportation services. Our evaluation metrics show Llama 3 8B achieving consistent performance (Accuracy: 3.1-3.4, Interoperability: 3.7-4.3) with an average processing time of 143.76 seconds on GPU. Performance analysis revealed significant GPU acceleration benefits, with 20-25x improvement over CPU processing times. Smaller models demonstrated efficient processing, with Phi-3 Mini averaging 69.58 seconds and Mistral 72.14 seconds, while maintaining acceptable accuracy scores. Token utilization patterns showed Llama 3 8B using an average of 36,591 tokens per session, compared to Mistral's 25,225 and Phi-3 Mini's 31,007. Our framework's effectiveness varied across APIs, with notably strong performance in complex platforms (Instagram: A = 4.3, I = 4.4) while maintaining consistent functionality in simpler implementations (VAmPI: A = 3.6, I = 4.3). The iterative refinement process, evaluated through comprehensive metrics including Accuracy (A), Complexity (C), and Interoperability (I), represents a significant advancement in automated API security testing, offering an efficient, accurate, and adaptable approach to detecting BOLA vulnerabilities across diverse API architectures.",2025
Application of Open AI in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Risk Assessment and Financial Analysis System,"In recent years, with the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also been growing rapidly. From widely known applications like Apple's Siri to the recent highly popular ChatGPT, people are leveraging AI for entertainment, learning, creative endeavors, and more.

MetaRisk: Semi-supervised few-shot operational risk classification in banking industry,"We study the operational risk classification problem, a critical yet challenging problem in the banking industry. In practice, banks build supervised multi-label classification models to identify the pre-defined risks using financial news sources. However, the models are often suboptimal due to the lack of labeled data and diverse combinations of risk types. To address these practical issues, we re-frame multi-label supervised operational risk classification as a semi-supervised few-shot learning problem, named MetaRisk, which can then be effectively learned using the prototypical network. We also propose a weighted scheme to help obtain accurately prototype vectors of multi-risk classes. We evaluate the proposed approach MetaRisk using a real-world operational risk classification dataset, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms a set of standard baselines. Especially, MetaRisk is capable of predicting risk types that are new to the system. We expect our work provides a direct and relevant toolkit that may assist risk officers to predict and intervene risks in the banking industry. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2021

This article reviews recent developments of generative AI in business and finance, summarizes its practical applications, provides examples of the latest generative AI tools, and demonstrates that generative AI can revolutionize data analysis in industry and academia. To test the ability of generative AI to support decision-making in financial markets, we use the ChatGPT to capture corporate sentiments towards environmental policy by inputting text extracted from corporate financial statements. Our results demonstrate that the sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT can predict firms' risk-management capabilities and stock return performance. This study also highlights the potential challenges and limitations associated with generative AI. Finally, we propose several questions for future research at the intersection of generative AI with business and finance.",2023
Does ChatGPT provide better advice than robo-advisors?,"We develop three investor profiles with different risk attitudes and consult ChatGPT and 17 roboadvisors to recommend an investment portfolio. We compare the recommendations with a benchmark derived from academic literature. ChatGPT's recommendations align with the three investor profiles and the benchmark. In contrast, only three out of the 17 robo-advisors come close to meeting the benchmark for all three investor profiles. Three robo-advisors fail to meet the benchmark for all investor profiles. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT provides better financial advice for one-time investments than robo-advisors. A policy implication is to clearly disclose that independent sophisticated chatbots can be recommended as a trustworthy source of information for retail investors.",2024
ChatGPT-Related Risk Patterns and Students' Creative Thinking Toward Tourism Statistics Course: Pretest and Posttest Quasi-Experimentation,"The existing research highlights the pivotal role of ChatGPT usage-related risk patterns in higher education students' creative thinking. Data was obtained from 1443 students at seven tourism colleges in Egypt. Statistical analysis tools (i.e., SPSS v.26 and ADANCO v.2.4) were employed for path testing. PLS-SEM findings proved that students' privacy, performance, financial, and psychological risks towards ChatGPT usage significantly decreased their creative thinking towards tourism statistics courses. Besides, students' inherent creative abilities positively affected creative thinking. Further, SPSS-based quasi-experimental findings confirmed that students who use ChatGPT apps have several risks that influence their creative thinking. Accordingly, the existing paper provides keen insights for tourism education policymakers.",2025
Addressing the notion of trust around ChatGPT in the high-stakes use case of insurance,"The public discourse concerning the level of (dis)trust in ChatGPT and other applications based on large language models (LLMs) is loaded with generic, dread risk terms, while the heterogeneity of relevant theoretical concepts and empirical measurements of trust further impedes in-depth analysis. Thus, a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving the trust judgment call is essential to avoid unwarranted trust. In this commentary paper, we propose that addressing the notion of trust in consumer-facing LLM-based systems across the insurance industry can confer enhanced specificity to this debate. The concept and role of trust are germane to this particular setting due to the highly intangible nature of the product coupled with elevated levels of risk, complexity, and information asymmetry. Moreover, widespread use of LLMs in this sector is to be expected, given the vast array of text documents, particularly general policy conditions or claims protocols. Insurance as a practice is highly relevant to the welfare of citizens and has numerous spillover effects on wider public policy areas. We therefore argue that a domain-specific approach to good AI governance is essential to avoid negative externalities around financial inclusion. Indeed, as a constitutive element of trust, vulnerability is particularly challenging within this highstakes set of transactions, with the adoption of LLMs adding to the socio-ethical risks. In light of this, our commentary provides a valuable baseline to support regulators and policymakers in unravelling the profound socioeconomic consequences that may arise from adopting consumer-facing LLMs in insurance.",2024
Measuring climate risk with ChatGPT: the influence of firms market value within supply chains in China,"This study examines the influence of climate risk on upstream and downstream firms within supply chains using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT). Climate risk not only affects corporate asset pricing but also propagates through interconnected supply chains, amplifying its impact on firms' financial performance and market value. The Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4th generation optimised mini (ChatGPT-4o-mini) model measures firms' climate risk levels, and the consistency and validity of this metric are verified against multiple external benchmarks. Empirical analysis based on two datasets reveals that corporate climate risks reduce the market value of upstream and downstream partners, with the magnitude of this impact varying by ownership structure, size, market power, and geographical proximity. This study provides empirical evidence and theoretical support for quantifying firm-level climate risk, mitigating climate risk shocks in supply chains, and constructing secure and resilient supply chain networks.",2025

This study introduces an innovative online method for financial applications, employing neural bandit algorithms to dynamically optimize soft instruction embeddings based on user feedback, enhancing personalization in white-box LLMs. Through experiments on public generation tasks, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Notably, our NeuralTS implementation achieves up to a 62.9% improvement in ROUGE scores and a 2.76% increase in LLM-agent evaluation for personalized content generation. This research showcases the efficacy of neural bandits in refining LLM outputs to align with client-specific needs and regulatory requirements, marking a pivotal step towards feasible and effective adaptive text generation in finance. Our method offers a promising and scalable solution for financial institutions to enhance client engagement, improve risk assessment, and streamline regulatory reporting.",2024
Nexus between Chat GPT usage dimensions and investment decisions making in Pakistan: Moderating role of financial literacy,"This study's primary goal is to investigate and gain better knowledge of the relationship between ChatGPT usage dimensions such as analyzing data, managing risk, optimizing portfolios, forecasting market trends, and conducting sentiment analysis and investment decisions of investors in the Pakistan stock market, as well as the moderating role of financial literacy. The sample for this study included individual stock market investors in Pakistan. Using a self-administered questionnaire and a cross-sectional design, a non-probability convenience sampling technique followed by snowball techniques was used to collect data from 388 active and potential individual investors. The study's findings showed that ChatGPT usage dimensions have a positive and significant impact on investment decision making. Furthermore, financial literacy is found to moderate the relationship between optimizing portfolios, forecasting market trends, and investment decision making.

How supply chain digitalization investment affects firm's financial and non-financial performance: Evidence from listed companies in China,"Although many studies have focused on the impact of digitalization on firm performance, a definitive conclusion has yet to be reached. This study aims to comprehensively reveal the mechanisms by which SCDI affects firm performance. We employ large language model to identify the annual report information, and measure the SCDI for Chinese listed companies from 2017 to 2022. The empirical results indicate that SCDI contributes to improving supply chain capabilities, including reducing supply chain risk and enhancing supply chain efficiency. However, it also leads to increased financial risk and resource slack. Furthermore, SCDI decreases financial performance but increases non-financial performance. This study is an early attempt to uncover the paradoxical outcomes of SCDI, providing a new explanation of digitalization failure and the mechanisms behind the ITproductivity paradox hypothesis.",2024
Investigating the beneficial impact of segmentation-based modelling for credit scoring,"Due to its vital role in financial risk management, credit scoring has been investigated extensively in extant information systems studies. However, most credit scoring studies rely on one-size-fits-all classifiers with logistic regression (LR) as a popular benchmark. Moreover, extant literature largely focuses on predictive performance as an evaluation criterion. To find a better balance between predictive performance and interpretability though, the current study investigates the beneficial impact of segmentation-based modelling by benchmarking the logit leaf model (LLM) which is based on LR and decision trees. By a large experimental setup using a real-life credit scoring data set containing 65,536 active customers, we find that LLM is a viable classifier over its constituent parts, i.e., LR and decision trees, and is very competitive to state-of-the-art credit decision making techniques (neural networks, support vector machines, bagging, boosting and random forests) on three evaluation metrics (AUC, top-decile lift and profit). Furthermore, we show its extraordinary interpretability capacities by proposing a new visualization based on the LLM output. In sum, the excellence of the LLM as a classifier for credit decision making problems stems from its ability to combine strong predictive performance with interpretable insights that in turn can inform managerial decisions.",2024

The primary objective is to design effective prompts that guide LLMs in distilling verbose and intricate regulatory texts, such as the Basel III capital requirement regulations, into a concise mathematical framework that can be subsequently translated into actionable code. This novel approach aims to streamline the implementation of regulatory mandates within the financial reporting and risk management systems of global banking institutions. A case study was conducted to assess the performance of various LLMs, demonstrating that GPT-4 outperforms other models in processing and collecting necessary information, as well as executing mathematical calculations. The case study utilized numerical simulations with asset holdings including fixed income, equities, currency pairs, and commodities - to demonstrate how LLMs can effectively implement the Basel III capital adequacy requirements.",2024
Advanced Default Risk Prediction in Small and Medum-Sized Enterprises Using Large Language Models,"Predicting default risk in commercial bills for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is crucial, as these enterprises represent one of the largest components of a nation's economic structure, and their financial stability can impact systemic financial risk. However, data on the commercial bills of SMEs are scarce and challenging to gather, which has impeded research on risk prediction for these businesses. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging 38 multi-dimensional, non-financial features collected from 1972 real SMEs in China to predict bill default risk. We identified the most influential factors among these 38 features and introduced a novel prompt-based learning framework using large language models for risk assessment, benchmarking against seven mainstream machine learning algorithms. In the experiments, the XGBoost algorithm achieved the best performance on the Z-Score standardized dataset, with an accuracy of 81.42% and an F1 score of 80%. Additionally, we tested both the standard and fine-tuned versions of the large language model, which yielded accuracies of 75% and 82.1%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed framework has significant potential for predicting risks in SMEs and offers new insights for related research.",2025
"Characterizing, Detecting, and Correcting Comment Errors in Smart Contract Functions","NatSpec comments play an essential role in smart contracts. Their clear and informative format helps users gain an accurate understanding of smart contract functions and diminish financial risk. However, widespread non-adherence to NatSpec standards currently causes confusion for both end-users and developers. Current research often neglects the importance of NatSpec formats or solely emphasizes user-centric comments in smart contract generation. This oversight can hinder contract trustworthiness, code reusability, maintenance efficiency, and ultimately, the development of the community ecosystem. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first empirical study on 253 verified contracts encompassing 16,620 functions from Etherscan, uncovering that 87% of the smart contract functions have Comment Errors (CE) and pinpointing prevalent deviation patterns. Based on our findings, we propose CETerminator, an automated approach for detecting and rectifying CE in smart contract functions. Due to the scarcity of NatSpec-compliant comments for collected smart contract functions, CETerminator employs in-context learning on a large language model to generate NatSpec comments. The approach then compares the original and the generated comments, utilizing corpus-driven heuristic rules to identify and correct diverse error categories in the original comments. In our evaluation, CETerminator demonstrates a high token overlap rate for addressing missing comments. In addition, the average precision, recall, and F1-scores for handling inconsistency comments are 85.28%, 86.48%, and 85.85%, respectively, outperforming the baseline by 39.79%, 39.53%, and 39.84%.",2024
FinCaKG: A Framework to Construct Financial Causality Knowledge Graph from Text,"Causality analysis holds a prominent role in finance, and the presentation of causality could offer valuable insights for risk mitigation and investment decisions. Recent research has extensively investigated the identification of causality from text, yet there is still a significant deficiency in providing a comprehensive causality presentation from those textual discoveries. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework to automatically construct Financial Causality Knowledge Graph (FinCaKG) from text, which allows us to visualize the captured causality from a holistic perspective. This framework involves three distinct tasks, including causality sentence detection, cause-effect span identification, and causal dependency representation. To examine the adaptability of FinCaKG framework, we generate, compare, and analyze the distinct FinCaKGs created from different corpus. The results show that this framework has the capability to not only capture the confidential causality but also represent them in a highly detailed manner in the resulting knowledge graphs. We perform a comparative study with ConceptNet, revealing the notable contributions of FinCaKGs in terms of domain coverage and the density of its causal knowledge. Furthermore, we implement two case studies to examine the capability of financial role declaration and distinction of ChatGPT and FinCaKGs applications. We found that, compared to ChatGPT, FinCaKGs are able to represent the much clearer and more distinctive logic opinions among diverse financial roles. The related resources will be available in the webpage https://www.ai.iee.e.titech.ac.jp/FinCaKG/.",2025
Artificial intelligence: Can it help us better grasp the idea of epilepsy? An exploratory dialogue with ChatGPT and DALL•E 2,"Background: The conceptual definition of epilepsy has been changing over decades and remains debatable. We assessed how artificial intelligence (AI) conceives epilepsy and its impact on a person's life through verbal and visual material. Methods: We asked the Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI) to define epilepsy and its impact. Prompts from ChatGPT were transferred to another AI tool DALL center dot E 2 (Open AI) to generate visual images based on verbal input. Results: The ChatGPT definition on epilepsy relied on both its conceptual and practical definitions. It titled epilepsy to be a neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures that has significant impact on patients' lives and is diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures or if there is a high risk of future seizures. ChatGPT presented nine issues - seizure-related injuries, limitations on daily activities, emotional and psychological impact, social stigma and isolation, educational and employment challenges, relationship and family dynamics, medication side effects, financial burden, and coexisting conditions - as major consequences of epilepsy. AIgenerated images ranged from direct portrayals of these phenomena to abstract imagery but were mostly deprived of symbolic elements and visual metaphors. Conclusion: We showed that AI can identify and visually interpret the burden of epilepsy from medical, societal and economical perspectives. However, the imagery created is not figurative and does not follow allegorical narratives put forward by epilepsy specialists in similar studies. The ability of AI models to lead an in-depth discussion on epilepsy remains questionable and should be explored with more advanced AI tools.",2024
ChatGPT for Addressing Patient-centered Frequently Asked Questions in Glaucoma Clinical Practice,"Purpose: Large language models such as ChatGPT-3.5 are often used by the public to answer questions related to daily life, including health advice. This study evaluated the responses of ChatGPT-3.5 in answering patient-centered frequently asked questions (FAQs) relevant in glaucoma clinical practice. Design: Prospective cross-sectional survey. Participants: Expert graders. Methods: Twelve experts across a range of clinical, education, and research practices in optometry and ophthalmology. Over 200 patient-centric FAQs from authoritative professional society, hospital and advocacy websites were distilled and filtered into 40 questions across 4 themes: definition and risk factors, diagnosis and testing, lifestyle and other accompanying conditions, and treatment and follow-up. The questions were individually input into ChatGPT-3.5 to generate responses. The responses were graded by the 12 experts individually. Main Outcome Measures: A 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) was used to grade ChatGPT-3.5 responses across 4 domains: coherency, factuality, comprehensiveness, and safety. Results: Across all themes and domains, median scores were all 4 (agree). Comprehensiveness had the lowest scores across domains (mean 3.7 +/- 0.9), followed by factuality (mean 3.9 +/- 0.9) and coherency and safety (mean 4.1 +/- 0.8 for both). Examination of the individual 40 questions showed that 8 (20%), 17 (42.5%), 24 (60%), and 8 (20%) of the questions had average scores below 4 (i.e., below agree) for the coherency, factuality, comprehensiveness, and safety domains, respectively. Free-text comments by the experts highlighted omissions of facts and comprehensiveness (e.g., secondary glaucoma) and remarked on the vagueness of some responses (i.e., that the response did not account for individual patient circumstances). Conclusions: ChatGPT-3.5 responses to FAQs in glaucoma were generally agreeable in terms of coherency, factuality, comprehensiveness, and safety. However, areas of weakness were identified, precluding recommendations for routine use to provide patients with tailored counseling in glaucoma, especially with respect to development of glaucoma and its management.

"ESGify: Automated Classification of Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Risks","The growing recognition of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in financial decision-making has spurred the need for effective and comprehensive ESG risk assessment tools. In this study, we introduce an open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, ESGify1,2, based on MPNet-base architecture and aimed to classify texts within the frames of ESG risks. We also present a hierarchical and detailed methodology for ESG risk classification, leveraging the expertise of ESG professionals and global best practices. Anchored by a manually annotated multilabel dataset of 2000 news articles and domain adaptation with texts of sustainability reports, ESGify is developed to automate ESG risk classification following the established methodology. We compare augmentation techniques based on back translation and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the model quality and achieve 0.5 F1-weighted model quality in the dataset with 47 classes. This result outperforms ChatGPT 3.5 with a simple prompt. The model weights and documentation is hosted on Github https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/ESGify under the Apache 2.0 license.",2023
Using AI to assess corporate climate transition disclosures,"Company transition plans toward a low-carbon economy are key for effective capital allocation and risk management. This paper proposes a set of 64 indicators to comprehensively assess transition plans and develops a Large Language Model-based tool to automate the assessment of company disclosures. We evaluate our tool with experts from 26 institutions, including financial regulators, investors, and non-governmental organizations. We apply the tool to the sustainability reports from carbon-intensive Climate Action 100+ companies. Our results show that companies tend to disclose more information related to target setting (talk), but less information related to the concrete implementation of strategies (walk). In addition, companies that disclose more information tend to have lower emissions. Our results highlight the need for increased scrutiny of companies' efforts and potential greenwashing risks. The complexity of transition activities presents a major challenge for comprehensive large-scale assessments. As shown in this paper, novel and flexible approaches using Large Language Models can serve as a remedy.",2025
"Managerial sentiment, life cycle and corporate investment: a large language model approach","PurposeThis paper investigates the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment in emerging capital markets. Further, we begin with the assertion that the positive impact of managerial sentiment on corporate investment varies according to the corporate life cycle. Lastly, we investigate whether the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment can be moderated by factors like (1) economic policy uncertainty/geo-political risk, (2) size of the firm, (3) financial constraint, (4) industrial competition, and (5) Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) rating.Design/methodology/approachThis study has considered Indian listed companies (465 firms) for the period spanning from 2003-2004 to 2022-2023. This study constructs the managerial sentiment using a novel large language model-financial bidirectional encoder representation from the Transformers (FinBERT), as well as on management discussion and analysis reports. Then, we employ fixed effect regression to investigate the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment. Additionally, we use propensity score matching, two-stage least squares instrumental variables, and a two-step system generalized method of moments approach for robustness tests.FindingsThe findings show a positive and significant relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment. Additionally, our results demonstrate that this relationship is evident only during the growth and maturity phase of the corporate life cycle. Moreover, uncertainty pertaining to the economy and geopolitical issues, firm size, financial health, industry dynamics, and ESG disclosure also play a crucial role in shaping the investment-sentiment relationship.Originality/valueThe study is unique because it determines the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment by using the novel FinBERT model. In addition, we have introduced a corporate life cycle, which is an essential aspect of our study. Additionally, this research was conducted in an emerging market with more information asymmetry and weaker disclosure rules. Thus, other emerging markets can benchmark the outcomes.",2025
"Sarcocystis spp. in llamas (Lama glama) in Southern Bolivia: A cross sectional study of the prevalence, risk factors and loss in income caused by carcass downgrades","Llamas (Lama glama) are intermediate hosts of the protozoan parasite Sarcocystis spp. This parasite is described as causing economic losses in the production of llama meat in South America. The aim of this study was to estimate prevalence, identify risk factors and explore spatial patterns of Sarcocystis in llamas in an area of the Bolivian High Plateau including estimating financial losses due to carcass downgrades as a result of the presence of Sarcocystis cysts. Information was collected from a local abattoir between 2006 and 2011 on 1196 llamas. Sarcocystis status was determined at meat inspection where any carcasses with one or more visible cysts were deemed Sarcocystis positive. A high prevalence was found, estimated to vary between 23.4% (95% CI 16.6-30.1) in 2007 and 50.3% (95% CI 44.4-56.3) in 2011. Period prevalence between 2006 and 2011 was estimated at 34.1% (95% Cl 31.4-36.8). Age, sex and type (analogous to breed) were identified as risk factors for Sarcocystis using a mixed-effects logistic regression model adjusting for clustering by community and owner. Llamas over 4.5 years of age had an increased odds of being Sarcocystis positive (OR 19.31,95% CI 9.10-40.98) as well as females (OR 1.75,95% CI 1.13-2.68) and long haired type llamas (OR 1.90,95% CI 1.26-2.87). An interaction between age and sex was detected indicating that the increased odds of disease from the youngest age group to the 2.5-4.5 years group was much more pronounced in females than in males. Spatial patterns of Sarcocystis were explored at district level by means of Standardised Morbidity Ratios and some spatial heterogeneity was revealed. Estimates of financial loss due to the disease were calculated using the difference in price paid for Sarcocystis positive and negative meat. Loss due to Sarcocystis varied per year but could be up to 20% of the annual income generated through the abattoir by sale of meat. Overall this study shows a high prevalence of Sarcocystis in the study area with some heterogeneity between districts. It also identifies some previously unknown risk factors for Sarcocystis and gives financial estimates of the cost of the disease as a result of carcass downgrades. We hoped these findings will add to the understanding of Sarcocystis in llamas in Southern Bolivia and will be useful when considering if controls are necessary, worthwhile and practical.
