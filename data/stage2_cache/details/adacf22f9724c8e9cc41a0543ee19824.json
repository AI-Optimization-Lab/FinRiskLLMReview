    "title": "Study on Improvement and Risk Assessment of Marine Logistics Finance Development Model Based on the Background of Free Trade Zone Construction",
    "abstract": "The free trade area has a more important impact on the marine logistics industry, promoting the country's re-export trade, offshore trade, offshore finance, and shipping services. Through the determination of maritime logistics enterprises, this paper provides a method for the determination of the comprehensive risk value of logistics financial business. Through the establishment of the risk evaluation model by the wavelet support vector regression algorithm, from the development of the comprehensive value-at-risk business, the paper summarizes the concepts, practice forms, development process, and important relations of the relevant trade and shipping logistics industry and the foreign free trade zone.",
