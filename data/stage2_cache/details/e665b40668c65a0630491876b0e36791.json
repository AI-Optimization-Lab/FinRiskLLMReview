    "title": "Neural networks in condition monitoring - Just another fad?",
    "abstract": "In the last few years, neural computing has developed into an established technology in certain areas, such as financial risk assessment. Many papers have been published on the theory of neural networks, and a considerable number have discussed the application of neural networks in condition monitoring. However, the technology has yet to make a real impact on the real world of industrial plant maintenance. Are neural networks just another fad - as some have argued is the case with expert systems? This paper discusses the application of neural networks in real condition monitoring implementations, and the issues which must be addressed in order to develop a successful neural network system. The paper examines why much of the published literature does not reflect the real problems of deploying a neural computing solution in a real maintenance environment. Fundamental issues such as the selection of the right type of neural network, or the need for pre-processing of the data, are discussed in depth, and some solutions and recommendations are presented. The paper uses real world examples of successful implementations of neural networks in condition monitoring applications to illustrate the points raised.",
