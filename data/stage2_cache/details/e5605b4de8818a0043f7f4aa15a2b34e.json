    "title": "Beating a Benchmark: Dynamic Programming May Not Be the Right Numerical Approach",
    "abstract": "We analyze dynamic investment strategies for benchmark outperformance using two widely used objectives of practical interest to investors: (i) maximizing the information ratio (IR), and (ii) ob-taining a favorable tracking difference (cumulative outperformance) relative to the benchmark. In the case of the tracking difference, we propose a simple and intuitive objective function based on the quadratic deviation (QD) from an elevated benchmark. In order to gain some intuition about these strategies, we provide closed-form solutions for the controls under idealized assumptions. For more realistic cases, we represent the control using a neural network (NN) and directly solve a sampled optimization problem, which approximates the original optimal stochastic control formulation. Un-like the typical approach based on dynamic programming (DP), e.g., reinforcement learning, solving the sampled optimization with an NN as a control avoids computing conditional expectations and leads to an optimization problem with a small number of variables. In addition, our NN param-eter size is independent of the number of portfolio rebalancing times. Under some assumptions, we prove that a traditional DP approach results in a high-dimensional problem, whereas directly solving for the control without using DP yields a low-dimensional problem. Our analytical and numerical results illustrate that, compared with IR-optimal strategies with the same expected value of terminal wealth, the QD-optimal investment strategies result in comparatively more diversified asset allocations during certain periods of the investment time horizon.",
