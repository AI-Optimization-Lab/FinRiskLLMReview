The attribution of credit ratings for companies in developed model involves 2 stages. The first is the classification of companies into default and non-default groups by logistic regression model. The second is attribution of credit ratings for companies that by logistic regression model were classified as non-default. The analysis of the parameters of loan portfolio affirmed the validity to use the model in credit risk assessment.
