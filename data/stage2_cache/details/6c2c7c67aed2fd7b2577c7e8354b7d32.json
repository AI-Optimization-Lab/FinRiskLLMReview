    "abstract": "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease incidence has risen mainly due to poor control of preventable risk factors and still constitutes a significant financial and health burden worldwide. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence language-based model developed by OpenAI. Due to the model's unique cognitive capabilities beyond data processing and the production of high-quality text, there has been a surge of research interest concerning its role in the scientific community and contemporary clinical practice. To fully exploit ChatGPT's potential benefits and reduce its possible misuse, extreme caution must be taken to ensure its implications ethically and equitably. In this narrative review, we explore the language model's possible applications and limitations while emphasizing its potential value for diagnosing, managing, and prognosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.",
