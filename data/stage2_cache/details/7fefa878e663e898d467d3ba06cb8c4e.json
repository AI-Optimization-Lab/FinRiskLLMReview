    "title": "Who Uses Mobile Payments: Fintech Potential in Users and Non-Users",
    "abstract": "This study used data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to analyze the adoption of mobile payments by U.S. households. While 24% of respondents used mobile payments, the mean rate for those under age 25 was 11 times the rate for those 65 and older State rates ranged from about 9% in Montana to 34% in Washington, DC. Based on a logistic regression, age and an objective financial knowledge score were negatively while risk tolerance and a subjective financial knowledge score were positively related to mobile payment use. The results have implications for marketing of Fintech applications for personal finance, especially in terms of the extremely low mobile payment use by older consumers.",
