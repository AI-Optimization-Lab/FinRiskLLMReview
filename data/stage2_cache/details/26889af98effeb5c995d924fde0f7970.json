    "title": "A Data-Driven, Farmer-Oriented Agricultural Crop Recommendation Engine (ACRE)",
    "abstract": "Agriculture has a significant role to play in any emerging economy and provides the source of income and employment for a large portion of the population. A key challenge faced by small and marginal farmers is to determine which crops to grow to maximize their utililty. With a wrong choice of crops, farmers could end up with sub-optimal yields and low, and possibly even loss of revenue. This work seeks to design and develop ACRE (Agricultural Crop Recommendation Engine), a tool that provides a scientific method to choose a crop or a portfolio of crops, to maximize the utility to the farmer. ACRE uses available data such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and historical yield data, and uses state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning models to compute an estimated utility to the farmer. The main idea of ACRE is to generate several recommendations of portfolios of crops, with a ranking of portfolios based on the Sharpe ratio, a popular risk metric in financial investments. We use publicly available data from agmarknet portal in India to perform several thought experiments with ACRE. ACRE provides a rigorous, data-driven backend for designing farmer-friendly mobile apps for assisting farmers in choosing crops (This work was supported by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Government of India, through a research grant).",
