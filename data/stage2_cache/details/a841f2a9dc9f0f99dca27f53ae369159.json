    "title": "A three-level nested portfolio optimization model with position allocation",
    "abstract": "Existing portfolio optimization models cannot well capture the real position allocation requirement, leading to limited impact in practice. To overcome this challenge, we propose a three-level nested portfolio optimization model with position allocation. Within this model, the inner and middle levels collaboratively determine the optimal portfolio, while the outer level focuses on optimizing the holding proportion of each stock in the optimal portfolio. Compared with existing models with portfolio weights, the proposed model imposes the position allocation constraint that precisely characterizes the limitations on holding each stock. This constraint is crucial for investors to obey securities trading regulations involving position limitations and to mitigate the potential impact of market risks. To address the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the novel model, we develop an intelligent optimization algorithm by effectively hybridizing the support vector regression and the enhanced grey wolf optimizer. We comprehensively evaluate its performance using eight metrics, including accumulative return, annual return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, absolute and relative win ratios, predictive precision and accuracy. The experimental results indicate that (i) the proposed model can achieve more excess returns than those stock selection models not considering position allocation, especially for the large-cap stocks; (ii) compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the enhanced grey wolf optimizer can yield better portfolio in conjunction with the support vector regression; (iii) in the context of the Chinese A-share stock market, specific financial indicators such as return on equity, inventory turnover rate, net income growth rate, and debt-to-equity ratio should be given greater consideration compared to other financial metrics.",
