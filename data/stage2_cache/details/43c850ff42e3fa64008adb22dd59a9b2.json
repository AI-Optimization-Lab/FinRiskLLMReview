    "title": "BEYOND WORD-LEVEL TO SENTENCE-LEVEL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTS",
    "abstract": "This paper attempts to conduct a sentence-level sentiment analysis with respect to financial risk on a collection of financial reports. Specifically, we first propose a simple yet efficient algorithm to generate financial sentiment phrases (senti-phrases), and then with the obtained senti-phrases, we utilize multiple sentence embedding models for better learning the representations of financial risk sentences. In order to verify the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct a risk classification task of financial sentences on a sentence-level labeled dataset of finance reports. Experimental results show that incorporating the obtained senti-phrases into the embedding-based models improves the classification performance.",
