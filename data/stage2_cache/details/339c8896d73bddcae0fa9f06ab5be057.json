    "title": "A hybrid intelligent method for mean-absolute downside deviation dynamic portfolio",
    "abstract": "A multi-period mean-absolute downside deviation portfolio selection is a dynamic stochastic programming problem. In financial market with box constraints, the analytical solution of this problem is very difficult to acquire by conventional methods. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intelligent method in which both a chaos genetic algorithm, based on stochastic simulation, and an artificial neural network are applied to solving the dynamic stochastic programming. The efficient frontier of the multi-period portfolio selection is obtained by this method. An illustrative case shows that the hybrid intelligent method is efficient and effective.",
