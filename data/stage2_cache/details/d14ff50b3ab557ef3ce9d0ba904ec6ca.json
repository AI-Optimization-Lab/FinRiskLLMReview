    "abstract": "The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) represents a popular risk measure often exploited e.g. within portfolio optimization. The situation with a nuisance linear regression is considered here; in other words, we do not observe directly the loss Z of interest, but only Y = beta 0+ X beta+Z, where the covariates are not under our control. We propose a novel estimator of CVaR(Z) based on the averaged two-step regression quantile combined with an R-estimate of regression parameters.",
