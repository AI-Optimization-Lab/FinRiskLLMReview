    "title": "Comparison of Transfer Learning Model Accuracy for Osteoporosis Classification on Knee Radiograph",
    "abstract": "In terms of financial costs and human suffering, osteoporosis poses a serious public health burden. Reduced bone mass, degeneration of the microarchitecture of bone tissue, and an increased risk of fracture are its main skeletal symptoms. Osteoporosis is caused not just by low bone mineral density, but also by other factors such as age, weight, height, and lifestyle. Recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to successful applications of expert systems that use Deep Learning techniques for osteoporosis diagnosis based on some modalities such as dental radiographs amongst others. This study uses a dataset of knee radiographs (i.e., knee-Xray images) to apply and compare three robust transfer learning model algorithms: GoogLeNet, VGG-16, and ResNet50 to classify osteoporosis. From the statistical analysis and scikit learn python analysis, the accuracy of the GoogLeNet model was 90%, the accuracy of the VGG-16 model was 87% and lastly, the accuracy of the ResNet50 model was 83%.",
