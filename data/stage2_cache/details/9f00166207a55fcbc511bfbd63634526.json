    "title": "The association between sociodemographic inequalities, COVID-related impacts and mental health",
    "abstract": "Purpose: There are concerns that the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 are unevenly distributed, exacerbating existing inequalities. Here we tested the hypotheses that: (H1) the magnitude of these impacts would be associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety early in the pandemic, and (H2) that these impacts would be associated with a range of sociodemographic risk factors. Methods: Cross-sectional self-report data were collected from a UK sample (N = 632) between the 16th of May and 21st of July 2020, coinciding with the early stages of the pandemic and first UK lockdown. Data were collected on COVID-19 related impacts including financial and social stressors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sociodemographic/economic risk factors operationalised at multiple levels including the indi-vidual, familial, household and neighbourhood.Results: Using regression analyses both financial and social impacts were independently associated with anxiety (R2 = 0.23) and depression scores (R2 = 0.24), as well as clinically significant generalised anxiety (R2 = 0.14) and depression (R2 = 0.11). In addition, many sociodemographic factors were associated with elevated levels of COVID-19 related impacts, including being younger, female, having lower educational attainment and lower income. Limitations: The main limitations of the study were its modest sample size, cross sectional design (which pre-cluded inferences about directions of causality), and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the sample (which limited generalisability).Conclusions: These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, and further, point to particular groups that should be supported by post-COVID-19 recovery policies and initiatives.",
