    "title": "Mitigating margin procyclicality: the effectiveness of anti-procyclicality measures during the Covid-19 stress event",
    "abstract": "The pronounced volatility of initial margins during the Covid-19 stress event revived discussions on regulatory measures to limit potential adverse effects on market liq-uidity. Anti-procyclicality (APC) tools are meant to tackle this problem by damp-ening margin dynamics that could otherwise create liquidity strain during periods of market stress. In this paper we use daily portfolio-level data (collected under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation) to analyze the effectiveness of APC measures implemented by central counterparties for clearing member and client mar-gins. Using simulation, we show that the effectiveness of the APC measure is highly sensitive to the details of calibration and to the type of portfolios to which the mea-sure is applied. Employing a regression analysis, we then quantify the relative ability of APC measures to limit portfolio margin growth during the Covid-19 stress period, controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. This approach reveals that models that have implemented margin floors displayed lower levels of margin growth during the Covid-19 stress. We conclude with a policy discussion on the benefits of margin model transparency and advocate for the provision of additional regulatory guidance on the implementation of APC measures.",
