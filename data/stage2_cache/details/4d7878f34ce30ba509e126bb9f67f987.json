    "title": "ON OPTIMAL TRACKING PORTFOLIO IN INCOMPLETE MARKETS: THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH",
    "abstract": "This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal tracking portfolio problem using capital injection in incomplete market models. The benchmark process is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion with zero drift driven by some unhedgeable risk. The relaxed tracking formulation is adopted where the fund account is compensated by the injected capital needs to outperform the benchmark process at any time, and the goal is to minimize the cost of the discounted total capital injection. When model parameters are known, we formulate the equivalent auxiliary control problem with reflected state dynamics, for which the classical solution of the HJB equation with Neumann boundary condition is obtained explicitly. When model parameters are unknown, we introduce the exploratory formulation for the auxiliary control problem with entropy regularization and develop the continuous-time q-learning algorithm in models of reflected diffusion processes. In some illustrative numerical examples, we show the satisfactory performance of the q-learning algorithm.",
