    "title": "Further Study on Futures Pricing based on Time Factor: Taking Copper in SHFE as an Example",
    "abstract": "To disclose the relationship between futures price and spot prices, the paper starts with the basic pricing formula of futures contract to deduce a general econometric equation which directly includes the time factor. The paper also analyzes the implication of each parameter such as intercept, elasticity and convenience yield respectively marked as alpha, beta and gamma. Then based on data set since June 2001 we respectively make a regression for each year and the result demonstrates the trend characteristic of Copper pricing in SHFE is directly determined by the Copper trade's supply and demand pattern under the new world economic situation. In addition, the paper finds out the pricing law was very disordered in 2004 and explains this anomalous phenomenon from the perspective of State Reserve Bureau's market intervention in 2004.",
