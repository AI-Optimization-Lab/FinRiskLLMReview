    "title": "EARTH OBSERVATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED FOR LAND WASTE DETECTION AND MONITORING",
    "abstract": "The dramatic increase in the amount of waste produced globally has an undeniable negative effect on the environment. The accelerated pace of urban development, the increase in consumption and the large scale of industrial activities have led to a rapid accumulation of waste in more or less proper waste dumps. All member states of the European Union are required to comply with waste management regulations, which primarily provide for the prevention of illegal dumping of any type of waste, its disposal in compliant landfills and their regular monitoring. In our ongoing project we aim to support waste management activities by proposing practical ways for Earth observation data to be used in off-site waste detection and monitoring of known landfills. Our research focuses on assessing the state of the art in earth applications techniques such as artificial intelligence/ machine learning that are currently being used for waste management and proposing approaches for building up a portfolio of scalable solutions that will support waste management not only in Romania but also at a regional, European, or global level. This work was supported by a grant of the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CCCDI -UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P2-2.1-PTE-2021-0432, within PNCDI III.",
