    "title": "An empirical research of B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation",
    "abstract": "Based on the concept of B2C enterprise strategic risk, a risk evaluation index system is set up which consists of five elements, including financial condition, market competition, enterprise resource, enterprise capability and business process, firstly. Secondly, a corresponding comprehensive evaluation method based on Particle Swarm Optimisation-Wavelet Neural Network (PSO-WNN) is proposed in detail for B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation. Finally, an empirical research for B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation was discussed using the suggested method. The simulation results show that the level of B2C enterprise strategic risk can be evaluated quantitatively by the PSO-WNN model proposed in this paper and the shortcomings of current assessment methods, such as more subjectivity, randomness and fuzzy conclusion, can be overcome. In addition, the comparison between the mentioned approach and WNN was made, and finally it was concluded that PSO-WNN has better learning ability and more fast convergence rate than that of WNN.",
