    "title": "Financial distress prediction with optimaldecision trees based on the optimalsampling probability",
    "abstract": "Financial distress prediction plays an important role in the decision-making processof stock and bond investors, commercial banks and commercial credit adjusters. Theeffectiveness of financial distress prediction depends on the processing of sampledata and the reasonable integration of multiple prediction results. The main contri-bution of this paper is a novel tree-based ensemble model for financial distress pre-diction. We obtain multiple balanced samples with different sampling probabilities.The optimal sampling probability is determined by the maximum geometric-meanvalues, and we construct optimal decision tree models based on the optimal balancedsamples with the optimal sampling probability. The model validation is based on asample of Chinese listed companies. We also validate the effectiveness of the modelin different time windows. The empirical results show that the financial distress pre-diction performance of the proposed model exceeds that of the comparison models indifferent time windows. This model can contribute toward better credit risk analysisand management",
