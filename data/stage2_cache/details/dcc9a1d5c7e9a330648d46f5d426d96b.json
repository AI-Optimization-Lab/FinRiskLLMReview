    "abstract": "Financial failure prediction can provide early warning signal, thus is help for controlling financial risk. This paper investigates the effectiveness of intelligent classification methods in predicting financial failure of listed companies. The empirical result indicates that the prediction accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) is higher than that of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and decision tree (DT) and Logit. Because of the structure risk minimization principle(SRM), SVM can still preserve prediction good performance despite small sample of Chinese special treated companies. DT can discover useful knowledge for financial failure decision.",
