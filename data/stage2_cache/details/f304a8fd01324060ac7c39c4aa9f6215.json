    "title": "A CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF POLISH STOCK COMPANIES WITH A METHOD BASED ON FIREFLY ALGORITHM",
    "abstract": "Cluster analysis is an important category of data mining issues. Clustering techniques are frequently applied also in business and economy, for example in customer's classification, enterprises grouping or in other economic data analyses. The paper submits a new clustering method, which we have named Firefly Clustering Algorithm (FCA), based on a recently developed and commonly applied optimisation technique - Firefly Algorithm (FA) that simulates natural behaviour of living fireflies. After brief presentation of the original idea of classical FA as an optimisation technique, we submit the description of FCA - the proposed clustering method. The algorithm has been implemented in form of our computer program written in C++. Next we show a financial utilisation of FCA as a tool for cluster analysis of selected stock companies quoted on Warsaw Stock Exchange, with taking into account two factors (as input variables): return rate and risk. Results have been visualised and discussed. Directions of further researches have been outlined. Although here we have considered a 2-dimensional problem (i.e. a dataset with only 2 numerical features), the presented FCA method is universal and can be applied for any number of inputs (obviously with limited visualisation capabilities).",
