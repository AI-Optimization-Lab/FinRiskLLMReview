    "title": "Risk Identification Model of Enterprise Strategic Financing Based on Online Learning",
    "abstract": "The current financing risk identification model only identifies according to the financial situation of enterprises. The limitations of risk indicators affect the accuracy of identification, and have great limitations for enterprises in different industries. In view of the above problems, this paper will study and build an enterprise strategic financing risk identification model based on online learning. After analyzing the causes of enterprise strategic financing risk, the financing risk identification index system is designed. Based on the structure of impulse neural network, the risk identification model is constructed by using online learning algorithm. The model test results show that the minimum identification accuracy of the model is 92.4%, which has a good risk identification effect for enterprises in different industries.",
