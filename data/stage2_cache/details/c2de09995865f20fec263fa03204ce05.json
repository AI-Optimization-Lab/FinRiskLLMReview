    "title": "Predicting China's SME Credit Risk in Supply Chain Financing by Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network and Hybrid Models",
    "abstract": "Based on logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, we construct an LR model, an ANN model and three types of a two-stage hybrid model. The two-stage hybrid model is integrated by the LR and ANN approaches. We predict the credit risk of China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for financial institutions (FIs) in the supply chain financing (SCF) by applying the above models. In the empirical analysis, the quarterly financial and non-financial data of 77 listed SMEs and 11 listed core enterprises (CEs) in the period of 2012-2013 are chosen as the samples. The empirical results show that: (i) the negative signal prediction accuracy ratio of the ANN model is better than that of LR model; (ii) the two-stage hybrid model type I has a better performance of predicting positive signals than that of the ANN model; (iii) the two-stage hybrid model type II has a stronger ability both in aspects of predicting positive signals and negative signals than that of the two-stage hybrid model type I; and (iv) negative signal predictive power of the two-stage hybrid model type III is stronger than that of the two-stage hybrid model type II. In summary, the two-stage hybrid model III has the best classification capability to forecast SMEs credit risk in SCF, which can be a useful prediction tool for China's FIs.",
