    "title": "EX-DRL: Hedging Against Heavy Losses with EXtreme Distributional Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for modeling loss distributions have shown promise in developing hedging strategies in derivatives markets. A common approach in DRL involves learning the quantiles of loss distributions at specified levels using Quantile Regression (QR). This method is particularly effective in option hedging due to its direct quantile-based risk assessment, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, these risk measures depend on the accurate estimation of extreme quantiles in the loss distribution's tail, which can be imprecise in QR-based DRL due to the rarity and extremity of tail data, as highlighted in the literature. To address this issue, we propose EXtreme DRL (EX-DRL), which enhances extreme quantile prediction by modeling the tail of the loss distribution with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This method introduces supplementary data to mitigate the scarcity of extreme quantile observations, thereby improving estimation accuracy through QR. Comprehensive experiments on gamma hedging options demonstrate that EX-DRL improves existing QR-based models by providing more precise estimates of extreme quantiles, thereby improving the computation and reliability of risk metrics for complex financial risk management. The implementation is available here.",
