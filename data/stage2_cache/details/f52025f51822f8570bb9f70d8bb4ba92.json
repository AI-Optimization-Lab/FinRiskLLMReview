    "title": "Alternative Credit Scoring and Classification Employing Machine Learning Techniques on a Big Data Platform",
    "abstract": "With the bloom of financial technology and innovations aiming to deliver a high standard of financial services, banks and credit service companies, along with other financial institutions, use the most recent technologies available in a variety of ways from addressing the information asymmetry, matching the needs of borrowers and lenders, to facilitating transactions using payment services. In the long list of FinTechs, one of the most attractive platforms is the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending which aims to bring the investors and borrowers hand in hand, leaving out the traditional intermediaries like banks. The main purpose of a financial institution as an intermediary is of controlling risk and P2P lending platforms innovate and use new ways of risk assessment. In the era of Big Data, using a diverse source of information from spending behaviors of customers, social media behavior, and geographic information along with traditional methods for credit scoring prove to have new insights for the proper and more accurate credit scoring. In this study, we investigate the machine learning techniques on big data platforms, analyzing the credit scoring methods. It has been concluded that on a HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) environment, Logistic Regression performs better than Decision Tree and Random Forest for credit scoring and classification considering performance metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall, and the overall run time of algorithms. Logistic Regression also performs better in time in a single node HDFS configuration compared to a non-HDFS configuration.",
