    "title": "An analysis on foreign currencies using the referential hierarchical clustering algorithm",
    "abstract": "Formal financial forecast researches use statistical analysis and data mining as research tools. Since most investment subjects are influenced by people, economics, politics and other changing factors, such as stocks, currencies, funds and financial derivatives, therefore, the efficiency of selecting investment object is an important issue. This research emphasize on the issue of how to select the investment objects efficiently by integrating Referential Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (RHA) to analyze 11 different currencies such as the AUD, CNY, IDR, THB, MYR, SGD, JPY, CAD, GBP, HKD, and KRW. The analysis result from the selecting investment objects will be also compared by factor analysis. The clustering result shows that RHA can be used to analyze the risk correlation between various currencies, and also produce the tree structured similarity association map. The tree structured similarity association map shows the similar degree of each node, which can improve the time and efficiency on selecting the investment object.",
