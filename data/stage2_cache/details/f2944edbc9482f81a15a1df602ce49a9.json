    "title": "Logistics Finance Risk Evaluation Model for Coastal Free Trade Cities",
    "abstract": "This article introduces the possible risks that might be encountered during the process of logistics financial services in coastal free trade and analyzes the main factors of risk to construct an integrated logistics finance risk evaluation index system. Then, illustrated by certain coastal port city, we adopt BP neural network to establish the logistics risk evaluation model. The network gets full training and testing using the structure, form and training principle of BP neural network. Therfore, the model can provide accurate evaluation on logistics finance risk of this area and provide successful experiences for the development of logistics enterprises.",
