    "title": "Analyzing the Relationship between the Features of Direct Real Estate Assets and Their Corresponding Australian-REITs",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between a sector-specific Australian Real Estate Investment Trust (A-REITs) and the underlying property assets in its property portfolio. The existing studies have assessed the connectedness/correlation between the A-REITs market and a variety of other asset markets, including the overall stock, bond, and direct real estate markets. This study applied regression analysis methods and discovered that there exists a certain degree of linear correlation between the underlying property assets and the return of the subject A-REITs. The most significant variable is the occupancy of the offices. The higher the occupancy is, the better the dividend can be. Features of the A-REITs also affect the dividend outcomes, specifically, the total portfolio market value and the capitalization rate. This suggests that the annual valuation outcomes show a positive relation with the performance of the A-REITs.",
