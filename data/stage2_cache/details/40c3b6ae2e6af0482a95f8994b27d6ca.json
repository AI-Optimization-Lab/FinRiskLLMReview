    "title": "A mathematical model of utility for single screening of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms at the age of 50 years",
    "abstract": "Although rupture of intracranial aneurysms carries high mortality and morbidity rates, the clinical and financial benefit of screening certain high-risk groups is uncertain. We designed a mathematical model to interrogate the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of screening. A decision tree analysis model was used to calculate the outcome and cost of two scenarios applied to the same population: one-off screening for intracranial aneurysms versus not screening. Each scenario had an associated gain or loss of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) and cost; the difference between the two scenarios was calculated. The variable inputs were the aneurysm prevalence and risk of rupture after 5 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of altering various factors on outcomes. Screening of the asymptomatic general population results in a QALY loss, equating to a negative clinical impact. The threshold 5-year risk of rupture at which screening resulted in a gain in QALYs was 13 %. This held true for any prevalence between 1 and 25 %. Risk of rupture had a greater impact on outcome than prevalence. Halving the risk of intervention (either surgery or coiling) reduced the threshold 5-year risk of rupture at which screening results in gain of QALYs to 6 %. The age of screening also had important effects on outcome. The QALY benefit and cost-effectiveness of screening are most sensitive to the 5-year risk of rupture. Screening is beneficial only in populations with a high risk of rupture; this should be the focus of future research.",
