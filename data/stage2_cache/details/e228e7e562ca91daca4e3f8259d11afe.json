    "title": "EXPLANATORY FACTORS OF LEASE DISCLOSURE LEVEL OF BANKS: CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE EVIDENCE",
    "abstract": "Leasing is a financial instrument commonly used in the banking industry. It provides flexibility and enables banks to address the issue of obsolescence and residual value risk. The objective of this paper is to analyze how several variables influence lease disclosure practices of banks in Central and Eastern Europe. This study employs first a content analysis on the annual financial statements. In doing so, a disclosure checklist is created and applied. Then, two empirical models are estimated by applying simple and multiple linear regressions. The application of the simple linear regression suggests that four of the five hypotheses tested are valid. The size of the bank classified upon the value of its total assets, the audit firm and the listed status of the bank show positive effects on the lease disclosure level, while the country variable has a negative effect. The models used for the multiple linear regression show a relatively low explanatory power and thus, we concluded that none of the defined hypotheses is valid.",
