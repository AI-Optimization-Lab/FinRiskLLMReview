Methods: To conduct the research we have used the data of Slovak enterprises, obtained from annual financial reports covering the year 2015 and the calculated financial ratios of profitability, activity, liquidity and indebtedness that may affect the financial health of the company were applied in the regression analysis. Realizing the multiple regression analysis, the statistically significant determinants that affect the future financial development of the company are identified. as well its the regression model of the bankruptcy prediction. Findings & Value added: In the research aimed at the management of financial risks in Slovak enterprises, IA e focused on the revelation of significant economic risk factors using multiple regression. I he results suggest that the most significant predictors are net return on capital, cash ratio, quick ratio, current ratio, net working capital, RE/TA ratio, current debt ratio, financial debt ratio and current assets turnover based on which the decision about the future company default can be made. These factors are significant enough to manage financial risks and to affect the profitability and prosperity of the company.",
