    "title": "Data-Driven Risk Warning Model for Pension Financial System Based on Fuzzy Neural Network",
    "abstract": "The current pension financial system faces multiple risks, including market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Traditional risk assessment methods are difficult to capture these risks comprehensively and dynamically. Therefore, through literature review and expert consultation, this study systematically established a set of early warning index system covering macroeconomic environment, financial market conditions, operation conditions of pension financial institutions and policy environment. The system aims to comprehensively reflect the risk factors faced by the pension financial system and provide a solid data basis for subsequent risk early warning. This paper introduces fuzzy neural network (FNN) as the core algorithm, and uses its powerful nonlinear mapping ability and fuzzy information processing ability to build a risk warning model of pension financial system. In this paper, the model is trained and verified by combining historical data with simulation data. The results show that the risk early warning model of the pension financial system based on FNN can accurately identify the potential risks in the pension financial system, and the model has better stability.",
