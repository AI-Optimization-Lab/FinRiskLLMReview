    "abstract": "The financial pre-warning is an important resource for establish financial policy. Aimed at the character of the power industry, the least squares support vector machine prediction model is given based on the principle of the statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization. The result is given that the forecasting model is effective and offers a new method to forecast the financial risk.",
