    "title": "Alike and Unlike: Resolving Class Imbalance Problem in Financial Credit Risk Assessment",
    "abstract": "Financial credit risk assessment serves as the impetus to evaluate the credit admission or potential business failure of customers in order to make early actions prior to the actual financial crisis. It aims to predict the probability that a customer may belong to a high-risk group, which is usually formulated as a binary classification problem. However, due to the lack of high-risk samples, the prevailing models suffer from the severe class-imbalance problem. Oversampling those high-risk users could alleviate this problem but the effect of noise examples is also amplified. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method to solve the class imbalance problem in financial credit risk assessment. We train a generator for synthetic sample generation with a discriminator to identify real or fake instances. Besides, an auxiliary risk discriminator is trained cooperatively with the generator to assess the credit risk. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
