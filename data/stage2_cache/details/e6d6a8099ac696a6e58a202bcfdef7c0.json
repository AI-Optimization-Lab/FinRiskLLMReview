    "title": "Blockchain system in the higher education: Storing academical students' records and achievements accumulated in the educational process",
    "abstract": "The significant interest in using of the blockchain technology in higher education for keeping secure student's records storage and retrieval is noted. This paper describes a new system based on blockchain approach to store students' records accumulated in the educational process at the higher institution in extended format. Every block of the records contains four types of information about student: academic activities, research participation, cultural activities and achievements. The system suggests participation of educational institution, student and potential employers in usage of integrated machine learning and blockchain technologies. The novelty of our paper is that the system allows university and student to keep complete and accurate data about the entire student learning process, avoid forgeries of educational records, e-portfolio inaccuracies and fabricated degrees. Additionally, it could be used by employers to find qualifying potential employees, using large amount of verified and systematically accumulated data.",
