    "title": "Is change of natural capital essential for assessing relocation policies? A case from Baihe county in western China",
    "abstract": "Whether or not reduction of natural capital should be a focus in assessing relocation policies is addressed by investigating a resettlement project for disaster prevention (also for poverty alleviation) in Baihe County in western China. Using multiple linear regression, the associations between livelihood assets (including natural capital) and the acceptance of relocation policies are examined. Two index systems are employed to measure resettlers' livelihoods and policy acceptance. Livelihood assets are shown to have a positive relationship with resettlers' acceptance of relocation policies. Of the five indicators of livelihood assets, higher physical, social, human and financial capital correlate with increased policy acceptance, while natural capital does not. This suggests that reducing or losing natural resources does not necessarily increase the risk of impoverishment in the process of resettlement. Land-based resettlement could be an option but is not indispensable for the livelihood maintenance of resettlers.",
