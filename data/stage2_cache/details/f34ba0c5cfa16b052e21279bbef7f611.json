    "title": "Risk factors for self-reported high symptom cluster burdens in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in China: A cross-sectional study",
    "abstract": "Background and Aims: Further exploration is needed to recognize symptom clusters and categorize subgroups with distinct cluster patterns and associated risks, focusing on symptoms that are highly self-reported by patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. This study aimed to identify subgroups and risk factors for self-reported high symptom cluster burden among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 647 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study, with data collected on demographics, disease information, self-reported symptoms, and psychosocial factors. Latent class analysis was utilized to identify the subgroup, while logistic regression was used to pinpoint predictive risk factors. Results: Latent class analysis revealed three subgroups: the high burden of all symptoms group (n = 107, 16.54%), the high burden of psychological symptoms group (n = 103, 15.92%), and the low burden of all symptoms group (n = 437, 67.54%). Patients in the high burden of all symptom group and high burden of psychological symptom group exhibited significantly worse function outcomes (p < 0.001). Predictive risk factors for the high burden of all symptom group included older age, lower self-efficacy, worse body image, and a higher financial burden. Similarly, patients with high burden of psychological symptom were more likely to have low self-efficacy, poor body image, and a high financial burden. Conclusio: The study demonstrated the importance of giving more attention to patients with breast cancer who are at risk of developing into membership of high symptom cluster burden group.",
