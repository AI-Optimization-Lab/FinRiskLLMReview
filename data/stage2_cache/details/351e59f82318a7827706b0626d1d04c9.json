    "abstract": "The Electric Power Enterprises arc faced with more complex risk than ever before with the introduction of competition mechanism. Then financial early-warning of Electric Power Enterprise is becoming increasingly important. Recently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an effective tool for dealing with the nonlinear problem. This paper will introduce it to the listed Electric Power Enterprise for financial early warning, proposed financial early-warning of the listed Electric Power Enterprise based on Support Vector Machine. Empirical studies show that this model can overcome many inadequacies which may appear in existed model and improve the forecast accuracy.",
