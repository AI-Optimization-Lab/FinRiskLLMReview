    "title": "Nonlinearities in the Brazilian Yield Curve",
    "abstract": "The article indicates the yield curve can be modeled using a continuous estimator as smooth transition regression, instead of traditional switch models, because bonds are traded continuously in the financial market. The results indicate that nonlinearity in the yield curve explains the pitfalls of monetary policy. The positive correlation between inflation and spread is consistent with a rise on uncertainty due to inflation risk or seems to indicate Brazilian Central Bank's monetary policy credibility in the sample period. Therefore, if dependence on international capital exists, the Brazilian economic policy makers must monitor the movements in yield and analyze its feedback frequently in order to guide their plans and decisions.",
