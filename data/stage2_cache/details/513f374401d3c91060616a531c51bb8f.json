The conclusion is as follows: In Jiangsu, the destocking of industrial enterprises has reduced the occupation of inventory fund, quickened the speed of inventory turnover and increased the economic benefits, which is 2.9 times that of reducing the occupancy of inventory fund. The external pressure index of industrial enterprises destocking has increased by 1%, and the economic benefit of the enterprise is reduced by 0.03%. This kind of painful behavior will turn to the motive force of the future development, but it is necessary to prevent the financial risk caused by the transition behavior such as low price dumping. The state should guide the healthy development of enterprises in accordance with the law of inventory cycle.",
