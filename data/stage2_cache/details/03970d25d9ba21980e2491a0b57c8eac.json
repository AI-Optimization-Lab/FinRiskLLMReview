    "title": "Patent Portfolio Analysis of the Synergy between Machine Learning and Photonics",
    "abstract": "Machine learning in photonics has potential in many industries. However, research on patent portfolios is still lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the status of machine learning in photonics technology and patent portfolios and investigate major assignees to generate a better understanding of the developmental trends of machine learning in photonics. This can provide governments and industry with a resource for planning strategic development. I used data-mining methods (correspondence analysis and K-means clustering) to explore competing technological and strategic-group relationships within the field of machine learning in photonics. The data were granted patents in the USPTO database from 2019 to 2020. The results reveal that patents were primarily in image data processing, electronic digital data processing, wireless communication networks, and healthcare informatics and diagnosis. I assessed the relative technological advantages of various assignees and propose policy recommendations for technology development.",
