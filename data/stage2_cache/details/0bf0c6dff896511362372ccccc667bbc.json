    "title": "A FUZZY LINEAR PROGRAMMING-BASED CLASSIFICATION METHOD",
    "abstract": "Multiple criteria linear programming and multiple criteria quadratic programming classification models have been applied in some field in financial risk analysis and credit risk control such as credit cardholders' behavior analysis. In this paper, a fuzzy linear programming classification method with soft constraints and criteria was proposed based on the previous findings from other researchers. In this method, the satisfied result can be obtained through selecting constraint and criteria boundary variable d(i)*, respectively. A general framework of this method is also constructed. Two real-life datasets, one from a major USA bank and the other from a database of KDD 99, are used to test the accurate rate of the proposed method. And the result shows the feasibility of this method.",
