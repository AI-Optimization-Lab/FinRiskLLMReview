    "abstract": "Cointegration is a prevalent statistical tool in applied economic in the last decade. In our proceeding we describe a very specific selection method for picking an investment set based on cointegration as a powerful technique for investigating long-term dependence in multivariate time series. We follow two stages process: at first we associate long-term, and in the second stage we use a dynamic model of correlation, called an error correction model based on linear regression analysis of returns. We considered an allocation into portfolio consisting of Dow Jones Industrial Average components and thereafter we compare long term return and risk profile of portfolio focus on cointegration selection process and index DJIA. The cointegration technique enabled us to use long calibration period and provided that portfolio weights do not change too much over time and outperform the index DJIA in post-sample performance measurement.",
