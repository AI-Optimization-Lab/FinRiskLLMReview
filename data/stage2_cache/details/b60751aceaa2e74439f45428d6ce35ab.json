    "title": "Application of Deep Q-Network in Portfolio Management",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks are widely applied to many different areas such as stock market prediction, facial recognition and automatic machine translation. This paper introduces a novel strategy based on the classic Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Deep Q-Network, for stock market portfolio management. It is a type of deep neural network which is optimized by Q Learning. To adapt the Deep Q-Network for stock market production, we first discretize the action space so that portfolio management becomes a problem that Deep Q-Network can solve. Following this, we combine the Convolutional Neural Network and dueling Q-Net to enhance the recognition ability of the algorithm. We choose five low-relevant American stocks to test our model. It is found that the Deep Q-Network based strategy outperforms the ten other traditional strategies. The profit of Deep Q-Network algorithm is 30% more than the profit of other strategies. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown demonstrates that the risk of policy associated with Deep Q-Network is the lowest.",
