    "title": "MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WITH BOOSTING REGRESSION FOR PRICING AMERICAN OPTION",
    "abstract": "The Boosting Regression Monte Carlo (BRM) method is proposed to price American options. The boosting regression is more general and flexible than the regression method in the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method and it solves the overfitting problem of the regression method in LSM through the implementation of regularization techniques, which makes the BRM method become natural improvement of the LSM approach in American option pricing. The American option pricing results are compared between BRM and LSM in two situations when the dynamics of underlying stock price of the American option follow a geometric Brownian motion and a double exponential jump diffusion process. The results show the BRM method could discover better exercise strategy in American option pricing and give more accurate American option price.",
