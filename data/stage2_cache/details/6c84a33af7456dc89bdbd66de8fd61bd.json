    "title": "Deep learning-based classification, detection, and segmentation of tomato leaf diseases: A state-of-the-art review",
    "abstract": "The early identification and treatment of tomato leaf diseases are crucial for optimizing plant productivity, efficiency and quality. Misdiagnosis by the farmers poses the risk of inadequate treatments, harming both tomato plants and agroecosystems. Precision of disease diagnosis is essential, necessitating a swift and accurate response to misdiagnosis for early identification. Tropical regions are ideal for tomato plants, but there are inherent concerns, such as weather-related problems. Plant diseases largely cause financial losses in crop production. The slow detection periods of conventional approaches are insufficient for the timely detection of tomato diseases. Deep learning has emerged as a promising avenue for early disease identification. This study comprehensively analyzed techniques for classifying and detecting tomato leaf diseases and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. The study delves into various diagnostic procedures, including image pre-processing, localization and segmentation. In conclusion, applying deep learning algorithms holds great promise for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of tomato leaf disease diagnosis by offering faster and more effective results.
