    "abstract": "With the maturity of neural network theory, it provides new ideas and methods for the prediction and analysis of stock market investment. The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of stock market investment prediction, we build neural network model and genetic algorithm model, study the law of stock market operation, and improve the effectiveness of neural network and genetic algorithm. Through the empirical research, it is found that the neural network model can make up for the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm through the optimization of genetic algorithm.",
