    "abstract": "In financial distress analysis, the diagnosis of firms at risk for bankruptcy is crucial in preparing to hedge against any financial damage the at-risk firms stand to inflict. Some pre-alarm signals that indicate a potential financial crisis exist when a firm faces a default risk. Early studies on corporate bankruptcy prediction include parametric and nonparametric approaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), for detecting pre-alarm signals. Among nonparametric techniques, the methods involving support vector machine (SVM) have shown potential in predicting corporate bankruptcy. We propose a hybrid method that combines data depths and nonlinear SVM for the prediction of corporate bankruptcy. We employed data depth functions to condense multivariate financial data with nonlinear and non-normal characteristics into one-dimensional space. The SVM method was introduced to classify the data points on a depth versus depth plot (DD-plot). Based on data set that records failed and non-failed manufacturing firms in Korea over 10 years, the empirical results demonstrated that the proposed method offers a higher level of accuracy in corporate bankruptcy prediction than existing methods. The proposed method is expected to provide a guidance in corporate investing for investors or other interested parties.",
