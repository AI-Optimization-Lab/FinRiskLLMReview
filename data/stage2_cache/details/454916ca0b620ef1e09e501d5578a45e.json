    "title": "Management of investment portfolios employing reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Investors are presented with a multitude of options and markets for pursuing higher returns, a task that often proves complex and challenging. This study examines the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in optimizing investment portfolios, comparing their performance with traditional strategies and benchmarking against American and Brazilian indices. Additionally, it was explore the impact of incorporating commodity derivatives into portfolios and the associated transaction costs. The results indicate that the inclusion of derivatives can significantly enhance portfolio performance while reducing volatility, presenting an attractive opportunity for investors. RL techniques also demonstrate superior effectiveness in portfolio optimization, resulting in an average increase of 12% in returns without a commensurate increase in risk. Consequently, this research makes a substantial contribution to the field of finance. It not only sheds light on the application of RL but also provides valuable insights for academia. Furthermore, it challenges conventional notions of market efficiency and modern portfolio theory, offering practical implications. It suggests that data -driven investment management holds the potential to enhance efficiency, mitigate conflicts of interest, and reduce biased decision -making, thereby transforming the landscape of financial investment.",
