    "title": "Analysis on risk awareness model and economic growth of finance industry",
    "abstract": "Risk management explores that financial markets are more important than the banking sector, implying substantial limitations on the capacity of strongly scaled-down financial firms such as banks to supply highly needed investment capitals. There is a growing impact of machine learning in business applications, with many solutions already established and many more being explored. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being promptly adopted for various applications in the financial services industry. In essence, risk assessment happens if an investor and financial consultant analyses try to measure possible risks in investments such as morally sterilizing, following the fund's investment goals, and taking suitable action. Hence this paper's Machine learning-based risk awareness model (ML-RAM) has been proposed to reduce the financial crisis. This paper utilizes the RAM to focus on organized financial networks through potential financial threats. Early warning metrics boost the accuracy of the traditional crisis forecast model. The empirical analysis of small and medium companies asking for credit exposes that risky and not risky borrowers can be clustered consistent with a set of similar financial features, explaining their credit scores and predicting their future behavior. The data on which a considerable rise in correlations and centrality occur show a financial risk using network analyses and machine learning algorithms. Thus, the experimental results show that the ML-RAM offers more effective analysis for the finance industry than other methods.",
