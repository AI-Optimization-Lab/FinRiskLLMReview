    "title": "Logistics Finance Collaborative Development Model Based on Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "In the context of rapid social development, a logistics financial model that can meet the financing needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and has high returns is widely used in all aspects of the logistics financial industry. Logistics finance is a new financing model that can effectively integrate logistics enterprises, financial companies, and financing institutions to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. The uncertainty of financial information, the motivation of each business service object to pursue high returns in a short period of time, and the inadequate risk preuniversal conditions have led to credit risks in the development of logistics financial services. Promoting the close integration of improved neural network algorithms based on machine learning and logistics financial financing models is inseparable from the active cooperation of all aspects, the trust of various business service objects, and the construction of logistics financial information platforms. Based on machine learning, this paper analyzes and models the collaborative development of logistics finance, analyzes the original data, and constructs sample characteristics. Due to the small amount of information in part of the sample features, this causes problems such as overfitting in the process of model building. Therefore, we designed a new feature selection based on Pearson correlation coefficient and PCA. Method. Using this algorithm for feature selection, an integrated learning method is proposed. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional neural network logistics algorithms, a neural network-based noncomplete vehicle path optimization mining model is proposed. By weighting the time domain length and spatial probability of logistics finance, the stable state of the neural network is restricted. Simulation results show that this method can effectively improve logistics efficiency and maximize the economic value of the transportation process.",
