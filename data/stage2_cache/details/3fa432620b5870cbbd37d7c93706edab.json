    "title": "Application of Supplemental Sampling and Interpretable AI in Credit Scoring for Canadian Fintechs: Methods and Case Studies",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the fintech industry has witnessed fast growth, where online or digital lending has appeared as an alternative and flexible form of financing in addition to popular forms of financing, such as term loans, and expedited the entire lending process. High-tech online platforms have provided better user experiences and attracted more consumers and SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses). Partnerships and collaborations have also been forged between financial startups and incumbents or traditional lending institutions to further differentiate products and services to niche markets and accelerate the way of innovations. With the evolving landscape of the fintech sector, risk management tools such as credit scoring have become essential to assess credit risks such as default or delinquency based on debtor credit history or status. Many fintech companies are relatively young and sometimes serve only a small portfolio with a relatively scarce delinquency history. How can they predict default risk when making financing decisions on new applications? In this paper, we document a framework of leveraging supplemental samples of consumer or business credit information from the credit bureau that can be augmented with fintech applications for credit scoring based on theoretical and empirical studies of credit application data from a Canadian online auto leasing corporation. We also provide and compare credit scoring modeling solutions utilizing interpretable AI and machine learning methods such as logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and XBGoost.",
