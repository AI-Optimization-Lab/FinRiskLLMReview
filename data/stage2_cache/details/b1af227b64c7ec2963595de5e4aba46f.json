    "title": "The Evolution of University Students' Financial Attitudes and Their Role in the Sustainability of Personal Finances",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the question of how crises influence the decision-making of Hungarian university students. Crises increase the risk of sustainability, so it is crucial to make appropriate financial decisions in such a situation. For this purpose, the authors conducted a two-stage questionnaire survey among students of economics and other majors. The inquiries took place in 2019 (n = 1558) and 2020 (n = 1712). A regression study was used to analyse the evolution of financial attitudes and investment knowledge, as well as how they are affected by a potential crisis modelled with the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been shown that interest in financial matters increases as a result of the crisis and the level of financial knowledge also increases. However, the most important conclusion of the study is that, in the event of a high threat, knowledge and practice can only be combined with calm thinking to help make appropriate financial decisions. All of this together ensures that investment decisions are the basis for the sustainability of personal finances.",
