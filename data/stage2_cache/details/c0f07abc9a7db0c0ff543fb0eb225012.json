    "title": "EFFECT OF AN E-WORKSHEET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROMOTING STUDENT ACTIVE LEARNING",
    "abstract": "Students' subjective, interactive, and deep learning (called active learning) is gaining popularity in Japan. E-portfolio system, in which all learning records are electronically collected and accumulated, is attracting attention as a means of supporting these learning processes. However, it is not always clear how to design classes using e-portfolio systems and what kind of e-portfolios should be collected and accumulated. It is also not clear how to utilize the accumulated e-portfolios in learning assessment and class improvement. This study aims to develop an e-portfolio system compatible with active learning. Specifically, we focus on an e-worksheet system which is an e-portfolio system that collects, accumulates, and manages e-portfolios using a worksheet as an interface. We implemented functions to promote active learning with e-worksheet system and tested our system to verify its effect on students. The results suggest that our system promotes students' subjective, interactive, and deep learning.",
