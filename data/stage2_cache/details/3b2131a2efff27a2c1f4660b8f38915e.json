    "abstract": "Credit risk is the uncertainty and potential for loss due to a failure to pay on the part of counterparty. Controlling against credit risk shouldn't have focused on return of the overdue accounts after the event, it should have been before the event Therefore, how to guard and control against credit risk due to credit sale improve the rate of recovery of receivable accounts, they are the real problems that enterprises have to be settled urgently. Under the background, it is necessary to study credit risk assessment and early warning with advanced technique method and mathematical theory. In this paper by Logit regression technology we construct a model for recognizing and warning credit risk based on financial and non financial ratios The tests result showed that the accuracy of the model is up to 86.6% Obversely, it can offer supports in theory to enterprises for recognizing and warning.",
