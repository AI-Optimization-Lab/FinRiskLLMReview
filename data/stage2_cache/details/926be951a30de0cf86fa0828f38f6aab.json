    "abstract": "Research background: Financial distress or non-prosperity prediction has been a widely discussed topic for several decades. Early detection of impending financial problems of the company is crucial for effective risk management and important for all entities involved in the company's business activities. In this way, it is possible to take the actions in the management of the company and eliminate possible undesirable consequences of these problems. Purpose of the article: This article aims to innovate financial distress prediction through the creation of individual models and ensembles, combining machine learning techniques such as Copyright (c) Instytut Badan Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland)",
