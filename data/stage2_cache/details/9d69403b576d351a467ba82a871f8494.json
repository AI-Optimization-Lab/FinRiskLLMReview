    "title": "Assessing cooperative and active learning in construction engineering and management technology courses",
    "abstract": "Construction is an interconnected process. The construction engineers and managers work cooperatively with many professionals and workers to implement designs. So, it is logical to teach construction students in a group environment. Also most construction students have natural talents to learn effectively in an applied atmosphere. However, assessing individual learning in a group and in the active learning mode needs special techniques. This paper illustrates some of the assessment measures used in various construction engineering and management courses at SUNY Farmingdale. It discusses individual assessment, group assessment, self assessment and peer assessment. It also elaborates on some of the main assessment tools: assessment forms, learning journals, weekly reports, peer evaluation reports, weekly quizzes, and portfolio reviews.",
