    "title": "An Investigation into the Application of the Meijering Filter for Document Recapture Detection",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of mobile devices allows financial institutions to offer remote customer services, such as remote account opening. Bad actors can easily manipulate identity document images using modern image processing software. This represents a low-cost, high-risk threat to modern financial systems, opening these institutions to fraud through crimes related to identity theft. In this paper we describe our exploratory research into the application of biomedical imaging algorithm, the Meijering filter, to the domain of document recapture detection in the mobile channel. We perform a statistical analysis to compare different types of recaptured documents and train a support vector machine classifier on the raw histogram data generated using the Meijering filter. The results show that there is potential in biomedical imaging algorithms, such as the Meijering filter, as a form of texture analysis that help identify recaptured documents.",
