    "title": "Digitalization as a double-edged sword: A deep learning analysis of risk management in Chinese banks",
    "abstract": "Digitalization presents both opportunities and formidable challenges for risk management in commercial banks. This study addresses the critical question of how digitalization influences banks' risk-taking behaviors. Applying an InstructGPT-inspired deep learning model, we developed a multidimensional bank digitalization index to analyze its effects on risk-taking, using data from 149 Chinese commercial banks from 2011 to 2020. The empirical results show that (1) digitalization significantly curtails risk-taking on the balance sheet, while concurrently escalating off-balance sheet risk exposure; (2) digitalization diminishes on-balance sheet risk by lessening distortions in competition due to government guarantees, manifested as a competition effect of onbalance sheet guarantee; (3) digitalization increases the upper limit of expected returns on bank financial products, thereby elevating off-balance sheet risk-taking, evident as an off-balance sheet price competition effect; (4) bank digitalization has a more obvious boosting effect on off-balance sheet risk-taking of banks with a longer average maturiy of wealth management products. This paper enriches the measurement of the digitalization of banks and provides a reference for banks to deepen digital applications and strengthen risk management, which has important practical significance.",
