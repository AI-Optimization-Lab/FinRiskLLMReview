    "abstract": "As the stock market has high noise, nonlinearity, uncertainty characteristics as well as traditional neural network forecasting method deficiencies of the problem, this paper presents a support vector regression (SVR) and financial time series methods to forecast future stock market; follows the value investment philosophy, reduces dimensional space by support vector machines the input vector mapped to a high dimensional space, and nonlinear problem into a linear problem, establish the value of the equity investments of prediction models under the principle of structural risk minimization. For an empirical test of the model to get the stock opened at 0.02% error of 3.66%, closing error of 0.00% to 3.41%, the results showed that SVR prediction in the stock market index has certain advantages.",
