    "title": "Performance evaluation of state-owned enterprises based on fuzzy neural network combination model",
    "abstract": "Fuzzy neural networks have seen an increasing presence in state-owned enterprise performance evaluation. Fuzzy-based financial and non-financial indicators are combined to evaluate state-owned enterprise performance. In this paper, a combination model is proposed for enterprise performance evaluation. This model is built using fuzzy neural network and uses the fuzzy method along with the neural network's self-learning ability to reduce the impact of subjective factors on the evaluation results while realizing intelligent enterprise performance evaluation. First, this paper proposes construction ideas and principles for the state-owned enterprise' performance evaluation index system and then examines its efficiency. There are two types of indicators in the system: financial and non-financial. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network is used to build a financial indicator model. The BP neural network is used to construct a non-financial indicator model for a state-owned enterprise performance evaluation portfolio model based on fuzzy neural networks. Both these networks use a decision support system during the process of building the model. Finally, a comparison is made between the results from Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network and those from the BP neural network performance evaluation model after sample data have been selected, standardization processing has been applied, and a simulation of the network model has been trained. The experiments show that the combined model can be used to evaluate the performance of state-owned enterprises which opens a new direction for evaluating enterprise performance.",
