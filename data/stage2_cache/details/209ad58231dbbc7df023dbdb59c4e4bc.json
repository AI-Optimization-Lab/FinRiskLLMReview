    "title": "Forecasting Stock Market Prices Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Systematic Review, Performance Analysis and Discussion of Implications",
    "abstract": "The financial sector has greatly impacted the monetary well-being of consumers, traders, and financial institutions. In the current era, artificial intelligence is redefining the limits of the financial markets based on state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. There is extensive use of these techniques in financial instrument price prediction, market trend analysis, establishing investment opportunities, portfolio optimization, etc. Investors and traders are using machine learning and deep learning models for forecasting financial instrument movements. With the widespread adoption of AI in finance, it is imperative to summarize the recent machine learning and deep learning models, which motivated us to present this comprehensive review of the practical applications of machine learning in the financial industry. This article examines algorithms such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, ensemble algorithms, time series analysis algorithms, and deep learning algorithms for stock price prediction and solving classification problems. The contributions of this review article are as follows: (a) it provides a description of machine learning and deep learning models used in the financial sector; (b) it provides a generic framework for stock price prediction and classification; and (c) it implements an ensemble model-Random Forest + XG-Boost + LSTM-for forecasting TAINIWALCHM and AGROPHOS stock prices and performs a comparative analysis with popular machine learning and deep learning models.",
