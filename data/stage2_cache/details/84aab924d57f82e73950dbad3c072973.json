    "title": "Financial Prediction of the Shanghai Stock Index Using Support Vector Machines",
    "abstract": "A keen interest of investors and the government is to predict the evolution of stock prices. Support vector machines (SVMs) are particularly promising methods for the prediction of financial variables because they use a risk function consisting of an empirical error and a standardized term derived from structural risk minimization. This paper applies SVM to financial forecasting and examines the feasibility of applying the methodology by comparing it with alternative forecasting methods. We conclude with remark of policy significance to the Chinese stock market and its investors.",
