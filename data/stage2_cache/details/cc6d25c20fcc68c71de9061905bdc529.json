    "title": "Older adults at risk of Covid-19 and their socioeconomic ans family vulnerabilities: an analysis with MHAS",
    "abstract": "The objective of this manuscript is to analyze the socioeconomic and family characteristics of population aged 50 years and older who are at high risk of testing positive for Covid-19, being hospitalized, or intubated in Mexico. We used two sources of information, the database of the Ministry of Health on Covid-19 and the Mexican Health and Aging Study in Mexico. We use the first to estimated regression models to calculate the risk of Covid-19, and these are applied in the second to analyze socioeconomic and family vulnerabilities. Results show that gender and age are strong predictors of high risk. Those with less schooling, those who work without a fixed physical place, those who perceive their economic situation as fair or bad, those who live in single-person households, and those who receive financial and no-financial help from their children are presented as a highly vulnerable group to Covid-19 and its repercussions.",
