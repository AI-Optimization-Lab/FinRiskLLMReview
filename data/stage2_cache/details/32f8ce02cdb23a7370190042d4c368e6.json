    "title": "ACTIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGIES IN GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS AN IN APPLIED REMOTE SENSING",
    "abstract": "This study aims to compare and evaluate the implementation of active learning methodologies in the subjects of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing Applied. For GIS, was proposed additional practical work using new information technologies (open source gvSIG). For Remote Sensing, practical work has always been proposed with the development of a portfolio and the subject is taught entirely in a computer classroom to coordinate and to time the theoretical and practical lectures. From the calculation of performance indicators (PI) and success (SI) showed that in GIS, the PI increased significantly (13%) since these changes were applied. In Remote Sensing it was observed values greater than 70% and 90% for PI and SI, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the use of active learning methodologies improve student performance.",
