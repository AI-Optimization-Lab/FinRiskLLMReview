    "title": "A Multiperiod Multiobjective Portfolio Selection Model With Fuzzy Random Returns for Large Scale Securities Data",
    "abstract": "It is agreed that portfolio selection models are of great importance for the financial market. In this article, a constrained multiperiod multiobjective portfolio model is established. This model introduces several constraints to reflect the trading restrictions and quantifies future security returns by fuzzy random variables to capture fuzzy and random uncertainties in the financial market. Meanwhile, it considers terminal wealth, conditional value at risk (CVaR), and skewness as tricriteria for decision making. Obviously, the proposed model is computationally challenging. This situation gets worse when investors are interested in a larger financial market since the data they need to analyze may constitute typical big data. Whereafter, a novel intelligent hybrid algorithm is devised to solve the presented model. In this algorithm, the uncertain objectives of the model are approximated by a simulated annealing resilient back propagation (SARPROP) neural network which is trained on the data provided by fuzzy random simulation. An improved imperialist competitive algorithm, named IFMOICA, is designed to search the solution space. The intelligent hybrid algorithm is compared with the one obtained by combining NSGA-II, SARPROP neural network, and fuzzy random simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared one not only in the running time but also in the quality of obtained Pareto frontier. To improve the computational efficiency and handle the large scale securities data, the algorithm is parallelized using MPI. The conducted experiments illustrate that the parallel algorithm is scalable and can solve the model with the size of securities more than 400 in an acceptable time.",
