    "title": "Precision Healthcare for UTIs: Leveraging Machine Learning to Reduce Readmissions",
    "abstract": "Hospital readmissions impose a significant financial strain on healthcare systems and can adversely affect patients. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study's findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.",
