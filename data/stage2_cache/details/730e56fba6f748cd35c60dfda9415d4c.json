    "abstract": "Simulation models are an indispensable tool for the successful development, testing, and sustainment of aircraft. While traditional methods of creating high quality aerodynamic models are laborious and expensive, they are used throughout aircraft sustainment to reduce test burden and mitigate operating risk. Efforts to develop and validate these flight dynamics models require large amounts of dedicated data from expensive tests. This work seeks to reduce the time and financial burdens of obtaining high-quality aircraft flight dynamics models through the use of machine learning methods in the creation of aerodynamic models.",
