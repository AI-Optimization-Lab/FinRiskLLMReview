    "title": "Empirical Test on the Relationship between Financial Region Ecological Environment and Enterprise Risk Taking Based on OLS Regression Model",
    "abstract": "To promote the risk-taking and stable development of the enterprise, the stimulus-body-reaction paradigm theory of the financial ecological environment was applied. First, according to the environment of the enterprise, the hypothesis that the financial ecological environment helped to improve the risk-taking level of the enterprise was proposed. By summarizing the enterprise risk-bearing metrics, the metrics suitable for the enterprise were selected. These specific indicators were used to evaluate the risk taking of the enterprise. The financial eco-environment measurement method was determined through the measurement of financial richness. Then, the OLS regression model was built. The research object was the shipping enterprises. Economic basic financial ecological environment dummy variables, development of financial ecological environment dummy variables, credit rating financial ecological environment dummy variables, rule of law situation financial ecological environment dummy variables were introduced. The relationship between the financial ecological environment and the risk-taking of enterprises was clarified. Finally, the OLS regression model was used to validate existing assumptions. The results showed that the good financial ecological environment significantly promoted the level of risk-taking of enterprises. Therefore, the higher the level of credit management, the stronger the role of the financial ecological environment in promoting the risk taking level of shipping companies.",
