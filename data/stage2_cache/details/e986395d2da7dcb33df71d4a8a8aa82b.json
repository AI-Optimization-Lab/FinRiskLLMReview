    "title": "Efficient option pricing via a globally regularized neural network",
    "abstract": "Nonparametric approaches of option pricing have recently emerged as alternative approaches that complement traditional parametric approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network learning algorithm for option-pricing, which is a nonparametric approach. The proposed method is devised to improve generalization and computing time. Experimental results are conducted for the KOSPI200 index daily call options and demonstrate a significant performance improvement to reduce test error compared to other existing techniques.",
