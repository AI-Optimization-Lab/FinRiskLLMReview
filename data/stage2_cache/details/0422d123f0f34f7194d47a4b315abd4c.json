    "title": "RETRACTED: Sports Enterprise Marketing and Financial Risk Management Based on Decision Tree and Data Mining (Retracted Article)",
    "abstract": "With the development of modern economy, traditional sports industry enterprises have also been further developed in the financial business. How to ensure information security and financial risk management is the problem faced by sports companies. Risk assessment is the use of mathematical models to calculate the risk factors established in the previous step to predict possible risks. In response to the above problems, we developed a sports enterprise marketing and financial risk management model based on decision trees and data mining. First, we have established a relevant evaluation index system and data samples through in-depth understanding of the actual marketing and financial problems of sports companies. Second, we use the decision tree algorithm to mine and explore related data samples and conduct risk assessment through related indicators. By using the model to calculate the probability of occurrence of the risk, analyze the degree of damage. Finally, the algorithm of this paper is analyzed and discussed through simulation experiments.",
