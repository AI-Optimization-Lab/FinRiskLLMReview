    "abstract": "Dynamics of research trends and patenting activity in a given period of time are important factors influencing the composition of the portfolio of the research projects. This article introduces the methods for identification of thematic clusters, determination of their development dynamics and prediction of the short-term trends in a specific research domain. The research on polymeric materials: composites, nanocomposites and blends has been analyzed in this paper. The presented method of structuring is based on clustering of word sets. The financial analysis techniques are applied to identification of dynamics and trend development in the analyzed field of research. The presented analyse is limited to the research papers found in Science Direct database in 1980-2010. The diversified development trends of the identified clusters have been identified e. g. strong development trend of the cluster Biomedical application, or visible decline of the cluster Structure of nanocomposites",
