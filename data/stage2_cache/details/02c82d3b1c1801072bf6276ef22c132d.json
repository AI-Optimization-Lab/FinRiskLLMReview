    "abstract": "This paper introduces the monotone extended second-order cone (MESOC), which is related to the monotone cone and the second-order cone. Some properties of the MESOC are presented and its dual cone is computed. Projecting onto the MESOC is reduced to the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) of isotonic regression. An application of MESOC to portfolio optimization is provided. Some broad descriptions of possible MESOC-regression models are also outlined.",
