    "title": "Evaluation of the content of macro and trace elements and the geographic origin of honey in North Brazil through statistical and machine learning techniques",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the content of macro and trace elements in Apis mellifera's honey in five municipalities in two regions of Par ' a in the Brazilian Amazon. This state has the largest beekeeping production chain in the Amazon, an essential source of income for family farming. We used the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry technique (ICP OES) to determine the concentration of metals (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Li, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn) in the samples. The other studied metals were detected in all five cities, except copper, found only in three locations. Three groups of elements were identified by factor analysis. The first two may indicate anthropic and geographic influences, and the third is related to the higher sodium content in mangrove honey from this ecosystem due to the influence of the maritime environment. The statistical techniques and Machine Learning proved very efficient in discriminating the origin of the honey samples. They can be used to determine geographic origin and authenticity to give subsidies to the quality control of these products, allowing the expansion and inclusion of beekeeping in the region's business portfolio.",
