    "title": "Risk of Poverty Returning to the Tibetan Area of Gansu Province in China",
    "abstract": "Based on the comprehensive analysis framework of the risk of returning to poverty, this study constructed an evaluation index system for the risk of returning to poverty to tourism villages in Tibetan areas of Gansu Province. Principal component analysis and K-means clustering algorithm were adopted to analyze the risk of returning to poverty for characteristic tourism villages in Tiantang Village, Gaxiu Village, and Cirina Village. The results show that tourism villages in Tibetan areas of Gansu are at a moderate risk of returning to poverty, but a few poverty-stricken households still face a high risk of returning to poverty; in addition, financial capital and human capital are the main components of the risk of poverty alleviation. Income level is the most important factor influencing the risk of returning to poverty. Fixed assets, skill training, distance of scenic spots, income source and housing structure also have an important impact on the risk of returning to poverty. Finally, an early warning mechanism consisting of risk assessment, determination of warning signs, identification of warning degree, warning source search, and risk prevention is necessary. To prevent the risk of tourism villages in Gansu Tibetan areas returning to poverty, it is necessary to protect livelihoods, resist the impact of risk, and improve the developmental environment.",
