    "abstract": "The construction of a scientific and effective supervision of the commercial bank accounting risk early warning model for early identification and early warning of the risk of banks, taking timely measures to prevent and resolve risks, and preventing the risk of spreading have important practical significance. A real time bank accounting supervision system model of early warning module design method is proposed based on multiple discriminant. Software development and design of early risk warning system of bank accounting supervision are analyzed. Bank accounting supervision system of real time warning module is composed by the network communication module, data acquisition module, bus transmission module and warning program loading module. The system adopts embedded design, realizes the online risk warning for bank accounting supervision through the analysis and control of user behavior, the risk early warning module software accounting supervision system with embedded Linux technology is developed, build a credit risk, interest rate risk, accounting supervision of banking risk exchange rate risk prediction and alarm multivariate discriminant analysis model, real-time early warning and information classification of bank accounting supervision system through the boot loader, to cause a bank in the business activities of various expenses and the interest payments, accounting for business payments, and regularly according to the provisions and requirements into the form of financial statements. Bank financial analysis and risk measurement is obtained. The results show that the bank accounting supervision of the system can realize the real-time risk warning, and it can improve the bank's risk prevention and management ability.",
