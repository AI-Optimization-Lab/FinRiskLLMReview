    "title": "A data science-based marketing decision support system for brand management",
    "abstract": "To improve the marketing activity and brand management and justify the most effec-tive marketing decisions, organizations should implement different information tech-nologies, mathematical methods and models into the marketing decision support sys-tem (MDSS). The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analy-sis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attract-ing new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing in-vestments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and busi-ness indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities.",
