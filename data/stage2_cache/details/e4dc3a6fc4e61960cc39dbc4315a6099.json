    "title": "An Empirical Study of Financial Pre-Warning Indicators Based on the Filter-Wrapper SVM Algorithm",
    "abstract": "In view of the weakness of traditional financial pre-warning indicators system which is established relying more on personal experience, this paper adopts a feature selection method which combined Filter with Wrapper SVM algorithm and it is used to gain a pivotal feature subset which is highly correlative with the financial risk. The result of experiments shows that the pivotal feature subset selected by this algorithm could make the classification accuracy higher. Meanwhile, the dimension of pivotal feature subset is obviously smaller than the original set.",
