    "title": "Shanghai Containerised Freight Index Forecasting Based on Deep Learning Methods: Evidence from Chinese Futures Markets",
    "abstract": "With the escalation of global trade, the Chinese commodity futures market has ascended to a pivotal role within the international shipping landscape. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI), a leading indicator of the shipping industry's health, is particularly sensitive to the vicissitudes of the Chinese commodity futures sector. Nevertheless, a significant research gap exists regarding the application of Chinese commodity futures prices as predictive tools for the SCFI. To address this gap, the present study employs a comprehensive dataset spanning daily observations from March 24, 2017, to May 27, 2022, encompassing a total of 29,308 data points. We have crafted an innovative deep learning model that synergistically combines Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The outcomes show that the CNN-LSTM model does a great job of finding the nonlinear dynamics in the SCFI dataset and accurately capturing its long-term temporal dependencies. The model can handle changes in random sample selection, data frequency, and structural shifts within the dataset. It achieved an impressive R2 of 96.6% and did better than the LSTM and CNN models that were used alone. This research underscores the predictive prowess of the Chinese futures market in influencing the Shipping Cost Index, deepening our understanding of the intricate relationship between the shipping industry and the financial sphere. Furthermore, it broadens the scope of machine learning applications in maritime transportation management, paving the way for SCFI forecasting research. The study's findings offer potent decision-support tools and risk management solutions for logistics enterprises, shipping corporations, and governmental entities.",
