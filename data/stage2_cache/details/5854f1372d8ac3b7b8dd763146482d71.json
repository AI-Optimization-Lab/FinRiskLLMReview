    "abstract": "This study explores the factors affecting citizens' willingness to pay (WTP) for e-waste management, particularly concerning data protection for laptops and PCs in Jakarta. Employing a multi-method approach that includes Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), cluster analysis, and binary logistic regression, the research identifies significant determinants shaping public attitudes and behaviors regarding e-waste management practices. A total of 567 valid samples were gathered from residents across various districts in Jakarta, ensuring diverse representation. The EFA findings highlighted three main components: passion for data protection, risk perception related to data, and access to recycling and disposal facilities, which together account for a considerable amount of variance in the data. Cluster analysis divided respondents into four distinct groups, revealing different levels of engagement with e-waste management for laptops and PCs. Furthermore, binary logistic regression indicated that a strong commitment to best data protection practices, heightened concern for data security, and improved access to recycling facilities significantly enhance WTP. In contrast, lower income, more frequent laptop/PC replacements, and younger age groups correlate with lower WTP. These results emphasize the necessity of raising public awareness, enhancing infrastructure, and implementing targeted educational and financial initiatives to foster sustainable e-waste management practices for laptops and PCs. The study's findings can guide policy and practical measures aimed at increasing public engagement and support for sustainable e-waste management in urban settings.",
