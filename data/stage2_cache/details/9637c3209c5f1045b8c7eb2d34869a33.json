    "abstract": "P2P net loan is the latest financial lending platform business, which is a new way of borrowing under the background of rapid development of the mobile Internet. Since the beginning of the new century, net loan default has caused P2P companies to break up funds and operate without continuity, which has become an important factor affecting the healthy development of the industry. Therefore, starting from the actual management situation of P2P net loan platform, the default risk of net loan was studied based on Spark technology in wireless network environment. The decision tree data mining algorithm was introduced to construct the early warning model of the net loan default risk, which achieved effective control of risk links. From the fuzzy characteristics that affected the uncertain factors of net loan credit, a hybrid algorithm model of C4.5 decision tree optimization was established. The simulation results show that the hybrid optimization model has good application value.",
