    "abstract": "This paper investigates failures of p2p loans on US marketplace Lending Club. The aim of this paper is to quantify significant variables which can be used to predict loan status. This study analyses approximately 260000 completed loans from years 2007-2015. Because of dichotomous depended data, logistic regression was chosen to interpret data. Findings show that almost all studied variables have significant impact on loan status. In this dataset, variable term has the greatest impact from continuous variables, where loans with longer duration have higher chances not to be repaid. Significant influence was recorded in categorical variables purpose and home ownership. Using these findings, it is possible to create portfolio with lower risk profile and higher profits than using traditional financial options.",
