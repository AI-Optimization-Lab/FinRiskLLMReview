    "title": "Role of Financial and Valuation Indicators in Increasing Attractiveness of Investment Projects Implemented by Private Equity Funds",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to justify the directions of further development of criteria for financial and investment attractiveness of projects. As the main objective of the study, the authors analyse an ability of private equity funds to increase the attractiveness of investment projects through the analysis of dynamics of various financial and valuation indicators. The research method is regression modelling. The sample includes mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, and restructuring carried out by private equity funds. As a starting point of the study, the authors suggest several hypotheses: (i) the key metric for evaluation investment attractiveness of a project is a set of financial and valuation indicators, (ii) investment attractiveness of a project is determined by increasing value of acquired companies during the implementation of an investment project, (iii) EV/EBITDA valuation multiple and operating efficiency expressed as EBITDA margin are appropriate indicators for evaluation of investment attractiveness of projects implemented by private equity funds. As a result, the authors conclude that analysis of financial and valuation indicators enables exploring new mechanisms of increasing investment attractiveness of projects and that private equity funds are able to increase attractiveness of investment projects and hence receive abnormal gain on invested capital by enhancing operating efficiency of the portfolio company.",
