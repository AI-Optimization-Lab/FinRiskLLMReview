    "title": "A Hybrid Multi-objective Programming based System Portfolio Selection by SoSCR",
    "abstract": "With military requirements, practitioners often face weapon system portfolio selection problems at the equipment R&D stage. Recently, the system of SoS contribution rate (SoSCR) always serves as one of the critical criteria to evaluate the role of a system, facilitating with the weapon system portfolio selection. In this paper, we establish a SoSCR value evaluation model considering two aspects of static capability contribution rate and dynamic connectivity contribution rate, which provide a more comprehensive estimate. Then, based on the value evaluation model, the classification optimization selection strategy is used to obtain the optimal system portfolio. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.",
