    "abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation of the financial system risk quantitatively and a management information system designed to improve financial risk management. Based on the recognition of risk sources for all kinds of financial institutions and financial markets, we use a matrix covering financial risk probability and related damage to assess local risks and carry out risk classification, and use self-organizing mapping neural network model to evaluate the overall risks. Also, by means of radio frequency identification technology and big data analytics platform-Hadoop platform, a management information system is built which could perform three core functions: real-time monitor, analysis and evaluation, and automatic control, which would help regulators to realize the whole process and comprehensive intelligent management for financial risk sources.",
