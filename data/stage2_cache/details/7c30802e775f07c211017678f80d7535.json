    "title": "APPLICATION OF MARKOV CHAINS IN FACTORING",
    "abstract": "Factoring is a financial transaction whereby a business sells its receivables to a third party (a factor) before their maturity day. In fact, it represents a specific mode of crediting which is mostly preferred by small and medium enterprises. There are several forms of factoring practically used. Differentiation is done depending on scale of property and transfer of risk to the factor. The aim of our paper is to describe theoretical background and practical usage of mathematical model of interest rate estimation (factoring with regression) and risk margin estimation (factoring without regression) by using Markov chains.",
