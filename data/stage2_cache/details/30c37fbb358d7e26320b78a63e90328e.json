    "title": "Reinforcement Learning-Based Multimodal Model for the Stock Investment Portfolio Management Task",
    "abstract": "Machine learning has been applied by more and more scholars in the field of quantitative investment, but traditional machine learning methods cannot provide high returns and strong stability at the same time. In this paper, a multimodal model based on reinforcement learning (RL) is constructed for the stock investment portfolio management task. Most of the previous methods based on RL have chosen the value-based RL methods. Policy gradient-based RL methods have been proven to be superior to value-based RL methods by a growing number of research. Commonly used policy gradient-based reinforcement learning methods are DDPG, TD3, SAC, and PPO. We conducted comparative experiments to select the most suitable method for the dataset in this paper. The final choice was DDPG. Furthermore, there will rarely be a way to refine the raw data before training the agent. The stock market has a large amount of data, and the data are complex. If the raw stock market data are fed directly to the agent, the agent cannot learn the information in the data efficiently and quickly. We use state representation learning (SRL) to process the raw stock data and then feed the processed data to the agent. It is not enough to train the agent using only stock data; we also added comment text data and image data. The comment text data comes from investors' comments on stock bars. Image data are derived from pictures that can represent the overall direction of the market. We conducted experiments on three datasets and compared our proposed model with 11 other methods. We set up three evaluation indicators in the paper. Taken together, our proposed model works best.",
