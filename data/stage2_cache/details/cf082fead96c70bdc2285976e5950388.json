    "abstract": "This paper has suggested a blockchain-based intelligent Risk Management Decision support system (BC-IRMDSS) with a fuzzy neural network (FNN) for a supply chain finance-based evaluation of the credit risk of funding small and medium-sized enterprises. The BC-IRMDSS uses a decision tree algorithm to make online financial institutions' credit reports more transparent. An essay describing the use of blockchain technology to build a supply chain finance system that uses blocks to store financial data from the supply chain. An FNN is used to process finance data and conduct risk assessments to address and improve the degree of risk management in the supply chain.",
