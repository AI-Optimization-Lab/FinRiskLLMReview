    "title": "Risk Prediction for Internet Financial Enterprises by Deep Learning Algorithm and Sustainable Development of Business Transformation",
    "abstract": "It is necessary to find new ideas of business transformation of traditional financial enterprises under the background of internet finance. Based on DL (deep learning) algorithm, the BPNN (back propagation neural network) model and vector autoregression model are used to analyze the business conflict of commercial banks among traditional financial enterprises under internet finance. The business integration point of the two is found through the impulse response analysis of the impact of the internet financial business on the traditional financial industry. Then, the DL algorithm based on BPNN is used to obtain the optimal solution of business integration, to promote the transformation of traditional financial services under the background of internet finance. The results show that there is a close correlation between internet finance and traditional financial business. The initial conflicts between the two are serious, but as time passes, they have a trend of mutual integration.",
