    "title": "RETRACTED: Research on personal credit evaluation of internet finance based on blockchain and decision tree algorithm (Retracted article. See vol. 2023, 2023)",
    "abstract": "With the development of Internet finance, existing financial platforms have gradually formed a large-scale, dynamic operating environment. How to ensure information security and realize personal credit evaluation is an urgent problem to be solved in the development of Internet financial platforms. The rise of blockchain technology has provided new solutions for the management of Internet financial platforms and information security. In view of the shortcomings of the current Internet financial credit evaluation, this article discusses the key standards of personal credit evaluation. With the help of blockchain, decision tree, and other technologies, this paper designs the credit evaluation process and establishes personal credit evaluation technology. Experiments and analyses show that this technology can effectively improve the transparency of personal credit information in Internet finance. This technology is used to study credit risk assessment factors and provide new solutions for the intelligent transformation and upgrading of Internet finance.",
