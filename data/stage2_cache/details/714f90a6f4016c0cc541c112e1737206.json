    "title": "INFLUENCE OF COVID-19 RELATED MEDIA AND NEWS ON THE STOCK AND CRYPTO MARKETS",
    "abstract": "The entire world was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandem- ic, leading to confusion and turbulence in healthcare systems, as well as to extreme uncertainty in the financial realm. There was a profound distress in stock markets due to the enormously elevated levels of risk instigated by the pandemic, which additionally inflated investors' losses. The contagion was supplemented by a surge of false stories that appear to be news (fake news) that circulated throughout all media channels, thus additionally am- plifying uncertainty. This paper expands the previous literature by investi- gating media impact on prominent indices of the stock and cryptocurrency markets. RavenPack Panic and Fake News indices were utilized to exam- ine their influence on S&P 500 and crypto (Royalton CRIX) indices' daily movements by employing OLS and quantile regression. The results exhibit that there are noteworthy dependencies over the conditional distribution, but they present only a small influence on observed indices. Fake news influ- ences the cryptocurrencies' daily movements in a bearish market, however the effect is very weak. Furthermore, media -induced panic is significant in both exceptionally bearish and bullish conditions considering S&P 500 daily returns, but is also exhibiting low impact.",
