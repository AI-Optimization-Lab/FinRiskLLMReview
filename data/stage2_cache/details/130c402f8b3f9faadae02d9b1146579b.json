    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application status of deep learning (DL) in enterprise management, with China Merchants Bank as an example, and the role of DL in bank enterprise management. We analysed the application status of AI in marketing, risk control, investment, and other fields of CMB and identified five types of problems encountered in the current practical application of AI. We proposed five countermeasures: strengthening the AI organisation system's construction, enhancing the financial data guarantee mechanism, concentrating on customer-oriented, tightly managing the danger of AI technology, and building a full AI talent system. Recent data are used to assess the impact of DL in marketing, risk management, and investment consulting. According to the data, by the end of 2019, the number of clients of CMB's two APP platforms had reached 114 million and 91.2643 million, respectively. In 2019, CMB's personal savings balance climbed by roughly 53% compared to 2016, and its personal loan amount increased by approximately 61%. These findings indicate that the use of AI improves consumer happiness and trust in businesses.",
