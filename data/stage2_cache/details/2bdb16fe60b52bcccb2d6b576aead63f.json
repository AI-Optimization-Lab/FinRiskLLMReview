    "title": "Improvements on the Disease Migration Model",
    "abstract": "The number of aging populations and chronic disease patients has increased continuously in China. The increasing trend leads to public health problems and heavy financial burden in the society. To counter these problems, an early intervention approach is needed. Disease Migration Model (DMM) takes the subject's current health status and medical historical data as input and predicts future disease migration. DMM, as a prediction model, could be useful in disease early treatment. In this study, we propose an integrated DMM system based on XGBoost machine learning algorithm. With health screening data and living habits as input, our DMM model could predict future disease risk. Besides, we implement a feature selection module and data imputation module to improve system performance and robustness. In a preliminary test, we show that the above improvements can increase the hypertension prediction accuracy to 85%.",
