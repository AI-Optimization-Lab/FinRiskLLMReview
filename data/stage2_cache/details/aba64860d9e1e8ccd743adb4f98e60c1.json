    "title": "Instant Clue: A Software Suite for Interactive Data Visualization and Analysis",
    "abstract": "The development of modern high-throughput instrumentation and improved core facility infrastructures leads to an accumulation of large amounts of scientific data. However, for a majority of scientists the comprehensive analysis and visualization of their data goes beyond their expertise. To reduce this hurdle, we developed a software suite called Instant Clue that helps scientists to visually analyze data and to gain insights into biological processes from their high-dimensional dataset. Instant Clue combines the power of visual and statistical analytics using a straight forward drag & drop approach making the software highly intuitive. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for systematic analysis such as dimensional reduction, (un)-supervised learning, clustering, multi-block (omics) integration and curve fitting. Charts can be combined with high flexibility into a main figure template for direct usage in scientific publications. Even though Instant Clue was developed with the omics-sciences in mind, users can analyze any kind of data from low to high dimensional data sets. The open-source software is available for Windows and Mac OS (http://www.instantclue.uni-koeln.de) and is accompanied by a detailed video tutorial series.",
