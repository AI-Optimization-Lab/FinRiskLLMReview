    "title": "Financial risk analysis of real estate bubble based on machine learning and factor analysis model",
    "abstract": "The regional real estate price bubble regulation policy is an external factor for the real estate industry. The effect of real estate regulation is difficult to determine, which is a typical problem of uncertain system analysis and forecasting, and the gray Bayesian network forecasting model is to solve the forecasting problem of economic system subject to external regulation. Based on machine learning and factor analysis models, this paper constructs a real estate bubble financial risk analysis model based on machine learning and factor analysis models. Moreover, starting from the real estate price bubble, which is a hot and difficult issue of the social economy, this paper discusses the causes of the formation of real estate price bubbles and the mechanism of the formation of real estate price bubbles, looks for the importance of policy regulation of real estate price bubbles, and clarifies the functional game model of policy regulation of real estate price bubbles. In addition, this paper uses examples to study the model constructed in this paper. The results show that the model constructed in this paper has a certain effect.",
