    "abstract": "The debt default risk of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) has become a potential trigger for systemic financial risks. How to effectively prevent hidden debt risk has always been a hot issue in public-private partnership (PPP) financing management research. In recent years, machine learning has become more and more popular in the study of enterprise credit evaluation. However, most scholars only focus on the output of the model, and do not explain in detail the extent to which variables affect the model and the decision-making process of the model. In this paper, we aim to apply a better credit rating method to the key factors and analysis of LGFV's default risk, and analyze the decision-making process of the model in a visual form. Firstly, this paper analyzes the financial data of LGFVs. Secondly, the XGBoost-logistic combination algorithm is introduced to integrate the typical characteristics of PPP projects and construct the credit evaluation model of LGFVs. Finally, we verify the feasibility of the model by K-fold cross validation and performance evaluation. The results show that: (1) net worth, total assets, operating income, and return on equity are the most critical factors affecting the credit risk of LGFVs, asset-liability ratio and tax revenue are also potentially important factors; (2) the XGBoost-logistic model can identify the key factors affecting the credit risk of LGFVs, and has better classification performance and predictive ability. (3) The influence of each characteristic variable on model decision can be quantified by the SHAP value, and the classification decision visualization of the model improves the interpretability of the model.",
