    "title": "Application of Grey Theory and Neural Network in Medium Term Wind Power Forecasting",
    "abstract": "In order to study wind power medium term forecast method, a combined forecasting method is proposed in this paper, taking gray theory and neural network to combine to forecast wind power of wind farm. Through establishing metabolism gray forecast model, using the linear weighted method to take gray information metabolism model and chaotic neural network model for portfolio optimization, and simulated the waveform of combination forecasting model, two kinds of conventional single forecast model and the real value, concluded: combination forecasting model can effectively improve the medium-term wind power forecasting accuracy, stability is very excellent.",
