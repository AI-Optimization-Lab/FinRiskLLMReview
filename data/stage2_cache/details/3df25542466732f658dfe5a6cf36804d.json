    "abstract": "As global financial markets continue to evolve and change, financial risk monitoring and early warning have become increasingly important. However, the complexity and diversity of financial markets have led to the emergence of multidimensional and multimodal data. Traditional risk monitoring methods face difficulties in handling such diverse data and adapting to the monitoring and early warning needs of emerging risk types. To address these issues, this article proposes a financial risk intelligent monitoring and early warning model that integrates deep learning to better cope with uncertainty and risk in the financial market. Firstly, the authors introduce an LSTM model in the initial approach, trained on historical financial market data, to capture long-term dependencies and trends in the data, enabling effective monitoring of financial risk. They also optimize the model architecture to improve its performance and prediction accuracy. Secondly, the authors further introduce a transformer model with self -attention mechanism to better handle sequential data.",
