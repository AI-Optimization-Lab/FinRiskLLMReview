    "title": "Constructing an anticipation formula for fire loss in factory-type",
    "abstract": "The before fire assessment data from the ARC fire risk assessment system and the financial loss from post-fire damage report for factory-type buildings located in Taiwan were collected. The correlation between assessment data and degree of fire loss (DFL) was calculated by three regression analyses - linear, power, and exponential equations - to produce an anticipation formula. The results revealed that there is more a believable prediction when the fire loss is bigger, regardless of the amount of fire loss or the DFL, while the latter is more related to the assessment grade. By providing proprietors and insurance companies detailed fire risk analysis showing predictable financial loss, it is advantageous for budget management and fire protection, enforcement and should result in the reduction of fire risk and subsequent damage to factory-type buildings.",
