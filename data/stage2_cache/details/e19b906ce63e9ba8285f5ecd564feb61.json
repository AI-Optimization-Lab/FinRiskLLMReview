    "title": "The Effects of Risk Preference and Corporate Governance on the Islamic Banks' Efficiency Using Stochastic Frontier Approach",
    "abstract": "This research investigated the effects of risk preferences and good corporate governance on cost efficiency of Islamic Banks. This paper examined the Islamic Banks listed on the Indonesia Financial Service Authority during the period of 2010-2014. The cost efficiency score was measured using Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) and the hypotheses were tested using regression method. The results showed that the solvency and liquidity have positive effects on the efficiency of the Islamic Banks. However, financing quality, good corporate governance (GCG) have no significant effect on the cost efficiency of the Islamic Banks. The results indicate that banks' management reacts positively to the risk to maintain the ability to meet all its obligations by improving the efficiency.",
