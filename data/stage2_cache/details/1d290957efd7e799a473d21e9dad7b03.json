    "title": "A forecast model based on RBF neural network for local financial revenue",
    "abstract": "The revenue forecast of local financial is critically important since agency budgets, debt evaluation and risk warning all depend on their accuracy. This paper present a nonlinear model based on RBF neural network. There are some ameliorated measures in leaning algorithm of RBF neural network. The number and the centric value of hidden layer are determined by using immune algorithm. The supervisory algorithm is taken as method of adjustable weight of output layer. Using above measures, the network is optimized, and the forecast model obtains the precise and objective solution.",
