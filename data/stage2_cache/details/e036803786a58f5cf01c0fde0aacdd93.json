    "abstract": "This paper mainly analyzed stock price prediction and portfolio optimization strategy based on regression analysis. It is studied based on fuzzy decision theory with proportional to the cost of trading of securities portfolio optimization problem. First of all, based on absolute deviation risk function and minimax principle this paper proposes a new risk function to minimax the half absolute deviation risk function; Then, we introduced a kind of nonlinear membership function more vividly describes the investors' investment income and satisfaction with the degree of the investment risk. On this basis, we further put forward the fuzzy decision satisfaction with nonlinear portfolio selection model. In the final part, we numerically simulate the proposed methodology, the result proves the feasibility.",
