    "abstract": "Credit risk management is one of the most important issues in financial research. Reliable credit scoring models are crucial for financial agencies to evaluate credit applications. In this article, a novel feature-weighted support vector machine credit scoring models are presented for credit risk assessment, in which F-score and improved F-score is adopted for feature importance calculating. These feature-weighted versions of Support Vector Machine are tested against the traditional feature selection Support Vector Machine on two real-world datasets and the research results reveal the validity of the proposed method. The feature-weighted methods have optimized performance, which improved the accuracy and reduced the modeling time consumption.",
