    "title": "Deep Learning in Finance: A Survey of Applications and Techniques",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has transformed the financial industry by enabling advanced applications such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and market forecasting. At the core of this transformation is deep learning (DL), a subset of ML that is robust in processing and analyzing complex and large datasets. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of key deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL). Beyond summarizing their mathematical foundations and learning processes, this study offers new insights into how these models are applied in real-world financial contexts, highlighting their specific advantages and limitations in tasks such as algorithmic trading, risk management, and portfolio optimization. It also examines recent advances and emerging trends in the financial industry alongside critical challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and computational complexity. These insights can guide future research directions toward developing more efficient, robust, and explainable financial models that address the evolving needs of the financial sector.",
