    "title": "Prediction of business failure by total margin support vector machines",
    "abstract": "The analysis and management of business failure has been recognized to be important in the area of financial management in the evaluation of firms' performance and the assessment of their viability. To this end, effective failure-prediction models are needed. This paper describes a new approach to prediction of business failure using the total margin algorithm which is a kind of support vector machine. It will be shown that the proposed method can evaluate the risk of failure better than existing methods through some real data.",
