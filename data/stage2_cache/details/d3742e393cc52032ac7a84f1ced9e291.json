    "title": "Time-varying regression model with unknown time-volatility for nonstationary signal analysis",
    "abstract": "The problem of estimating time-varying regression is studied via a mathematical formulation of a class of nonstationary signal analysis problems. This problem inevitably concerns the necessity to choose the appropriate level of model volatility - ranging from the full stationarity of instant regression models to their absolute independence of each other. A modification of the Kalman-Bucy filter and smoother is considered to allow for easy computing of the leave-one-out error of the signal model as a quality indicator of each specific volatility level. On the basis of the proposed technique we develop a new approach to the problem of detecting the hidden dynamics of an investment portfolio in respect to certain market or economic factors.",
