    "title": "The Relationship between Individual investor Supervisory Sentiment and Default Risk of Listed Real Estate Enterprises: A Study Based on Text Big Data and Machine Learning Methods",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the frequent occurrence of real estate default incidents has become a focal point for risk prevention and mitigation efforts. Previous research has predominantly focused on the roles of institutions and media, overlooking the influence of individual investors. This study leverages textual big data from investor interaction platforms and employs a bi-LSTM model to extract sentiment and supervisory information, thereby constructing an index for individual investor sentiment monitoring. We analyze its impact on the default risk of real estate firms. Based on the results of a dual-machine learning model, we find that individual investor supervisory sentiment contributes to reducing the default risk of listed real estate firms. Moreover, it can alleviate financing constraints for these firms, thus further mitigating default risk. Additionally, individual investor monitoring complements government regulation. This discovery offers a novel perspective for financial regulation and provides evidence of the role of micro-level forces in financial oversight.",
