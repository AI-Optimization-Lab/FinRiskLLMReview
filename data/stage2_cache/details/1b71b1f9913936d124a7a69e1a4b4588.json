    "title": "AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATION IN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to supplement and even substitute for practically all tasks currently performed by humans. Under the drive of external forces and technological advances, AI is used in various domains. Among these, AI applications in finance is facing a promising future. This paper reviews AI applications in different areas, especially in financial industry and points out the core techniques and specific scenes. This paper also take the AI application in portfolio management as an example, construct a portfolio based on spectral clustering (SC) connected to stock complex network. The portfolio constructed by AI techniques in this example proves to outperformance its traditional counterparts.",
