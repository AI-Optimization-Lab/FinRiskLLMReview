    "abstract": "This paper has carried on the tentative discussion to the early warning model for risk management under the separation of the sectors of investment bank, have analysed the characteristic of the investment bank at first, then discern the risk of the investment bank to classify, propose the index system of early warning model, introduce propagating against error neural network of neural network theory, and utilize this network to build early warning model and realize the corresponding algorithm by the tool MATLAB. The theory and realistic meaning of this paper is to promote the development of investment bank theory of our country, opening up the research range of the financial theory, especially there are important theory meaning and applying value to the setting-up of the early warning system of risk of the securities business.",
