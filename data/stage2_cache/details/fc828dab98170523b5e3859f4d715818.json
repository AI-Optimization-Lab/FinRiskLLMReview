    "title": "Exploration on Portfolio Selection and Risk Prediction in Financial Markets Based on SVM Algorithm",
    "abstract": "In order to cope with the complex risk environment of the current financial market, achieve portfolio optimization and accurate risk prediction, this paper conducts effective research using SVM algorithm. This article uses stock data as a sample to empirically analyze the risk return and risk prediction performance of investment portfolio strategies based on SVM algorithm. Compared with traditional index fund investment strategies, the risk resistance of investment portfolio strategies is significantly improved, and the risk return is also stable at a high level. In addition, with the support of SVM algorithm, the risk prediction error level in the financial market remains within a relatively low range. From the perspective of practical applications, the financial market investment portfolio selection and risk prediction based on SVM algorithm has strong feasibility.",
