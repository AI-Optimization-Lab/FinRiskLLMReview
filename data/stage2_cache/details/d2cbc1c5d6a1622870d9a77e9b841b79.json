    "title": "Using the Six Sigma Methodology to Reduce Missed Appointments at a Pediatric Inner-City Clinic",
    "abstract": "Pediatric missed appointments impact patient outcomes and the financial well-being of clinics. Our purpose was to implement the Six Sigma methodology at a pediatric clinic to (1) identify significant predictor factors of missed appointments and develop a prediction model and (2) implement interventions to reduce the missed appointment rate. Binary logistic regression identified historical no-show rate, high-risk visit types, lack of insurance, the number of provider visits, and appointment lead time as significant predictor factors. Interventions led to a significant drop in the missed appointment rate and the no-show rate.",
