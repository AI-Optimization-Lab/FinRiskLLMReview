    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the issues of decision making under uncertainty with particular reference to research and development (R and D). We briefly outline some of the techniques, which have been discussed in the literature, and we consider two, which have been reported as being useful in practice. The first of these, the decision tree approach, has been around for a long time whereas the second, Option Pricing Theory, has only become of interest in the last decade. We report the outcomes of an examination of alternative techniques for assessing projects in the portfolio of the UK chemicals division of a diversified multinational company. Under the conditions of limited data availability commonly found in companies, Option Pricing Theory was found to be a useful aid in assessment of projects in the division's portfolio when combined with a Monte Carlo method and decision trees. Not surprisingly, we conclude that more attention needs to be paid to documentation of projects and that data availability is a significant issue which needs to be addressed.
