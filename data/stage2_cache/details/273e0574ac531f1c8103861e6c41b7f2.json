    "title": "The diversification benefits of cryptocurrency factor portfolios: Are they there?",
    "abstract": "We investigate the out-of-sample diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies from a generalised perspective, a cryptocurrency-factor level, with traditional and machine-learning-enhanced asset allocation strategies. The cryptocurrency factor portfolios are formed in an analogous way to equity anomalies by using more than 2000 cryptocurrencies. The findings indicate that a stock-bond portfolio incorporating size- and momentum-based cryptocurrency factors can achieve statistically significant out-of-sample diversification benefits for investors with different risk preferences. Additionally, machine-learning-enhanced asset allocation strategies can boost the traditional approaches by enriching (shrinking) the distributions of weights allocated to potentially effective cryptocurrency factors. Our findings are robust to (i) the inclusion of transaction costs, (ii) an alternative benchmark portfolio, and (iii) a rolling-window estimation scheme.",
