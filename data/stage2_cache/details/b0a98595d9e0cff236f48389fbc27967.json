    "abstract": "This paper presents a big data analysis and prediction system based on convolutional neural networks. Continuous template matching technology is used to analyze the distributed data structure of big data, and the information fusion processing of cloud service combination big data is combined with matching related detection methods, frequent item detection, and association rule feature extraction of high-dimensional fusion data. A clustering method is adopted to realize the classification and mining of cloud service portfolio big data. The hardware equipment of the car to detect the surrounding environment is complicated, and the combination of the convolutional neural network and the camera to detect the surrounding environment has become a research hotspot. However, simply using the convolutional neural network to process the camera data to control the turning angle of the car has the problems of long training time and low accuracy. An improved convolutional neural network is proposed. The experimental results show that the accuracy of data mining by this method is 12.43% and 21.76% higher than that of traditional methods, and the number of iteration steps is shorter, indicating that the timeliness of mining is higher. This network structure can effectively improve the training speed of the network and improve the accuracy of the network. It is proven that the convolutional neural network has faster training speed and higher accuracy.",
