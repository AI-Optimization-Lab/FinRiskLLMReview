    "title": "An Adoptive Miner-Misuse Based Online Anomaly Detection Approach in the Power System: An Optimum Reinforcement Learning Method",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the Bitcoin-based financial trading system (BFTS) has created new challenges for the power system due to the high-risk consumption of mining devices. Briefly, such a problem would be a compelling incentive for cyber-attackers who intend to inflict significant infections on a power system. Simply put, an effort to phony up the consumption data of mining devices results in the furtherance of messing up the optimal energy management within the power system. Hence, this paper introduces a new cyber-attack named miner-misuse for power systems equipped by transaction tech. To overwhelm this dispute, this article also addresses an online coefficient anomaly detection approach with reliance on the reinforcement learning (RL) concept for the power system. On account of not being sufficiently aware of the system, we fulfilled the Observable Markov Decision Process (OMDP) idea in the RL mechanism in order to barricade the miner attack. The proposed method would be enhanced in an optimal and punctual way if the setting parameters were properly established in the learning procedure. So to speak, a hybrid mechanism of the optimization approach and learning structure will not only guarantee catching in the best and most far-sighted solution but also become the high converging time. To this end, this paper proposes an Intelligent Priority Selection (IPS) algorithm merging with the suggested RL method to become more punctual and optimum in the way of detecting miner attacks. Additionally, to conjure up the proposed detection approach's effectiveness, mathematical modeling of the energy consumption of the mining devices based on the hashing rate within BFTS is provided. The uncertain fluctuation related to the needed energy of miners makes energy management unpredictable and needs to be dealt with. Hence, the unscented transformation (UT) method can obtain a high chance of precisely modeling the uncertain parameters within the system. All in all, the F-score value and successful probability of attack inferred from results revealed that the proposed anomaly detection method has the ability to identify the miner attacks as real-time-short as possible compared to other approaches.",
