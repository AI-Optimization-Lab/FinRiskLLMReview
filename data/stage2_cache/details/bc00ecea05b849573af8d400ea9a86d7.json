    "title": "Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Delayed Control and Deep Learning Resolution",
    "abstract": "We consider a simple class of stochastic control problems with a delayed control, in both the drift and the diffusion part of the state stochastic differential equation. We provide a new characterization of the solution in terms of a set of Riccati partial differential equations. Existence and uniqueness of a solution are obtained under a sufficient condition expressed directly as a relation between the time horizon, the drift, the volatility and the delay. Furthermore, a deep learning scheme (The code is available in a IPython notebook.) is designed and used to illustrate the effect of the delay feature on the Markowitz portfolio allocation problem with execution delay.",
