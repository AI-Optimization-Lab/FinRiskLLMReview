    "title": "FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT IN AN INNER-CITY POPULATION - THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS",
    "abstract": "A case-control study of low birthweight among residents of high risk areas of Alameda County was conducted in 1983. The relation of 13 variables to low birthweight was assessed using a multiple logistic regression analysis. A six-fold increase in the risk of low birthweight was found in association with financial problems during the current pregnancy, controlling for differences in race, certain poor health habits, complications of pregnancy, and several other factors between cases and controls.",
