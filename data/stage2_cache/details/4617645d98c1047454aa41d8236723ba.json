    "title": "A constrained cluster-based approach for tracking the S&P 500 index",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of tracking a benchmark target portfolio of financial securities in particular the S&P 500. Linear integer programming models are developed that seeks to track a target portfolio using a strict subset of securities from the benchmark portfolio. The models represent a clustering approach to select securities and also include additional constraints that aim to control risk and transactions costs. Lagrangian and semi-Lagrangian methods are developed to compute solutions to the tracking models. The computational results show the effectiveness of the linear tracking models and the computational methods in tracking the S&P 500. Overall, the models and methods presented can serve as the basis of the optimization module in an optimization-based decision support for creating tracking portfolios.",
