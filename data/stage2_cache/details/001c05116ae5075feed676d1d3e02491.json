    "title": "An equity-implied rating model forunrated firms",
    "abstract": "While investors and lenders rely on one or more external credit rating agencies(eg, EthiFinance, Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch Ratings) to directly assesstheir obligors' credit quality, or simply to benchmark their own estimates, part oftheir portfolio might not be covered by these credit assessment institutions. Con-sequently, some practitioners estimate obligors' probability of default using mod-els derived from Merton's classic 1974 model and then translate them into market-implied ratings. These measures are highly volatile and sensitive to overall marketmovement; that is, probabilities of default are high in a bear market and low ina bull market, whereas an obligor's actual credit quality might stay relatively sta-ble. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on Merton's distance todefault. We compute the distance to default from market data and transform it into adistance-to-default-based rating for each firm listed on the stock market. Further, weuse a machine learning algorithm to link the firm's distance to default and sector toits credit rating. Ultimately, this approach allows us to assign a distance-to-default-based rating to unrated firms. To show the relevance of this method, we compare theexplanatory power of the model's equity-implied ratings with those of actual credit ratings in relation to the interest/debt ratio, and we find similar results (ie, a coef-ficient of determination of 87% in both cases). This demonstrates that our modelexplains the interest rates paid as well as the credit ratings",
