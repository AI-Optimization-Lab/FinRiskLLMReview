    "title": "Maximising investors' wealth in the cryptocurrency market: a behavioural perspective",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to investigate investors' prospects in adding value to their portfolios by considering investors' behavioural score (Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) score) and a clustering technique in the selection of assets. The universe of assets constitutes 63 cryptocurrencies sourced from Bloomberg from Jan 01, 2020, to July 31, 2022. The study period was segmented into two distinct and mutually exclusive periods, namely COVID-19, and post-COVID-19. Nine portfolios were constructed of which six were based on the CPT and the remaining on the K means Clustering technique. Using the copula-based Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for the optimisation, the results show that portfolios consisting of assets with extremely high CPT scores were preferred during the post-COVID-19 and full sample periods, except for portfolios comprising assets with extremely low CPT scores during the COVID-19 period. The most optimised portfolio was composed of classified assets with extremely high CPT scores in the post-COVID-19 period. These findings provide intuitive and coherent investment strategies to guide investors in the cryptocurrency market.",
