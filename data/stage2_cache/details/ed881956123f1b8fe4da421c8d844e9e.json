    "title": "Application of data clustering and machine learning in variable annuity valuation",
    "abstract": "The valuation of variable annuity guarantees has been studied extensively in the past four decades. However, almost all the studies focus on the valuation of guarantees embedded in a single variable annuity contract. How to efficiently price the guarantees for a large portfolio of variable annuity contracts has not received enough attention. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel method based on data clustering and machine learning to price the guarantees for a large portfolio of variable annuity contracts. Our test results show that this method performs very well in terms of accuracy and speed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
