    "abstract": "Advertisements play a crucial role in the mass spreading and success of a product, a service or an entire business. For gaining effectiveness, they should be judged thoroughly by means of direct and indirect rating, portfolio tests, transactions and interactions. Instead of those, human emotions can be a powerful source of reliable feedback. This information is valuable for company to not only re-evaluate the efficiency of their ads but also make them more interactive to customers. To build a good facial expression recognition program, deep learning is applied in the form of Convolutional Neural Network, increasing the accuracy of classifying 7 basic emotions to 90% on CK+ dataset. Moreover, we have designed 2 systems, one for storing and updating the commercials and one for extracting emotion data and attracting customers.",
