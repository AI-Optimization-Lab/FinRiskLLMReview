    "title": "Research on the Implementation of Financial Risk Control Models and Algorithms Based on Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, machine learning has been rapidly applied to the financial services industry. With the applications of machine learning, it will bring challenges to the stable development of the financial industry. This paper studies the user behavior analysis algorithm based on operator big data, and provides financial risk control mechanism for financial enterprises. Taking finance as the data collection object, in the user behavior prediction algorithm, the experiment uses the spectral clustering algorithm to cluster the non-convex data samples, and converts the samples to the Laplacian feature space. It not only reduces the dimension, but also clusters the data, and obtains the global optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is analyzed experimentally, and the tool prototype is realized. The developed gadgets have also been applied in enterprises. The research provides a method for the construction of a risk control model in the financial industry, thereby helping financial enterprises to better control the risk of lending. This paper also provides reference for the performance improvement of the model.",
