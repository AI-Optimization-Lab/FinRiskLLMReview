    "title": "Deep xVA Solver: A Neural Network--Based Counterparty Credit Risk Management Framework",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel computational framework for portfolio-wide risk management prob-lems, where the presence of a potentially large number of risk factors makes traditional numerical techniques ineffective. The new method utilizes a coupled system of BSDEs for the valuation ad-justments (xVA) and solves these by a recursive application of a neural network--based BSDE solver. This not only makes the computation of xVA for high-dimensional problems feasible, but also pro-duces hedge ratios and dynamic risk measures for xVA, and allows simulations of the collateral account.",
