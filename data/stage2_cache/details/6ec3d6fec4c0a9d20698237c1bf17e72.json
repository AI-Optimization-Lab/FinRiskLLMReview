    "abstract": "This paper investigates the motives of FX-risk management based on the changes of forward open positions of Hungarian corporations. We have found that Hungarian companies are significantly more exposed in short EUR forward position, than in EUR long one. Our linear regression model also showed that changing market conditions have an essentially higher impact on the EUR short positions. Our results confirmed that expectations are determining in the risk hedging decisions proving that financial risk management also has a speculative motive.",
