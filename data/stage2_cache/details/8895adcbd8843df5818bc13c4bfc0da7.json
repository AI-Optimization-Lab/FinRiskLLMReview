    "abstract": "This paper deals with models of artificial neural networks applied in financial management. Artificial neural networks as a machine learning technique are a modern part of quantitative prediction models which are one of the most used approaches in finance for making right decisions. There is a hypothesis that advanced neural networks which are able to learn and then predict the future state can also be helpful for managers in decision making process. Therefore, authors create apply these models in financial risk management to test this hypothesis. Study shows that neural networks combined with genetic algorithm provide more accurate prediction than standard network and therefore can be helpful in management by eliminating the risk of making the bad decision in decision-making process performed regularly in every company.",
