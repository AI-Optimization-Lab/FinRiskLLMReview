    "title": "How ChatGPT will [insert hyperbolic cliche here] the [insert industry here]: Creating media literacy infographics about generative AI",
    "abstract": "This activity prompts students to go beyond the often reductionist responses to new technologies (e.g. technological determinism) by creating a media literacy-focused infographic about the role, uses, ethical concerns, and/or impact of generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT). Sample topics have included the role of AI in specific industries (e.g. film, advertising, accounting, etc.) and media studies topics (e.g. online dating, celebrities, sports, communicating with the dead, etc.). The activity includes five one-week segments that culminate with a poster presentation session for the campus community. Successful completion of the assignment also provided students with a tangible portfolio item. Courses This activity was developed for an introductory course in media studies. It could be modified for any course level and applied to a variety of relevant courses in communication, and media studies, among others. Objectives After the completion of this unit, students will have gained: (1) an understanding of the approaches to new technologies (e.g. technological determinism) and critical media literacy as guiding theoretical frameworks; (2) the ability to apply these frameworks to new media innovations and specific industries; (3) improved research, synthesis, and application skills; and (4) improved skills in strategic communication, message design, and public speaking.",
