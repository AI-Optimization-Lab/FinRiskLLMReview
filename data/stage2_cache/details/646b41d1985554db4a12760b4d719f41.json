    "title": "Logistics Financial Risk Assessment Based on Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Network",
    "abstract": "This article mainly introduces a set of perfect logistics financial evaluation system through particle swarm optimization and neural network, so as to avoid the internal and external various kinds of logistics enterprises in the process of logistics and financial services. Through the application of particle swarm optimization and neural network theory to establish the logistics financial risk evaluation model, using the structure form and training principle of BP particle swarm optimization and neural network, the survey data is the sample, and the network is fully trained and tested, thus the accurate risk assessment can be made to the logistics financial risk.",
