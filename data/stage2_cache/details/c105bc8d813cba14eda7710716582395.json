    "title": "Operations Research Enables Auction to Repurpose Television Spectrum for Next-Generation Wireless Technologies",
    "abstract": "In 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission completed the world's first two-sided spectrum auction, reclaiming radio frequency spectrum from television broadcasters to meet exploding demand for mobile broadband, 5G, and other wireless services. Operations research-including a customized series of optimization models, decompositions, cuts, heuristics, large neighborhood searches, and a portfolio of propositional satisfiability solvers whose parameters were determined by machine learning- was essential to the design and implementation of the auction. The auction repurposed 84 megahertz of spectrum and generated gross revenue of nearly $20 billion, providing more than $10 billion in capital for the broadcast television industry and over $7 billion for federal deficit reduction.",
