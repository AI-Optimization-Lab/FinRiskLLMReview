    "title": "Data ming-based financial fraud detection: Current status and key issues",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in information, detection, data mining, risk and security technologies have given rise to a new era of research, known as data mining based financial fraud detection (FFD). Several data mining algorithms including regression, neural network, decision tree, Bayesian and Stacking variant methodology, incorporating financial ratio and learning mechanisms, have been developed that allow one to extract relevant knowledge from large amount of data like fraudulent financial statements (FFS). FFD is a new attempt; thus, several research questions have often being asked. For instance: (1) how to finish the detection process for these algorithms? (2) how to understand and classify these algorithms in terms of fraud detecting? (3) will they require specific data? (4) what kind of detection approach are used? (5) which one is the most popular method in use? To help answer these questions, we conduct an extensive review on literature. We present a generic FFD framework and a classification scheme to guide the review process. Frequencies of different techniques/algorithms used are tableau and analyzed. Finally, we share directions for future research.",
