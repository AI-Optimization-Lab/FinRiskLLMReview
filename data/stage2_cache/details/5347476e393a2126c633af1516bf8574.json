    "title": "Semiring programming: A semantic framework for generalized sum product problems",
    "abstract": "To solve hard problems, AI relies on a variety of disciplines such as logic, probabilistic reasoning, machine learning and mathematical programming. Although it is widely accepted that solving real-world problems requires an integration amongst these, contemporary representation methodologies offer little support for this. In an attempt to alleviate this situation, we position and motivate a new declarative programming framework in this paper. We focus on the semantical foundations in service of providing abstractions of well-known problems such as SAT, Bayesian inference, generative models, learning and convex optimization. Programs are understood in terms of first-order logic structures with semiring labels, which allows us to freely combine and integrate problems from different AI disciplines and represent non-standard problems over unbounded domains. Thus, the main thrust of this paper is to view such well-known problems through a unified lens in the hope that appropriate solver strategies (exact, approximate, portfolio or hybrid) may emerge that tackle real-world problems in a principled way.
