    "title": "Fuzzy C-means clustering for the optimal portfolio of machinery industrial sustainable development strategies in Taiwan",
    "abstract": "Many products of machinery industry that produced in Taiwan ranked within top-ten exports Countries around the world. However, with the dynamic change in both the internal and external environment, production volume, imports and exports dropped simultaneously in 2001. In order to strengthen the industry's competitive advantage, we propose ten Sustainable strategies for machinery industry through focus opinions and employ fuzzy hierarchical analysis approach to find the order these strategies. Furthermore, we introduce fuzzy c-means Clustering to determine the optimal combination of these strategies for sustainable development. Finally, three clusters be extracted for enhancing the industrial promotion, improving national competitiveness and sustainable development, Through this research, we successfully demonstrate that fuzzy C-means clustering not only provides good discriminating power in pattern recognition, but also contribute to good portfolio selection for industry.",
