    "title": "Customer Portfolio Management in Indian Banks: Current Practices and Future Scope",
    "abstract": "Although profitable customer portfolios can be a huge asset for any firm, yet this area is still highly under-researched and is considered to be simply an off-shoot of customer relationship management, which is not true. It builds upon the concept of relationships to include only the truly profitable ones. A number of theories have been proposed for customer portfolio management, which have evolved from being static in nature, to the highly dynamic ones which make use of advanced tools like Data Mining, Regression Trees etc. and are based on the fact that customer relationships undergo changes with time instead of remaining the same. This paper seeks to review and then use the previous research carried out in this aspect of marketing to determine the extent to which customer portfolio management techniques have found their way into the Banking Industry in India along with the scope for further penetration of these techniques into this Industry.",
