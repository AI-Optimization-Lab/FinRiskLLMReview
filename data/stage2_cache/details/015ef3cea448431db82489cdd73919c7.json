    "title": "Risk Management of Supply Chain Green Finance Based on Sustainable Ecological Environment",
    "abstract": "Green supply chain finance is a new financing method that focuses on corporate restructuring and promotes corporate capital flow and the development of environmental protection. This paper used BP neural network technology to study the green financing of the supply chain under the sustainable ecological environment. The method played an important role in the trial. Due to the more uncertain factors faced and the more complex environment, the risks of green supply chain finance are more hidden, diverse, and complex. The BP neural network is relatively mature in both network theory and performance. Its outstanding advantages are its strong nonlinear mapping ability and flexible network structure. The positive effect of BP neural network on green financial risk management is verified by experiments. Green supply chain finance is an innovative model of green finance. This experiment studies the risk management of green finance in supply chain and the evaluation index of green finance risk management through BP neural network method, and shows that the evaluation results are highly scientific. In addition, based on the green supply chain model, the historical data of different regions provide a scientific basis for the sustainable ecological development of the region. This paper provides guidance for the sustainable development of green finance in the supply chain and makes contributions to promoting the development of green economy. In order to control the risks of supply chain financing business, the risks of supply chain financing business are classified and analyzed, and specific project risk levels and points are determined to propose control measures to ensure effective control of the business risks.",
