    "abstract": "In the new era, with the rapid entry of a large number of financial products into the market environment, network finance has become an indispensable part of people's daily life. From the practical point of view, the network loan has the advantages of simple operation and a short audit cycle, so it has attracted the attention of the public once it is promoted. However, due to the influence of the environment and their own technology, it is easy to appear the risk of fraud during the operation. In the face of this development phenomenon, it is very important for the future development of the internet finance industry to construct a financial risk control model based on the credit evaluation of loan applicants. Based on the understanding of the risk control model in an unbalanced data environment, this paper constructs the design and implementation of the financial risk control model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), and analyzes and discusses the final results.",
