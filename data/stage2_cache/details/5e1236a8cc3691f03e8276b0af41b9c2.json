The methods which we usually use has the ARCH and GARCH models and random fluctuation model in this paper. We used Huaxia bank's securities data to compare the GARCH model and Quantile regression model. And we have got the Quantile regression which is based on semiparameters estimate method can make more accurate measurements for the risk of financial markets make more accurate measurements.",
