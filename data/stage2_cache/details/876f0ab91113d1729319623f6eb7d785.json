    "title": "An Adaptive Master-Slave Regularized Model for Unexpected Revenue Prediction Enhanced with Alternative Data",
    "abstract": "Revenue prediction is an essential component in security analysis since the revenue of a company has a great impact on the performance of its stock. For investment, one of the most valuable pieces of information is the company's unexpected revenue, which is the difference between the officially reported revenue and the consensus estimate for revenue predicted by analysts. Since it is the unexpected revenue that indicates something exceeding or under analysts' expectation, it is an indispensable factor that influences the performance of a stock. Besides conventional trading data from stock market and companies' financial reports, recent years have witnessed an extensive application of alternative data for gaining an information edge in stock investment. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of better predicting unexpected revenue of a company via machine learning with alternative data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying this problem in literature. However, it is nontrivial to quantitatively model the relations between the unexpected revenue and the information provided by alternative data with a machine learning approach. Thus we proposed an adaptive master-slave regularized model, called AMS for short, to effectively leverage alternative data for unexpected revenue prediction. AMS first trains a master model upon a company graph, which captures the relations among companies, using a graph neural network (GNN). Then for a target company, the master model generates an adaptive slave-model, which is specially optimized for this target company. Finally, we use this slave-model to predict the unexpected revenue of the target company. Besides its excellent prediction performance, another critical advantage of our AMS model lies in its superior interpretability, which is crucial for portfolio managers to understand the predicted results. With extensive experiments using two real-world alternative datasets, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model against a set of competitors.",
