    "title": "Haunted by nonprofits: Five themed mini-teaching cases for Halloween and Dios de los Muertos",
    "abstract": "Halloween provides an opportunity to teach public administration and nonprofit management concepts in a fun way, which increases student retention and understanding. Teaching cases are an evidence-based pedagogical tool that facilitates active learning and brings together perspective-taking, critical thinking, and problem-solving. This article presents five themed mini-teaching cases perfect for Halloween that can be taught individually or together: emotional labor in dark tourism; risk management for nefarious volunteers; cemetery management; financial management through zombie philanthropy; and nonprofit demise. The lessons integrate real-world scenarios with public administration concepts in a timely, fun, and evidence-based delivery method. Each case includes a scholarly interpretation through a public administration or nonprofit management lens, learning objectives, discussion and test questions, and reading and viewing recommendations. These five lessons provide a wide-reaching, foundational application for any public administration and nonprofit management classroom.",
