    "title": "Comparison of the credit scoring models on PD estimation of US banks",
    "abstract": "The paper is devoted to the estimation of the probability of default (PD) as a crucial parameter in risk management, rating estimation, pricing of credit derivatives and many others key financial fields. Particularly, in this paper we will estimate the PD of US banks by means of the statistical models, generally known as credit scoring models. First, in theoretical part, we will briefly introduce the two main categories of credit scoring models, which will be afterwards used in application part - linear discriminant analysis and regression models (linear regression, logit and probit). In the main part of the paper we will work with the sample of almost three hundreds of commercial US banks which will be separate into the groups of defaulted and non-defaulted banks on the basis of historical information. Subsequently, we will stepwise apply the mentioned above scoring models on this sample to derive several models for estimation of PD. Further we will discuss the drawbacks and advantages of the particular models and compare reached results.",
