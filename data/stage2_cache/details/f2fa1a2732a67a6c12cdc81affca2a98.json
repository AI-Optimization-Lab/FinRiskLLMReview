    "title": "Exploration of Financial Market Credit Scoring and Risk Management and Prediction Using Deep Learning and Bionic Algorithm",
    "abstract": "The purpose is to effectively manage the financial market, comprehensively assess personal credit, and reduce the risk of financial enterprises. Given the systemic risk problem caused by the lack of credit scoring in the existing financial market, a credit scoring model is put forward based on the deep learning network. The proposed model uses RNN (recurrent neural network) and BRNN (bidirectional recurrent neural network) to avoid the limitations of shallow models. Afterward, to optimize path analysis, bionic optimization algorithms are introduced, and an integrated deep learning model is proposed. Finally, a financial credit risk management system using the integrated deep learning model is proposed. The probability of default or overdue customers is predicted through verification on three real credit data sets, thus realizing the credit risk management for credit customers.",
