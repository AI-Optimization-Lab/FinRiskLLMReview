    "title": "MAS-DR: An ML-Based Aggregation and Segmentation Framework for Residential Consumption Users to Assist DR Programs",
    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of energy grids, driven by rising demand and unpredictable residential consumption, highlights the need for efficient demand response (DR) strategies and data-driven services. This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for DR that clusters users based on their consumption patterns and categorizes individual usage into distinct profiles using K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering, and DBSCAN. Key features such as statistical, temporal, and behavioral characteristics are extracted, and the novel Household Daily Load (HDL) approach is used to identify residential consumption groups. The framework also includes context analysis to detect daily variations and peak usage periods for individual users. High-impact users, identified by anomalies such as frequent consumption spikes or grid instability risks using IsolationForest and kNN, are flagged. Additionally, a classification service integrates new users into the segmented portfolio. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in helping energy managers design tailored DR programs.",
