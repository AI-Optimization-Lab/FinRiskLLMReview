    "title": "The Evaluation Study of Supply Chain Financial Risk Based on the BP Neural Network",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the supply chain financial has become the focus of attention of the many financial institutions, because the supply chain financing model is to make full use of the supply chain and the characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprise designed. It is not only the effective way of small and medium-sized enterprises in China to solve the difficulty of financing, but also is an effective way of the Commercial Banks expand financial services [1]. This paper firstly constructed the financial credit risk evaluation index system of small and medium-sized enterprise based on supply chain, through the BP neural network model analyze credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprise, then predicted their financing credit level, to provide the basis for Commercial Banks for credit.",
