    "title": "Solving the Fraud Detection Problem",
    "abstract": "For all financial institutions providing retail credit loans, underwriting processes and scoring models play the key role in the risk management. However, especially for very big portfolios of clients, also the fraud management and post-approval portfolio monitoring becomes essential. Since the fraud patterns are often complicated, the analyses become multi-variate and the number of hypotheses grows exponentially. Also the number of observations in each segment decreases and the rate of frauds gets statistically insignificant. This paper deals with two principle problems in fraud detection - identifying the segments with high default concentrations and finding these segments in a big data sample. For the purpose of the identification, several methods are suggested and the proposed expert binomial test is concluded to be the most relevant for this task. Then for finding the segments the GUHA method is discussed and compared with the classification tree method on a real set of data from the financial market. In this comparison the GUHA method brings more comprehensive results containing all possible predictor combinations, whereas the classification tree method was quicker and covered the most relevant distinct segments.",
