    "title": "Construction of a new tool for predicting cancer-specific survival in papillary thyroid cancer patients who have not received surgery",
    "abstract": "Background The prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer is gradually increasing and the trend of youthfulness is obvious. Some patients may not be able to undergo surgery, which is the mainstay of treatment, due to physical or financial reasons. Therefore, the prediction of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with non-operated papillary thyroid cancer is necessary.Methods Patients' demographic and clinical information was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. SPSS software was used to perform Cox regression analyses as well as propensity score matching analyses. R software was used to construct and validate the nomogram. X-tile software was used to select the best cutoff point for patient risk stratification.Results A total of 1319 patients were included in this retrospective study. After Cox regression analysis, age, grade, T stage, M stage, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were used to construct the nomogram. C-index, calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristic curves all verified the high predictive accuracy of the nomogram. The decision curve analysis demonstrated that patients could gain clinical benefit from this predictive model. Survival curve analysis after propensity score matching demonstrated the positive effects of radiotherapy on CSS in non-operated patients.Conclusion Our retrospective study successfully established a nomogram that accurately predicts CSS in patients with non-operated papillary thyroid cancer and demonstrated that radiotherapy for operated patients can still help improve prognosis. These findings can help clinicians make better choices.",
