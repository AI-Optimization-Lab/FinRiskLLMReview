    "abstract": "This paper reports the findings from regression models that were developed to predict financial risk tolerance using demographic and socioeconomic factors. Using a sample of white-collar clerical workers (N = 220), it was determined that financial knowledge, income, education, ethnic background, financial solvency, number of dependents, and homeownership can be used to predict a person's financial risk tolerance.",
