    "abstract": "This study analyzed Sports Science Degree university students' perceptions about the use of debates and e-portfolio as student-centered learning strategies. The study involved 426 students from the third and last year of the program (23% females; mean age = 20.6 +/- 1.1). A questionnaire was used to collect data, and thematic analysis revealed four positive (active learning, information exchange, innovation, and skills development) and three negative (ignorance of methodology, lack of interest/distraction, and extra work) themes related to these strategies. Despite some negative perceptions, students highlighted the positive aspects of these methods, indicating that incorporating them can improve learning outcomes.",
