    "title": "A Research on the Financial Distress Model for Listed Tourism Companies based on Adaboost-BPNN",
    "abstract": "Since the 2007 financial crisis, many crises took huge impacts on the operation of tourism enterprises and seriously affected the development of the Chinese tourism industry. Financial crisis warning is an effective way to find a company's potential business risk and financial risk. Because of small sample size of listed tourism companies and low classification precision of BP neural network, Adaboost algorithm was proposed to enhance BPNN precision. In this paper, the author built a financial distress model for listed tourism companies based on Adaboost-BPNN. By selecting listed tourism firms from Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share stock market, the empirical research verified the validity of the new model.",
