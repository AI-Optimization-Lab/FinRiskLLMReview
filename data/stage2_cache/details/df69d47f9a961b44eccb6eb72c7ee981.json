    "abstract": "Small and medium-sized enterprises play a very important role in China's economic and social development. Their development is inseparable from the financial support, and the development of credit business is also an important aspect of bank's operation. At the time of solving the problem of financing difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises, how to manage credit risk will become an important subject to study. In this paper, we choose 50 money-borrowing enterprises' financial data in a commercial bank as samples to construct logistic risk assessment model. We make regression analysis, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Hosmer-Lemeshow randomness test. The empirical results show that the logistic risk assessment model has good fitness of the data.",
