    "title": "PCA-SVM-based evaluation for Investment Value on Electric Power Listed Firms",
    "abstract": "First the evaluation indexes system of the investment value on electric power listed firms is established from the view of investors. Then the principal components analysis is used to filtrate the indexes in order to avoid the overlap among the information. Many indexes are turned to a few comprehensive indexes which influence the Investment Value on Electric Power Listed Firms. The comprehensive indexes are irrelevant with each other but hold the main information of the original variable. Then SVM model is used to test and evaluate the samples. The analysis indicates that the model could appraise the investment value on electric power listed firms effectively and thoroughly. And the final results and evaluation model could be regarded as the foundation for investors to select and construct their investment portfolio.",
