    "title": "How Many Stocks Are Sufficient for Equity Portfolio Diversification? A Review of the Literature",
    "abstract": "Using extensive and comprehensive databases to select a subset of research papers, we aim to critically analyze previous empirical studies to identify certain patterns in determining the optimal number of stocks in well-diversified portfolios in different markets, and to compare how the optimal number of stocks has changed over different periods and how it has been affected by market turmoil such as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main methods used are bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Evaluating the number of assets which lead to optimal diversification is not an easy task as it is impacted by a huge number of different factors: the way systematic risk is measured, the investment universe (size, asset classes and features of the asset classes), the investor's characteristics, the change over time of the asset features, the model adopted to measure diversification (i.e., equally weighted versus optimal allocation), the frequency of the data that is being used, together with the time horizon, conditions in the market that the study refers to, etc. Our paper provides additional support for the fact that (1) a generalized optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist for whichever market, period or investor. Recent studies further suggest that (2) the size of a well-diversified portfolio is larger today than in the past, (3) this number is lower in emerging markets compared to developed financial markets, (4) the higher the stock correlations with the market, the lower the number of stocks required for a well-diversified portfolio for individual investors, and (5) machine learning methods could potentially improve the investment decision process. Our results could be helpful to private and institutional investors in constructing and managing their portfolios and provide a framework for future research.",
