    "title": "Research of bad debt risk assessment in enterprise based on multi-layer SVM classifier",
    "abstract": "With the development of market economy, the problem of bad debt becomes increasingly important in enterprises. In this paper, a bad-debt-risk evaluation model is established based on multi-layer SVM classifier, using a new set of index system which combines financial factors with non-financial factors on the basis of the 5C system evaluation method. The bad debt rating is separated into four classes- normality, attention, doubt and loss through analyzing accounts payable. Then the multi-layer SVM classifier is trained with 180 samples which are stochastically extracted from listed companies, and the four classes are identified by the trained classifier using 65 samples. The test results show that the classifier has an excellent performance on training accuracy and reliability. Finally, BP neural network is also used to assess the same data. The experiment results show that multi-layer SVM classifier is effective in credit risk assessment and achieves better performance than RP neural network.",
