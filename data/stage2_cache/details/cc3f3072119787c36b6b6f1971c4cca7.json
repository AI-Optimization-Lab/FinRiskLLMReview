    "title": "Device-Free People Counting in IoT Environments: New Insights, Results, and Open Challenges",
    "abstract": "In the last years multiple Internet of Things (IoT) solutions have been developed to detect, track, count, and identify human activity from people that do not carry any device nor participate actively in the detection process. When WiFi radio receivers are employed as sensors for device-free human activity recognition, channel quality measurements are preprocessed in order to extract predictive features toward performing the desired activity recognition via machine learning (ML) models. Despite the variety of predictors in the literature, there is no universally outperforming set of features for all scenarios and applications. However, certain feature combinations could achieve a better average detection performance compared to the use of a thorough feature portfolio. Such predictors are often obtained by feature engineering and selection techniques applied before the learning process. This manuscript elaborates on the feature engineering and selection methodology for counting device-free people by solely resorting to the fluctuation and variation of WiFi signals exchanged by IoT devices. We comprehensively review the feature engineering and ML models employed in the literature from a critical perspective, identifying trends, research niches, and open challenges. Furthermore, we present and provide the community with a new open database with WiFi measurements in several indoor environments (i.e., rooms, corridors, and stairs) where up to five people can be detected. This dataset is used to exhaustively assess the performance of different ML models with and without feature selection, from which insightful conclusions are drawn regarding the predictive potential of different predictors across scenarios of diverse characteristics.",
