    "title": "Applying Machine Learning to Healthcare Operations Management: CNN-Based Model for Malaria Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore how machine learning technologies can improve healthcare operations management. A machine learning-based model to solve a specific medical problem is developed to achieve this research purpose. Specifically, this study presents an AI solution for malaria infection diagnosis by applying the CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithm. Based on malaria microscopy image data from the NIH National Library of Medicine, a total of 24,958 images were used for deep learning training, and 2600 images were selected for final testing of the proposed diagnostic architecture. The empirical results indicate that the CNN diagnostic model correctly classified most malaria-infected and non-infected cases with minimal misclassification, with performance metrics of precision (0.97), recall (0.99), and f1-score (0.98) for uninfected cells, and precision (0.99), recall (0.97), and f1-score (0.98) for parasite cells. The CNN diagnostic solution rapidly processed a large number of cases with a high reliable accuracy of 97.81%. The performance of this CNN model was further validated through the k-fold cross-validation test. These results suggest the advantage of machine learning-based diagnostic methods over conventional manual diagnostic methods in improving healthcare operational capabilities in terms of diagnostic quality, processing costs, lead time, and productivity. In addition, a machine learning diagnosis system is more likely to enhance the financial profitability of healthcare operations by reducing the risk of unnecessary medical disputes related to diagnostic errors. As an extension for future research, propositions with a research framework are presented to examine the impacts of machine learning on healthcare operations management for safety and quality of life in global communities.",
