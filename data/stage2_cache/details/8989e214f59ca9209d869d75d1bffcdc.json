    "title": "Simulation/Regression Pricing Schemes for CVA Computations on CDO Tranches",
    "abstract": "We devise simulation/regression numerical schemes for pricing the CVA on CDO tranches, where CVA stands for Credit Valuation Adjustment, or price correction accounting for the defaultability of a counterparty in an OTC derivatives transaction. This is done in the setup of a continuous-time Markov chain model of default times, in which dependence between credit names is represented by the possibility of simultaneous defaults. The main idea of this article is to perform the nonlinear regressions which are used for computing conditional expectations, in the time variable for a given state of the model, rather than in the space variables at a given time in diffusive setups. This idea is formalized as a lemma which is valid in any continuous-time Markov chain model. It is then implemented on the targeted application of CVA computations on CDO tranches.",
