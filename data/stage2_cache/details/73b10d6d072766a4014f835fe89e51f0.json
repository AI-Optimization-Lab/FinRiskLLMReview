    "title": "Weather Derivative Design and Valuation in Agriculture",
    "abstract": "Risks in agriculture can be generally grouped into three categories - normal, marketable and catastrophic. The paper deals with weather derivatives as the potentially new tools for management of systematic risk in agriculture (especially drought). Weather derivative represent an innovative financial risk management tool related to the conduct of the weather. The aim of the paper is to point out some problems of index estimation for the purposes of weather derivative valuation considering the particularities of agriculture. Assessment of the sensitivity of barley to weather over 40 years has been the basis for the design and valuation of weather derivative in the Czech Republic (The South Moravian Region). The analysis is based on linear regression modeling using monthly temperature index (as the most suitable independent weather variable) and barley yield (as dependent variable). The burn analysis based on parametric bootstrap is used as the method for the valuation of weather derivative contract, namely the call option. It can be concluded that the burn analysis is suitable for weather derivative valuation in agriculture, but only if the basis risk has been minimized. With the effective bootstrap tool, the burn analysis may easily be processed and the uncertainty about the pay-off and other statistics can be effectively determined. Nevertheless, the results of the analysis reveal a significant adverse impact of basis risk on the quality of agricultural weather derivative in the Czech growing conditions. The article outlines the scope for use of weather derivative as the reinsurance tool in regions with frequent occurrence of systematic weather risk.",
