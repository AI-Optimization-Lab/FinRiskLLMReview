    "abstract": "The construction of an effective and practical financial risk forecasting model is the increasingly urgent need of the stakeholders. Aiming at the issue of fuzzy neural network learning algorithm being prone to getting the local extreme value, this paper introduces the ant algorithm and establishes an improved identifying financial forecasting model based on fuzzy artificial neural network. The article chooses 170 listed companies' financial ratios as a sample, studying the improved identifying financial forecasting model based on fuzzy artificial neural network, and the empirical result shows that the forecast accuracy of the improved program has improved greatly.",
