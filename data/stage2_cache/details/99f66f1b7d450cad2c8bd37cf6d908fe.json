    "title": "Learning from the Past: The Impacts of Economic Crises on Energy Poverty Mortality and Rural Vulnerability",
    "abstract": "The summer-dominated Mediterranean island of Cyprus is often considered in the contexts of beach tourism, sunny weather, and different types of business economic activities and services. In terms of its climatic conditions, extreme heat and mild winters characterise the island; yet, recent evidence has shown that winter poses a significant threat to public health. Its excess winter mortality is amongst the highest in Europe and there is an increased risk of energy-poverty-related mortality compared to total mortality. This study is an extension of previous research, with the objective of further scrutinizing the shift observed between urban and rural energy poverty mortality in the time of a severe nationwide financial crisis. Mortality and temperature data for the period of 2008-2018, as well as macroeconomic indicators, were investigated through a linear regression analysis. The results indicated that the declining economic situation of the island severely hit rural areas, with a significant increase in energy-poverty-related mortality, while urban areas were more resilient to this. There are three existing challenges linked to energy poverty: low incomes, high energy prices, and poor building energy efficiency. In Cyprus, all three coincide and are aggravated in times of crisis, creating conditions of extreme vulnerability for populations already in a disadvantaged position. This study's motivation was to highlight the intense vulnerability associated with crises in Cyprus, and its outcomes call for higher levels of support at such times, especially when it comes to rural populations.",
