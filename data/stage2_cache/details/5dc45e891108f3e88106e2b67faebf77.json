    "title": "Design and Application of Intelligent Financial Accounting Model Based on Knowledge Graph",
    "abstract": "With the continuous progress of science and technology, economic globalization has become an important direction for the development of enterprises. In the process of enterprise development, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have greatly improved the efficiency of enterprise accounting and financial management and have gradually shifted traditional financial accounting to modern financial management and accounting. Owing to the existing problems of inefficiency, large consumption of time and resources, and low degree of intelligence in the existing computerized financial data prediction systems, this study proposes an intelligent financial accounting and a financial risk monitoring and early warning model based on knowledge graph and deep learning techniques. To validate its performance, the model is trained using financial data of 120 listed companies, and the model is applied to establish the prediction of whether the listed companies are facing a financial crisis, using another 60 companies as the test sample. Results show that the use of deep learning and knowledge graph techniques can significantly improve the regulatory model, enhance regulatory penetration, and alleviate regulatory time lag, thus improving the ability of regulation to detect enterprise problems and prevent risks.",
