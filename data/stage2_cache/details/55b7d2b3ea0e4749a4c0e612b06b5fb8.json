    "title": "Securing Financial Network System through Multilevel Security Using Cyber-Physical System and Data Mining Concepts",
    "abstract": "The main scope of this research paper is to build a security system with multilevel security features of the financial network system. It explores to extract the customer behavior in the financial sector through data mining concepts like clusters. The primary it is to cluster the customer behavior into various patterns and examine the correlation among this cluster for fraud detection and risk management. The secondary task is to classify the data into multilevel and secure through the Cyber Physical System (CPS). Through the CPS, the proposed system is to implement and monitor the entire network and also to ensure the information classification.",
