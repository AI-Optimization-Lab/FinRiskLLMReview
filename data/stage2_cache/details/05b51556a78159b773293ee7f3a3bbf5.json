    "title": "A Model for Clustering and Optimizing Portfolio: Tehran Stock Exchange using data mining algorithms",
    "abstract": "Management of investment basket and selecting assets is one of the problems of decision making in financial area. In the competitive business environment, in order to confront complex competitions in the market, financial institutes try to consider the best policy of investment basket that in turn leads to an increase in the output for the investors. The goal of this study is to develop a portfolio by considering the behavior of investors in risk taking in a realistic method.
