    "title": "Credit Card Fraud Detection Using K-Means Combined with Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed incredible growth in the credit card ecosystem, changing the dynamics of payment mechanisms. Credit cards provide ease of use and security to the customers, but there are various challenges in the domain. Recently, the surge in fraudulent cases involving credit cards has led to an increased risk of online transactions. Various financial institutions and researchers are trying to mitigate this problem by detecting fraudulent transactions. Therefore, we propose a novel approach by combining clustering and classification algorithms to identify credit card fraudulent transactions with high performance. The proposed system uses K-Means algorithms for clustering followed by different classification algorithms to construct the state-of-the-art credit-card fraud detection system. The proposed system based on random forest achieved the highest precision of 99.94%, recall 99.94%, F1-score 99.93%, and accuracy 99.9%.",
