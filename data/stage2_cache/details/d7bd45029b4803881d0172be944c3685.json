    "title": "Application of Artificial Neural Network in Corporate Financial Risk Early-Warning",
    "abstract": "The traditional financial risk warning model are all based on probability theory and statistical analysis, but the precisions of the results are usually not satisfied in practice. This paper studies the application of artificial neural network in corporate financial risk early-warning. It designs an early warning model of financial risk based on BP neural network. And then selects financial data from 30 enterprises as samples to train and test the network. The result indicates that the risk early warning model is very effective. It can solve some problems of the traditional early warning methods such as difficult to deal with highly non-linear and lack of adaptive capacity.",
