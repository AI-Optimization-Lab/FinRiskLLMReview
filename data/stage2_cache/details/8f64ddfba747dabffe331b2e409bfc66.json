    "title": "Option pricing under a normal mixture distribution derived from the Markov tree model",
    "abstract": "We examine a Markov tree (MT) model for option pricing in which the dynamics of the underlying asset are modeled by a non-IID process. We show that the discrete probability mass function of log returns generated by the tree is closely approximated by a continuous mixture of two normal distributions. Using this normal mixture distribution and risk-neutral pricing, we derive a closed-form expression for European call option prices. We also suggest a regression tree-based method for estimating three volatility parameters sigma, sigma(+), and sigma(-) required to apply the MT model. We apply the MT model to price call options on 89 non-dividend paying stocks from the S&P 500 index. For each stock symbol on a given day, we use the same parameters to price options across all strikes and expires. Comparing against the Black-Scholes model, we find that the MT model's prices are closer to market prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
