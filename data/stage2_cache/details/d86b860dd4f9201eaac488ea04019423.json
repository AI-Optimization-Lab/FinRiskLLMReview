    "abstract": "As we all know, our current financial credit system is not so perfect, commercial banks are facing huge credit risks everyday. In this paper, we are supposed to construct a model to evaluate the credit risk of commercial bank based on BP neutral network. We also proceed research on possibility of its application to the credit risk analysis. Finally, with a case study, we prove that the scientific credit decisions can be made by commercial banks via the model.",
