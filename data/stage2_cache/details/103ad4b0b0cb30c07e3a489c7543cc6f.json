    "abstract": "Establishing the financial risk early-warning model of large data company is of great significance for the development of large data industry. This paper takes the electronic information industry as the representative's large data listed company as the sample, uses the Life table analysis and the multilayer perceptron neural network to the big data industry listed company's financial risk research. The results show that the big data industry listed companies are prone to financial crisis in the 2-8 years of listing, and 8 years later, the probability of financial crisis is small; the financial risk early warning model based on multilayer perceptron neural network has many predictive effects, and the prediction accuracy is more than 99%.",
