    "title": "RETRACTED: Construction of business strategic planning structure model based on deep learning algorithm (Retracted Article)",
    "abstract": "This article analyzes the factors that affect business strategy. Based on the deep learning algorithm, we obtain a three-dimensional analytical framework of business strategy portfolio from the perspective of policy tools, policy objectives, and policy strength. It measures the characteristics of the business strategy portfolio from three aspects of comprehensiveness, consistency, and balance, and an improved deep learning analysis method is used to measure the impact of policy combination characteristics on business strategy effects, and then to clarify the effects of different types of business strategy combinations. The results concluded that there are significant differences in the effects of the business strategy portfolio characteristics. The macroeconomic effects of the combination of policy tools are simulated and analyzed, and the differences in their effects under different policy objectives and policy strengths are compared and analyzed. The prediction accuracy of the model reaches 98.57%.",
