    "title": "Information Theoretic Cutting of a Cake",
    "abstract": "Cutting a cake is a metaphor for the problem of dividing a resource (cake) among several agents. The problem becomes non-trivial when the agents have different valuations for different parts of the cake (i.e. one agent may like chocolate while the other may like cream). A fair division of the cake is one that takes into account the individual valuations of agents and partitions the cake based on some fairness criterion. Fair division may be accomplished in a distributed or centralized way. Due to its natural and practical appeal, it has been a subject of study in economics under the topic of Fair Division. To best of our knowledge the role of partial information in fair division has not been studied so far from an information theoretic perspective. In this paper we study two important algorithms in fair division, namely divide and choose and adjusted winner for the case of two agents. We quantify the benefit of negotiation in the divide and choose algorithm, and its use in tricking the adjusted winner algorithm. Lastly we consider a centralized algorithm for maximizing the overall welfare of the agents under the Nash collective utility function (CUF). This corresponds to a clustering problem. Drawing a conceptual link between this problem and the portfolio selection problem in stock markets, we prove an upper bound on the increase of the Nash CUF for a clustering refinement.",
