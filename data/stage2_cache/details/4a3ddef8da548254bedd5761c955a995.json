    "title": "Regional models assessing region-specific determinants of low birth weight in India",
    "abstract": "Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as birth weight less than 2.5 kg. LBW infants remain at a relatively higher risk of mortality than those with normal birth weight. This is still a major public health problem in developing countries like India. Data from the third round of the National Family Health Survey were used for this study. The multivariable logistic regression model demonstrated a significant association between the reporting of birth weight, and education level and financial status. Furthermore, as the rate of parity increased, the odds for reporting of birth weights decreased in the northern, central and eastern regions of India.",
