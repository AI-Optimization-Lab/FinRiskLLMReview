    "abstract": "This paper analyzed the Chinese communication enterprises of investment in information technology project risk and establishing the index system of risk evaluation, at the same time used the risk evaluation of rough sets and SVM in communication enterprise investment project, comprehensive and objective measured the investment project of macro environmental risk, financial risk, economic risk management and technology. By using the theory of rough set to reduce the risk of numerous data, elimination of redundant risk evaluation index, the author used the SVM to evaluate the risk of information system project. The empirical evidence shows that, risk assessment of SVM for information system project based on rough sets, has the very strong practicability and accuracy.",
