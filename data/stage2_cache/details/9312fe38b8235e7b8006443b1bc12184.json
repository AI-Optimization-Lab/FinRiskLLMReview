    "title": "Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Forecast Fusion and Optimal Portfolio Rebalancing",
    "abstract": "Portfolio selection is complicated by the difficulty of forecasting financial time series and the sensitivity of portfolio optimisers to forecasting errors. To address these issues, a portfolio management model is proposed that makes use of Deep Learning Models for weekly financial time series forecasting of returns. Our model uses a late fusion of an ensemble of forecast models and modifies the standard mean-variance optimiser to account for transaction costs, making it suitable for multi-period trading. Our empirical results show that our portfolio management tool outperforms the equally-weighted portfolio benchmark and the buy-and-hold strategy, using both Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit forecasts. Although the portfolios are profitable, they are also sub-optimal in terms of their risk to reward ratio. Therefore, greater forecasting accuracy is necessary to construct truly optimal portfolios.",
