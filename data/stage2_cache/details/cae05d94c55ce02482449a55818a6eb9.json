    "abstract": "Raw environmental management is an essential factor in the successful implementation of strategic power. Environmental management improves the level need to manage innovation. If get called substitution, the environmental management of change of, ecological to realization, must be sustainable economic development. With environmental and economic policies and market management, the portfolio management machine learns the ecological environment's essential benefits. Existing environmental protection measures and environmental management methods on (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) FPGA-based machine learning ecology ecological significance analysis of current development, must establish an ecological compensation mechanism by the current FPGA environmental management. Assumptions. Due to the lack of laws and regulations, an essential factor in the overall management of the ecological environment and environmental management practices. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a legal system of ecological compensation law. The establishment of ecological compensation is clear, eco-taxes, ecological compensation fund system, and ecological management and oversight point to explore current FPGA environmental management.",
