    "title": "THE MEXICAN STOCK EXCHANGE PERFORMANCE AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008: AN APPLICATION OF DATA MINING",
    "abstract": "We explore different forecasting models of machine learning to analyze the Mexican Stock Exchange (PQI) performance after the 2008 crisis. These models have shown good forecasting capabilities both for multivariable and univariable approaches given their non-parametric features. The following variables, from financial theory, were selected: Index Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), National Index of Prices to Consumer (NIPC), Consumer Price Index (CPI), International Reserves (IR), Yields on Treasury Certificates (CETES28), the Mexican peso-dollar Exchange Rate (USDMX), Monetary Aggregate 1 (M1) and Sovereign Default Risk of Mexico (SDRM). The models were evaluated with Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) metric and compared to Linear Regression (LR) and Neural Nets (NN) models. The results show that the models had similar performance according to the error percentages they presented to those of LR and NN; in some cases, with better performance.",
