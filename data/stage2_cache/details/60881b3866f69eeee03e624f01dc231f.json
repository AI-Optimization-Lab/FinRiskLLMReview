    "title": "ECB communication sentiments: How do they relate to the economic environment and financial markets?",
    "abstract": "In this paper we examine multiple dimensions of ECB monetary policy communication by identifying its sentiment and relation with the economic environment and financial markets. We quantify communication sentiment using transcripts from official ECB communication events - press conferences, accounts and Executive Board speeches - as well as media reactions that highlight the key messages of those events. Importantly, we create distinctive lexicons for both of those communication types. We find that the overall trends in the sentiment indices for the analysed communication events closely resemble the movements of monetary policy stance as well as inflation dynamics in the euro area, both before and after the COVID-19 shock period. The communication tone generally shifts in advance of actual monetary policy actions. Using regression analysis, we find some expected, statistically significant effects of press conference sentiment on bank stock prices (information-type shock) and identify the impact of Executive Board speeches on euro area risk-free rates. Fragmentation issues among euro area member states do not seem to be negatively affected by the sentiments of the ECB's communication. Still, policy makers should be aware that the tone of their communication events is likely to affect particular financial markets. These results are confirmed by various robustness checks.",
