    "title": "Problems and Countermeasures of Financial Risk in Project Management Based on Convolutional Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Under the background of market economy, engineering projects are faced with a lot of financial risks. If we cannot prevent them effectively, it will undoubtedly bring serious negative impact to the entire engineering management work. Therefore, it is particularly important to actively manage risks, identify and evaluate risks in a timely and correct manner, manage risks efficiently, and minimize risk losses. At the same time, the development of wireless communication technology has brought many new branches of engineering project management. Some problems in the process of risk management are often not handled by traditional empirical calculation or mathematical methods, so it is necessary to find an appropriate way to define and describe the nonlinear relationship between a large number of uncertain causes and risk losses. In order to match the changes in the background of the development of wireless communication technology, this paper studies the financial risk problems and countermeasures in the engineering management of convolutional neural networks. The financial risk prediction model in network engineering management is constructed, and the volume neural network algorithm referenced by it is tested. The test results are highly consistent with the expert assessment. In the research process, the combination of questionnaire survey and mathematical analysis method was adopted, the extreme value of risk factors was determined by questionnaire survey, and then the accuracy of prediction was verified by a mathematical model. After many calculations, it has been proved that the convolutional neural network simulation system based on the scientific node selection method has greatly improved the accuracy of risk assessment.",
