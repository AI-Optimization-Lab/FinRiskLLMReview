    "abstract": "Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the best known and most heavily used measures of financial risk. In this paper, we introduce a non-iterative semiparametric model for VaR estimation called the single index quantile regression time series (SIQRTS) model. To test its performance, we give an application to four major US market indices: the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the NASDAQ Composite Index. Our results suggest that this method has a good finite sample performance and often outperforms a number of commonly used methods.",
