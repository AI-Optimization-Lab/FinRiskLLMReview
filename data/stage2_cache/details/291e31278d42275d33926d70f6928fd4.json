    "title": "A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Stock Portfolio Optimization",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a recently concerned research field for stock portfolio optimization. The existing solutions face various challenge. In this paper, we propose a DRL framework to the stock portfolio optimization problem, which mainly includes the following three contributions: 1) We propose an Over-fitting Prevention Objective Function (OPOF) to avoid over-fitting in the training process. 2) An algorithm called Batch-Forward Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (BFRRL) is proposed to improve the stability of the training process. 3) A neural network called Multi Times Scale Transformer (MTS-Trans) is proposed to enhance stock series local feature extraction ability in multiple time scales. Compared with the current SOTA algorithm, our approach improves returns by 63% in the Chinese stock market and 138% in the U.S. stock market, while the strategy's risk is also reduced.",
