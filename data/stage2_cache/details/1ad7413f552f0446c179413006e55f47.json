    "title": "Implementation of Improved Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm in Stock Market Segment Analysis and Forecasting",
    "abstract": "In order to overcome the problems in low optimization precision, slow convergence speed and easy falling into local optimality, the optimization algorithm of basic fruit fly optimization algorithm variable-steps is proposed. When entering the iteration, the estimation value of the best taste concentration and the number of current iterations are adapted from the iteration. At the same time, the step length of fruit fly moving is used to enhance the local optimization ability in the later period of algorithm, and the global and local optimization performance of the algorithm is effectively weighed. At last, we use the improved clustering algorithm to cluster the financial data of 200 listed companies, to excavate the hidden rules behind the information, and to analyze the management ability and development potential of the listed companies, guiding the investors to invest rationally, and providing theoretical basis for reducing the investment risk.",
