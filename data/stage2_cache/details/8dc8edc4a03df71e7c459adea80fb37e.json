    "title": "Credit Risk Classification Using Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machines",
    "abstract": "Credit risk analysis plays an important role in the financial market. In this paper, discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is used in credit risk classification. RBM is a generative model associated with an undirected graph, which can capture complicated features from observed data, and after introducing discriminative component into RBM, it can be used to train a non-linear classifier. The method is tested in a real-world credit risk prediction task, and the empirical results demonstrate the advantage of the method over other competing ones.",
