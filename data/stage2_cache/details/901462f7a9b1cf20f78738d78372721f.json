    "title": "Explainable machine learning for financial risk management: two practical use cases",
    "abstract": "We explore the potential of machine learning (ML) models applied in two financial risk management areas, i.e., credit risk management and financial risk hedging, through two practical use cases. This comparative study starts with the issue of explainability in complex ML models used in peer-to-peer lending for credit risk management. The first use case examines the limitations of using Kernel-SHAP with dependent features and evaluates different methods for estimating these dependencies using the Lending Club dataset. Our results suggest that accounting for feature dependence improves the understanding and robustness of prediction explanations. The second use case investigates a dynamic method for hedging foreign exchange risk in international equity portfolios, emphasizing the importance of accurate forecasts of currency returns. The analysis demonstrates that predictions yielded by ML models can significantly enhance the hedging of portfolios against currency risk. These findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced ML models in financial risk management, showcasing their capability to improve financial risk measurement and management. Further, our study outlines future research directions to advance this field.",
