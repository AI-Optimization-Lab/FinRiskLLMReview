    "title": "Evaluating Fintech industry's risks: A preliminary analysis based on CRISP-DM framework",
    "abstract": "The Fintech sector has grown rapidly since the 2008 global financial crisis. The growth of the industry has thereafter been shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis with substantial implications for economic stability. The risk profile of fintech firms was examined using the CRISP-DM framework, which facilitated the classification and clustering of algorithms and regression models. This paper provides insights into assessing financial risk by combining econometric modeling and machine learning techniques.",
