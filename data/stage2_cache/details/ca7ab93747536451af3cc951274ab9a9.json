    "title": "Data Mining in Credit Card Approval: Feature Importance Testing Comparison",
    "abstract": "Understanding the significance of features in data mining is crucial for accurately analyzing customer behavior, constructing reliable credit scoring models, and detecting fraud within the credit card approval process. This paper explores the application of data mining techniques in the credit industry, with a specific focus on credit card approval classification. We investigate seven feature importance testing techniques and three classification methods, assessing their performance through various metrics. The research demonstrates that FLOFO with linear regression and ShapFlex with agnostic causal relations substantially improve the performance of all classifiers, with SVM emerging as the most effective classifier across all feature selection techniques. Feature importance testing is pivotal as it not only enhances model accuracy but also provides deeper insights into the factors driving credit card approval decisions. The findings underscore the essential role of data mining in financial risk analysis and credit approval processes, offering valuable perspectives for advancing research and practices in financial technology. The results emphasize the potential of specific feature importance testing techniques and classificationmethods in refining credit card approval classification tasks.",
