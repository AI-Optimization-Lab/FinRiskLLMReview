    "abstract": "In this paper, we use the modern management theory to build a corporate financial risk early warning indicator system, while using the statistical method of principal component analysis and logistic regression analysis. Through the empirical research on listed companies' financial crisis situation, we established the company's financial early warning model to provide a scientific and feasible prediction method for enterprises to predict the financial crisis.",
