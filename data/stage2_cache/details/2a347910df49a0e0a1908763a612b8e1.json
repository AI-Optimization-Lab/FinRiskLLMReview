    "title": "IMPORTANCE SAMPLING FOR COVAR ESTIMATION",
    "abstract": "Measuring systemic risk has been an important problem in financial risk management. The CoVaR, as one of the commonly used systemic risk measures, could capture the tail dependency of the losses between financial institutions and financial systems. CoVaR is estimated via several statistical methods like quantile regression. In this paper, considering the complexity of the constituent securities in the financial institution and financial systems, we propose a simulation approach to estimate the CoVaR. We investigate the use of importance sampling to reduce the variance of the CoVaR estimator, and propose an efficient importance sampling distribution based on large deviation principles. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our approach via numerical experiments.",
