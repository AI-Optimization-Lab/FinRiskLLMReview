    "title": "Combining random forest and multicollinearity modeling for index tracking",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the combination of random forest (RF) and classical statistical modeling. We propose two algorithms: RF cluster + ridge and RF regression + ridge, in which the RF reduces overfitting and has a good anti-noise ability. The ridge regression can effectively handle the correlated data by the ridge penalty. To test the performance of the proposed techniques, we model and track the S&P 500 index. Index tracking aims to replicate the returns of an index fund and is very popular in finance. We compare the performance of the proposed methods with those of several existing methods. The portfolio obtained by each technique is quantified using the tracking error. We find that this combination always has higher accuracy. Empirical results show that the proposed methods are qualified for index funds. Our findings shed light on the synthesis of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques and provide an effective practice of this combination.",
