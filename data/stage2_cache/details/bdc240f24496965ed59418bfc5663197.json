    "abstract": "Objectives: In this study, the effects of sociodemographic and clinical factors on heart failure (HF) readmission risk were examined. Background: Hospitals now incur financial penalties for excessive HF readmission rates; therefore, identifying factors associated with risk is essential for designing risk-reduction strategies. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using chart reviews compared HF inpatients (N = 245) who were readmitted with those who were not readmitted. Results: The sample included mostly white (64%) elderly (mean [SD] age, 69.8 [15.1] years) men (49%) and women (51%). Using Cox regression, the number of comorbidities (3-4 or 5-8) and type of comorbidities, specifically renal insufficiency (readmission ratio [RR], 1.7; P = .003), atrial fibrillation (RR, 1.7; P = .005), cardiomyopathy (RR, 1.5; P = .020), followed by a history of myocardial infarction/coronary artery disease (RR, 1.4; P = .055), were the predictors of HF readmission. Conclusions: Targeting those with high-risk comorbidities is important in designing measures to prevent or delay readmission of HF patients.",
