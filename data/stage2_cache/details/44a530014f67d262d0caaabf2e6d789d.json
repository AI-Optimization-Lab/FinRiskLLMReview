    "abstract": "This paper addresses the development of an early-warning model for the risk of financial derivatives' (FD). The risks of derivatives are so complicated and the speed of spread is so rapid, that understanding the exact risk of FD by disclosure is needed. An early-warming model for derivatives is designed. After being trained and learning 342 times, the results indicate that early-warning of the risk of derivatives based on back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) can be achieved.",
