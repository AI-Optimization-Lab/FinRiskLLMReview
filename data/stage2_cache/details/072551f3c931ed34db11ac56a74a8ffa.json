    "title": "Applications of Machine and Deep Learning in Funding Decision: A Review",
    "abstract": "In corporate finance, a number of conventional techniques are being replaced by machine and deep learning algorithms as a result of artificial intelligence advancements. These tools of artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize society and various aspects of the economy, including corporate finance. This paper is dedicated to a review of the applications of machine and deep learning algorithms in corporate finance decisions throughout the funding process. These algorithms can be used to assess current or future funding needs, explore the various funding options available to the company, choose the most appropriate funding method, prepare the funding file, and manage the risks inherent in funding. These modern technological tools are indispensable for navigating an increasingly complex and competitive financial environment. Their strategic use helps optimize financial decisions and maximize growth opportunities, from the beginning stages of planning to continuous risk management. By using them, decision-making is enhanced, resource allocation is optimized, and profitable growth is guaranteed.",
