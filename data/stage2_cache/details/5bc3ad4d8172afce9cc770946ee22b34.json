    "abstract": "The development of small and medium-sized enterprise of Science and Technology (SMES) is restricted by the financial difficulties. As a result, constructing a targeted credit evaluation model to provide data support for the financing become an emerging research area. The key challenge of this problem is to establish a set of special models of credit rating with high precision for SMES. In this paper, several classical classification algorithms are adopted to set up different risk assessment models. The experimental comparison is illustrated using R (A famous programming language, which can achieve the best evaluation model more clearly). In addition, our experimental comparison can reduce the impact of asymmetric information between enterprises and financial institutions, and to break the bottleneck of financing difficulties for SMES fundamentally.",
