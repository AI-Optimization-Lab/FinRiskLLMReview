    "title": "Analysis of the relationship between geometric parameters of railway track and twist failure by using data mining techniques",
    "abstract": "Maintaining railway tracks is capital intensive, time consuming and safety-critical. Novel main-tenance methods can decrease these costs and improve efficiency by analysis of collected data from tracks. Twist is one of the common track failures, which poses the risk of derailment, fa-talities, injuries and financial loss. In this paper, track parameters are studied for part of a major railway route in Iran. Polynomial regression and association rules, which are popular data mining approaches are used to discover relationship between twist failure with failures of other track parameters for the period between 2018 and 2020. The results show that alignment and super elevation have the highest impact on twist and most of the times these failures occur simulta-neously. By adopting this approach twist failure can be identified in order to avoid chain failure and move toward condition-based maintenance.",
