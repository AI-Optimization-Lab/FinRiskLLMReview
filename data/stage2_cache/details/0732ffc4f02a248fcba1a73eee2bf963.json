    "title": "A novel hybrid credit scoring model based on ensemble feature selection and multilayer ensemble classification",
    "abstract": "Credit scoring focuses on the development of empirical models to support the financial decision-making processes of financial institutions and credit industries. It makes use of applicants' historical data and statistical or machine learning techniques to assess the risk associated with an applicant. However, the historical data may consist of redundant and noisy features that affect the performance of credit scoring models. The main focus of this paper is to develop a hybrid model, combining feature selection and a multilayer ensemble classifier framework, to improve the predictive performance of credit scoring. The proposed hybrid credit scoring model is modeled in three phases. The initial phase constitutes preprocessing and assigns ranks and weights to classifiers. In the next phase, the ensemble feature selection approach is applied to the preprocessed dataset. Finally, in the last phase, the dataset with the selected features is used in a multilayer ensemble classifier framework. In addition, a classifier placement algorithm based on the Choquet integral value is designed, as the classifier placement affects the predictive performance of the ensemble framework. The proposed hybrid credit scoring model is validated on real-world credit scoring datasets, namely, Australian, Japanese, German-categorical, and German-numerical datasets.",
