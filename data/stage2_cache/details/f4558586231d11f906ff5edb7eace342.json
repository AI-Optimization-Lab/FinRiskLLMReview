    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved considerable success across a spectrum of computer vision tasks, with applications ranging from healthcare to automated driving. Recent literature has also explored its potential utility in trading and risk management within the finance industry. Despite their versatility, CNNs are substantially constrained by their data-hungry nature. The lack of well-labeled image datasets poses a major challenge to the widespread adoption of CNNs in financial machine learning research across academia and industry. To address these concerns, this work presents Generative-CNN, a novel approach that utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthetically generate images to enhance the performance of a CNN with applications in trading.",
