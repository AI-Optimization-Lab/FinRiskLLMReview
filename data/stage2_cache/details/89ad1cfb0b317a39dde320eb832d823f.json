    "title": "Estimation of quantitative rating systems and application to bond rating prediction",
    "abstract": "The topic of this paper falls within the area of credit risk measurement and modelling, specifically the problem of bond rating models estimation. There are various approaches that can be used to develop an automated rating system, such as econometric models based on historical data on past defaults, neural networks or structural models. The approach in this paper is based on a database of rating decisions of a certified rating agency. Using a logistic regression technique, the model to bond rating prediction can be estimated. Ordinal logistic regression can be used to investigate the relationship between rating and various independent variables such as financial ratios, macroeconomic indicators or selected qualitative factors with a potential effect on rating. In comparison with multiple logistic regressions, this approach enables to consider the nature and ordinal ranking of rating assessment. The paper aims at using the ordinal regression on selected corporate bonds to build a bond prediction model based on Moody's external rating. The methodology will be explained in the first part of this paper, the next chapters are devoted to the model estimation and interpretation of results.",
