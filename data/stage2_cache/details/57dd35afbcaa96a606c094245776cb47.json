    "title": "Financial System Risk Warning Based on Deep earning",
    "abstract": "As the global economy transitions towards a trajectory of high-quality development, the underlying risks within the financial system are becoming increasingly conspicuous. To precisely identify and effectively address these risks, this paper introduces a financial system risk warning based on a deep learning model. The objective is to notably enhance the accuracy of predicting enterprise financial risks and improve the responsiveness of the warning mechanism. In this study, we harness the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to develop an efficient CNN-LSTM model. Through rigorous experimental validation and analysis, CNN-LSTM model exhibits outstanding performance in the task of financial risk warning. It not only enhances the precision of early warning but also significantly bolsters the stability and reliability of the warning system.",
