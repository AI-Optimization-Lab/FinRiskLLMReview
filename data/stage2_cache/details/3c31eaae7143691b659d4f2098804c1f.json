    "title": "A Fund Selection Robo-Advisor with Deep-learning Driven Market Prediction",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new investment strategy with deep -learning market prediction for mutual fund portfolio optimization. Our strategy uses the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that applies macroeconomic factors to predict whether the market is bull or hear. Then, we develop a robo-advisor (RA) to predict future market, optimize portfolio and automate investment. Experiments use 22 years' data of S&P500 and mutual funds of U.S. to validate our strategy. Results show that the accuracy of our market prediction method can reach 84.3% and the rate -of-return of our RA is 13.87%. Our model is more accurate and profitable than other algorithms.",
