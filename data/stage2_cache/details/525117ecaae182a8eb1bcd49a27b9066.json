    "abstract": "P>We developed a method for selectively propagating disease-related autoreactive T-cell lines (auTCLs) based on their increased resistance to apoptosis. The generated auTCLs homogeneously co-express CD45RO and CD49a, adhere strongly to extracellular matrix proteins and express high interleukin-17 (IL-17) messenger RNA levels, resembling a T-cell subset proposed to transmigrate into tissues and induce systemic and local inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. The combinations of T-cell oligoclones that comprise probable multiple sclerosis (pMS) disease-related lines use a unique portfolio of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable allele (BV genes) combinations forming 'disease-specific cluster patterns'. The auTCL derived from different patients and from different myelin epitopes display striking similarities in BV gene allele clusters and are derived primarily from a disease-prone hotspot residing in the BV gene locus between V beta 6 and V beta 9. Conversely, healthy subject TCLs use different BV gene allele sets, forming 'healthy responder usage formats'. These formats were absent from the pMS patient V-beta gene allele combinations evaluated in this study. Hierarchical clustering of the BV gene combinations, distinguish three pMS auTCL groups, implying existence of up to three disease-related immune response patterns. These subgroup patterns may reflect different disease subclasses or alternatively they may suggest immune reactivity to different aetiological agents. Analyses of clonal-clustering patterns may potentially aid in subclassification of MS or in characterizing aetiological agents of this disease.",
