    "abstract": "According to the practical situation of credit risk assessment in commercial banks, a set of index system is established. The index system includes financial indexes and non-financial indexes. Then support vector machines (SVM) algorithm is used for assessment in this research. In the method, training sets are selected by the increasing proportions. Proportions are determined by the number of samples. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, a real case is given and the experimental results show that the model has high correct classification accuracy.",
