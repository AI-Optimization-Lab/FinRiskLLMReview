    "title": "Risk sharing with deep neural networks",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of optimally sharing a financial position among agents with potentially different reference risk measures. The problem is equivalent to computing the infimal convolution of the risk metrics and finding the so-called optimal allocations. We propose a neural network-based framework to solve the problem and we prove the convergence of the approximated inf-convolution, as well as the approximated optimal allocations, to the corresponding theoretical values. We support our findings with several numerical experiments.",
