    "title": "Financial Engineering and Computer Science: Application of Deep Learning in the Field of Big Data Finance: Taking Stock Forecasting Analysis for Example",
    "abstract": "With the advent of the cloud era, big data technology has become more and more important strategic significance. People apply massive data analysis to various industries and functional fields. Financial markets are known for the volatility of risk and reward. Centering on the new research direction of deep learning, this paper analyzes the internal rules of sample data, specifically applies it to BP neural network model, and discusses its role in stock prediction and analysis, so as to promote its application to the financial field.",
