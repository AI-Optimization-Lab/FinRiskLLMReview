    "title": "Government Bondholding of Commercial Banks in the Central European Countries before and during the Financial and Debt Crisis",
    "abstract": "The financial and debt crisis has affected all sectors of economy including the financial markets. It has also impacted the risk aversion of investors, when under increasing debt burden some European countries were unable to meet their liabilities resulting from sovereign bonds on time. This changed the view of state bonds as one of the safest form of investment. Our main aim in this working paper is to examine the evolution of government bondholding of commercial banks in the CE countries and to assess the impact of selected factors on this bondholding in the period before and during the debt crisis namely sovereign credit rating evolution, state bond yields, stock market performance, sustainability of public finance and general risk aversion on the financial market in Eurozone. The regression is estimated by using panel data regression. Our analysis for the crisis period suggests that there is a statistically significant impact of stock market performance and risk aversion on the bank bondholding.",
