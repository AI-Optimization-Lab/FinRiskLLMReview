    "title": "A New Model of Enterprise Credit Risk Assessment Based on BP Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Enterprise credit risk assessment is a very important problem in the financial field. Its deficiency was revealed because of singly using BP neural network. In this paper, a new assessment model is proposed which is based on an optimized BP Neural Network. In this model, first, dimensions of data were reduced by principal component analysis (PCA); second, Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) was used for optimizing parameters of BP neural network. The experiment results show that the new model reduces the training time and has a very small error; it can satisfy the demand of credit risk assessment of enterprise.",
