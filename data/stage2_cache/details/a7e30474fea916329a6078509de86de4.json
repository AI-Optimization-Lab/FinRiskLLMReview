    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Adaptive Online Intelligent Framework for a Blockchain Application in Risk Control of Asset Securitization",
    "abstract": "Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have attracted massive attention from both legal communities and businesses. Asset securitization is the procedure in which an issuer designs a financial instrument that is marketable by combining or merging different financial assets into one group. However, most securitization occurs with loans and other assets that generate receivables, such as consumer or business debt of various types. This article discusses the possible benefits of blockchain during the securitization process using the deep learning-based adaptive online intelligent framework (DLAOIF). The benefits can be significant, from reduced costs, time, and fraud risks to increased safety, trust, and accuracy. Tracking financial assets on a blockchain can reduce dependence on credit rating organizations and allow investors to monitor asset performance and the associated risk more carefully. It should improve investor confidence and increase secondary market interest.",
