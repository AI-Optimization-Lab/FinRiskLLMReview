    "abstract": "With the deepening of the global political and economic system reform, the third sector between the government and for-profit enterprises-non-profit organizations has developed rapidly as a public welfare sector, and its impact on the society is also increasing. At present, non-profit organizations are in a critical period of social organization reform, and the safety and reliability of financial affairs within the organization has gradually become an important measure for their long-term development in the future.
