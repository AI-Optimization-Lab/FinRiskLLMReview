    "abstract": "This article selects the data of 28 hotel and tourism enterprises on A-shares in china. The investment risk early-warning system construction is based on the information entropy method and the BP neural network. The results show that most of Chinese hotel and tourism enterprises have a high level of investment risk due to the effects of financial crisis and operation, and all of them need to enhance prevention measures.",
