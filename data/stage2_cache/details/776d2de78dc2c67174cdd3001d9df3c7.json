    "title": "Error identification in the enforcement process - What can be achieved with computational linguistics?",
    "abstract": "Using information on concluded enforcement examinations provided by the German capital market authority (BaFin), this paper examines the extent to which firms with error-finding and errorfree examination results differ in their linguistic characteristics and whether those characteristics are a supplementary indicator for potentially erroneous financial reports in the risk-oriented selection of firms. An effective riskoriented selection of the firms to be examined is decisive for an efficient error identification and thus for ensuring high accounting and financial reporting quality and the avoidance of redundant burdens for companies. In view of the current accounting scandal of the Wirecard AG, testing of various methods for identifying errors is an obvious step. The results of this study indicate that financial reports with and without error-finding differ in their linguistic characteristics and that the use of linguistic characteristics alongside financial characteristics helps to identify erroneous financial reports using classification models.",
