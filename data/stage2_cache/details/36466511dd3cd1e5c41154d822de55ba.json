    "abstract": "The accumulating financial risk of the enterprises is the dominant factor that leading companies to crisis. The main measures to prevent corporate crisis are to enhance the elimination and the management of the financial risk. The early warning of the financial risk is the process which carries out multi-angle analysis of judgments to the likelihood of the corporate financial risk and timely issue the crisis warnings.
