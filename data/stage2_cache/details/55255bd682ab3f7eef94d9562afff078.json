    "title": "In Search of Prof. Aurum-A Mobile Escape Room Setting for Youth Recreation",
    "abstract": "Within the past decade, escape rooms have aroused great social and educational interest. Their potential for intra- and extracurricular learning ranges from the promotion of methodical and communicative competencies to problem-solving and teamwork strategies. As a nonformal learning environment, the youth leisure sector is suitable for the integration of such formats and thus combines active learning with motivating, social interaction. In Search of Prof. Aurum is a science-oriented environment in which adolescents aged 12 to 16 use chemical experiments to track down the vanishing of the famous (fictional) professor. The innovative mobile character of the setting expands the portfolio of edutainment escape rooms and through evaluation allows conclusions to be drawn about possible innovative event formats in the youth leisure sector.",
