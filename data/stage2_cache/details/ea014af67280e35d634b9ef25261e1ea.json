    "title": "Credit Evaluation of Technology-Based Small and Micro Enterprises: An Innovative Weighting Method Based on Machine Learning and AHP",
    "abstract": "Technology-based small and micro enterprises play a crucial role in national economic and social development. Managing their credit risk effectively is key to ensuring their healthy growth. This study is based on corporate credit management theory and Wu's three-dimensional credit theory. It clarifies the credit concept and measurement logic of these enterprises, considering their unique development characteristics in China. A credit evaluation system is constructed, and an innovative method combining machine learning with comprehensive evaluation is proposed. This approach aims to assess the credit status of technology-based small and micro enterprises in a thorough and objective manner. The study finds that, first, the credit level of these enterprises is currently moderate, with little variation. Second, financial information remains a key factor in credit evaluation. Third, the ML-AHP (Machine Learning-Analytic Hierarchy Process) combined weighting method effectively integrates subjective experience with objective data, providing a more rational assessment. The findings provide theoretical references and practical guidance for the healthy development of technology-based small and micro enterprises, early credit risk warning, and improved financing efficiency.",
