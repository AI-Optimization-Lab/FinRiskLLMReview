    "title": "A Fuzzy Random Survival Forest for Predicting Lapses in Insurance Portfolios Containing Imprecise Data",
    "abstract": "We propose a fuzzy random survival forest (FRSF) to model lapse rates in a life insurance portfolio containing imprecise or incomplete data such as missing, outlier, or noisy values. Following the random forest methodology, the FRSF is proposed as a new machine learning technique for solving time-to-event data using an ensemble of multiple fuzzy survival trees. In the learning process, the combination of methods such as the c-index, fuzzy sets theory, and the ensemble of multiple trees enable the automatic handling of imprecise data. We analyse the results of several experiments and test them statistically; they show the FRSF's robustness, verifying that its generalisation capacity is not reduced when modelling imprecise data. Furthermore, the results obtained using a real portfolio of a life insurance company demonstrate that the FRSF has a better performance in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms such as the traditional Cox model and other tree-based machine learning techniques such as the random survival forest.",
