    "title": "Multi-model transfer function approach tuned by PSO for predicting stock market implied volatility explained by uncertainty indexes",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the forecasting power of uncertainty emanating from the commodities market, energy market, economic policy, and geopolitical threats to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). In this study, the relationship between the various uncertainty metrics throughout the period 2012-2022, using a multi-model transfer function technique optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) is estimated. Furthermore, we utilize PSO for parameter optimization within the multi-model framework, improving model performance and convergence speed. According to empirical findings, the CBOE Volatility Index reacts nonlinearly to the uncertainty indices. Specifically, the conclusions of the performance metrics show that the OVX index (MAPE: 4.1559%; RMSE: 1.0476% and W: 96.74%) outperforms the geopolitical risk index, the Bloomberg energy index, and the economic policy uncertainty index in predicting the volatility of the US equities market. Although individual models have generated respectful performance, results from the aggregate simulation show that when all predictors are combined, they simultaneously provide better performance indicators (MAVE: 2.7511 %; RMSE: 0.7361%; R2: 98.93%) than when they are estimated separately. In addition, results provide evidence that, when considering non-linear patterns in the data, the multi-model transfer function technique calibrated using PSO demonstrates its outperformance over autoregressive baseline models, traditional econometric models, and deep learning techniques. The effectiveness and accuracy of the multi-model transfer function method tuned by PSO as a forecasting tool are confirmed by the convergence analysis of the cost function. Our methodology innovates by employing a multi-model transfer function technique, which captures the complex and nonlinear relationships between uncertainty indicators and the VIX more comprehensively than traditional single-model approaches. These results are important for traders in terms of hedging as well as portfolio diversification by investing in defensive equities and for policymakers in terms of reliability and preciseness of volatility forecasts.",
