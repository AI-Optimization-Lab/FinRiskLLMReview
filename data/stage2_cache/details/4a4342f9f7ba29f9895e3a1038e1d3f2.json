    "title": "A novel recurrent neural network based prediction system for trading",
    "abstract": "To reduce their exposure to price fluctuations in the markets, traders are increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities. There is thus a need to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions to capture the complex dynamics of price processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using a recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of commodities such as gold and currencies. The price predictions, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments show that the trading system can, when using the proposed network and strategy, form portfolios yielding a return on investment of nearly 5%.",
