It specifically mentions the use of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method and does not involve any machine learning methods, as stated in the abstract: 'Whilst this technique does not exploit machine learning methods applied to large amounts of trained data, it is, nevertheless, systemic and evolutive.' Therefore, none of the provided keywords related to machine learning and its various subfields are relevant to this paper."
