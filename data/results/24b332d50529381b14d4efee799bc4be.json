    "reason": "The paper focuses on analyzing the mean-variance capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and downside risk-based CAPM (DR-CAPM) in the context of the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). It employs econometric methods such as generalized method of moments (GMM) and generalized least squares (GLS) for regression analysis. The study does not involve any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies mentioned in the provided keywords. The research is centered on financial econometrics and risk analysis rather than machine learning or artificial intelligence."
