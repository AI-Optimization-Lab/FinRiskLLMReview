    "reason": "The paper focuses on the analysis of banking internal credit risk measurement models, regulatory capital requirements, and the internal rating-based approach (IRB approach) as defined by the Basel Committee. It discusses key risk components like probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) in the context of risk management and financial performance measurement. There is no mention of machine learning techniques, neural networks, or any other AI-related methodologies in the title or abstract. The content is centered around banking regulations, risk assessment, and financial systems rather than computational or statistical learning methods."
