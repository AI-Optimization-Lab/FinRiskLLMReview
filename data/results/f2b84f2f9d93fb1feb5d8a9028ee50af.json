    "reason": "The paper focuses on analyzing dynamic asymmetric volatility connectedness and risk spillovers between the Green Finance Index and large US technology stocks using econometric methods such as QVAR connectedness framework, quantile Granger causality test, TVPVAR frequency connectedness framework, and quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR). There is no mention of machine learning techniques, neural networks, or any other AI-related methodologies in the title or abstract. The study is grounded in financial econometrics and risk analysis, not in machine learning or deep learning."
