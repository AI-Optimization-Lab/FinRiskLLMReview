    "reason": "The paper focuses on the relationship between CEO succession with gender change (male to female) and audit fees in Chinese firms, examining differences between state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises. The study uses statistical methods such as pooled ordinary least squares regression, firm fixed-effects regression, the two-step Heckman model, and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for analysis. None of the provided keywords related to machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, or other AI techniques are mentioned or implied in the title or abstract. The research is grounded in corporate governance and financial auditing, not in computational or machine learning methods."
