    "reason": "The paper focuses on the application of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) optical texture analysis (ROTA) to detect axonal fiber bundle defects in patients with ocular hypertension. The study involves clinical examinations, OCT imaging, and statistical analysis (e.g., multilevel logistic regression) but does not mention any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies. The analysis is purely based on medical imaging and statistical methods without any reference to the provided keywords."
