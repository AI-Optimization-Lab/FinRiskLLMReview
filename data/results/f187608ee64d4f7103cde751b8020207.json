It discusses structural alerts, decision support systems, and database applications, but does not mention any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or other advanced computational methods listed in the keywords. The methodologies described are more aligned with traditional statistical and rule-based approaches rather than modern machine learning or deep learning techniques."
