It employs empirical methods such as Ordinary Least Squares regression and discusses theoretical approaches like product differentiation and shared efficiency. There is no mention or implication of any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models in the title or abstract. The study is grounded in accounting and auditing practices rather than computational or data science methodologies."
