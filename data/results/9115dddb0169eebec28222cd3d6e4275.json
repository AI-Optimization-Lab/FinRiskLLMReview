    "reason": "The paper focuses on membership attrition dynamics in community-based health insurance using survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox Regression, and the Weibull AFT Model. It does not involve any machine learning or deep learning techniques, nor does it mention any of the specific algorithms or models listed in the keywords. The study is purely statistical and epidemiological in nature, analyzing socioeconomic and program-specific determinants of dropout rates in a health insurance program."
