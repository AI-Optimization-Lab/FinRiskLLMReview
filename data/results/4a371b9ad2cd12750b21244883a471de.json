    "reason": "The paper focuses on examining the dynamics of herding behavior in North American energy stocks using state-space models and quantile-on-quantile regression techniques. It does not mention or utilize any machine learning, deep learning, or related techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks, or any specific algorithms like SVM, decision trees, or CNNs. The study is grounded in financial econometrics and behavioral finance rather than machine learning or artificial intelligence."
