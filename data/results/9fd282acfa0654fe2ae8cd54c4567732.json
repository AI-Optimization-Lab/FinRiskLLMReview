The study does not involve any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models, nor does it discuss any related concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, or other specified keywords. The research is grounded in behavioral finance and decision-making theories rather than computational or statistical learning methods."
