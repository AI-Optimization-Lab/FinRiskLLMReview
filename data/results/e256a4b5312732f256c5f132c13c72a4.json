    "reason": "The paper focuses on the cost analysis of adult-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in a specific hospital setting. It discusses financial aspects, direct costs, and factors associated with high costs in LDLT, such as donor age, acute renal failure, and posttransplant plasma exchange. There is no mention or use of any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models in the study. The research is purely based on retrospective data analysis and statistical methods like logistic regression, which do not fall under the provided list of machine learning and deep learning keywords."
