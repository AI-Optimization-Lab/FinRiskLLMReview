The study uses a cross-sectional survey design and statistical analyses like analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression. There is no mention of any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies in the title or abstract. The research is centered on healthcare outcomes and social factors rather than computational or machine learning approaches."
