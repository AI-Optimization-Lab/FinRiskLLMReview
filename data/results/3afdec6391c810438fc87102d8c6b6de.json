    "reason": "The paper focuses on the relationship between market value, book value, earnings, and bank efficiency in the context of Jordanian banks. It uses traditional statistical methods like OLS, random and fixed effects approaches, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for efficiency measurement. There is no mention or use of machine learning techniques, neural networks, or any other advanced computational methods listed in the keywords. The study is grounded in financial and accounting analysis rather than computational or machine learning approaches."
