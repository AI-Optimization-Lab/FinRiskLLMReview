    "reason": "The paper focuses on the pricing efficiency and determinants of price deviations of exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) using methods like premium/discount analysis, quadratic and linear pricing methods, and regression models. There is no mention or use of machine learning techniques, neural networks, or any other AI-related methodologies in the abstract. The study is grounded in financial econometrics and traditional statistical analysis rather than machine learning or deep learning approaches."
