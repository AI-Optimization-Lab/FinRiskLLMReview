    "machine learning": "The paper discusses the application of a hybrid model combining evolutionary computation, ensemble learning, and deep learning for credit scoring, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning.",

    "classification": "The study focuses on predicting credit scoring, which is a classification problem where the goal is to categorize applicants into different credit risk classes.",
    "support vector machine": "The paper explicitly mentions the use of SVM classifiers as part of the proposed hybrid model.",
    "SVM": "This is an abbreviation for support vector machine, which is a key component of the proposed model.",
    "feature learning": "The paper discusses feature extraction methods and feature selection using genetic algorithms, which are aspects of feature learning.",
    "deep learning": "The proposed approach includes deep learning techniques, as indicated by the mention of a 16-layer genetic cascade ensemble.",
    "representation learning": "The use of deep learning and feature extraction methods implies that the model learns representations of the data, which is a core aspect of representation learning.",
    "hidden layer": "The mention of a 16-layer genetic cascade ensemble suggests the presence of hidden layers in the model's architecture."
