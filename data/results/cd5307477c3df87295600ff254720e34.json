    "reason": "The paper focuses on financial risk protection in health expenditure, specifically modifying measures like impoverishment and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) to better assess financial hardship in Chile. The methods used include logistic regressions to identify factors associated with CHE, but there is no mention of machine learning, deep learning, or any other AI-related techniques in the title or abstract. The study is grounded in health economics and public health rather than computational or data science methodologies."
