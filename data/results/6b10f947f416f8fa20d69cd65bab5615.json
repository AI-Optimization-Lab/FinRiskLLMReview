It does not mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, or any other related keywords. The methodology involves an extensive survey and in-depth analysis of historical cases, followed by the development of a computer-based model with a graphical interface in Visual Basic, which does not involve any machine learning approaches."
