    "reason": "The paper focuses on tail risk dependence analysis of banks in Asian emerging markets using value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) measures, and employs least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression for network construction. The study does not involve any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies listed in the keywords. The analysis is primarily statistical and econometric in nature, focusing on risk measurement and network interconnectedness rather than machine learning or deep learning approaches."
