    "reason": "The paper discusses a framework for chemical safety assessment using new approach methodologies (NAMs) such as in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods within the REACH regulatory framework. It focuses on hazard and exposure assessment, classification categories, safe doses, and risk assessments. None of the provided keywords related to machine learning, neural networks, or other AI techniques are mentioned or implied in the title or abstract. The paper is centered on regulatory and methodological aspects of chemical safety rather than computational or machine learning approaches."
