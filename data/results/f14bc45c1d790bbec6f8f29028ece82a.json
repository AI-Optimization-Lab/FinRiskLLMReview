    "reason": "The paper focuses on the learning curve for achieving competency in upper GI endoscopy (OGD) procedures, specifically analyzing the number of procedures needed to reach a 95% completion rate. The study uses statistical methods like moving average and learning curve cumulative summation (LC-Cusum) analysis, as well as logistic regression, but does not involve any machine learning techniques or related keywords listed. The research is centered on medical training and procedural competency, not on machine learning or its subfields."
