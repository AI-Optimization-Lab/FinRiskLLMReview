    "reason": "The paper focuses on the design of renewable energy portfolio standards (RPSs), specifically analyzing cross-state trading restrictions and state-specific interim annual targets for solar energy. It does not mention or involve any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models, nor does it discuss any related concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or any specific machine learning methods like neural networks, support vector machines, or deep learning. The study is grounded in economic and policy analysis rather than computational or data-driven approaches."
