It discusses factors like website trustworthiness, perceived risks, and consumer behavior in OGB, but does not mention or involve any machine learning techniques, neural networks, deep learning, or related methodologies listed in the keywords. The study is grounded in marketing and consumer behavior research rather than computational or machine learning approaches."
