    "machine learning": "The paper discusses the use of classification trees and ensemble methods (Adaboost and bagging) for evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers, which are machine learning techniques.",
    "supervised learning": "The paper focuses on dichotomous classification of borrowers into creditworthy or non-creditworthy groups, which is a supervised learning task as it involves labeled data.",
    "classification": "The primary aim of the paper is to classify individual borrowers into two groups (creditworthy or non-creditworthy), which is a classification problem.",
