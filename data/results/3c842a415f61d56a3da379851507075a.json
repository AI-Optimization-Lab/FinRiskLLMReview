It does not involve any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models, nor does it discuss any related concepts such as classification, regression, neural networks, or large language models. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey and uses multivariable regression models for analysis, which are statistical methods rather than machine learning approaches."
