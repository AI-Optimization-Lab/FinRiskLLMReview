    "reason": "The paper focuses on developing a new risk measurement method for China's carbon market using a combined model (GARCH-SSAEPD-GA-VaR) that involves generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), standardized standard asymmetric exponential power distribution (SSAEPD), genetic algorithm (GA), and value at risk (VaR). The study does not mention or utilize any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies listed in the keywords. Instead, it employs statistical and optimization methods specific to financial risk measurement."
