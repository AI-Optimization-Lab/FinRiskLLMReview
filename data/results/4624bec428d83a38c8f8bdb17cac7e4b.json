    "reason": "The paper focuses on the uncertainty in annual energy production (AEP) calculations for wind power plants, specifically examining correlations between different uncertainty components. It uses a Monte Carlo approach and statistical analysis but does not mention or involve any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies. The study is grounded in statistical and operational analysis rather than machine learning or artificial intelligence."
