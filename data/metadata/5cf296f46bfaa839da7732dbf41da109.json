  "title": "Enhancing patent retrieval using text and knowledge graph embeddings: a technical note",
  "abstract": "Patent retrieval influences several applications within engineering design research, education, and practice as well as applications that concern innovation, intellectual property, and knowledge management etc. In this article, we propose a method to retrieve patents relevant to an initial set of patents, by synthesising state-of-the-art techniques among natural language processing and knowledge graph embedding. Our method involves a patent embedding approach that captures text, citation, and inventor information, which individually represent different facets of knowledge communicated through a patent document. We obtain text embeddings through Sentence-BERT applied to titles and abstracts. We obtain citation and inventor embeddings through TransE that is trained using the corresponding knowledge graphs. We identify using a classification task that the concatenation of text, citation, and inventor embeddings offers a plausible representation of a patent. While the proposed patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target patent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilised to rank all target patents and retrieve the most relevant ones. We apply the proposed patent retrieval method to a set of patents corresponding to a product family and an inventor's portfolio.",
