  "title": "An approach to the relationship between the information about Spanish financial entities' social responsibility with respect to customers and their own corporate reputation",
  "abstract": "This paper presents an explanatory regression model contrasting the existence of a direct relationship between the information concerning the social responsibility of Spanish financial entities with respect to their customers and their corporate reputation. The dependent variable of the model is an ordinal variable defined by its position in the MERCO ranking of the entities under study; the ordinal regression model is the methodology applied. The model we present constitutes a first approach to ascertain the importance that information on social responsibility has in managing corporate reputation. This aspect of management will gradually become just as important as knowledge or added value management is today. The results obtained show a direct relationship between the category of corporate reputation and the information about innovation and risk management communicated by the financial entities.
