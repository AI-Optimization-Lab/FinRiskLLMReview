  "title": "Free banking theory: literature review and relevance to the regulation of cryptocurrencies debate",
  "abstract": "PurposeFree banking theory, as developed in Adam Smith's 1776 treatise, The Wealth of Nations is a useful tool in determining the extent to which the invisible hand of the market should prevail in regulatory policy. The purpose of this study is to provide a timely review of the literature, evaluating the theory's relevance to regulation of financial technology generally and cryptocurrencies (cryptos) specifically.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology is qualitative, applying free banking theory as developed in the literature to technology-defined environments. Recent legislative developments in the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the UK, European Union and the USA, are drawn upon.FindingsParticipants in volatile cryptocurrency markets should bear the consequences of inadvisable investments in accordance with free banking theory. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which these are traded militate against coordinated oversight by central banks, supporting a qualified free banking approach. Differences regarding statutory definitions of cryptos as units of exchange, tokens or investment securities and the propensity of these to transition between categories across the business cycle render attempts at concerted classification at the international level problematic. Prevention of criminality through extension of Suspicious Activity Reporting to exchanges and intermediaries should be the principal objective of policymakers, rather than definitions of evolving products that risk stifling technological innovation.Originality/valueThe study proposes that instead of a traditional regulatory approach to cryptos, which emphasises holders' safety and compensation, a free banking approach combined with a focus on criminality would be a more effective and pragmatic way forward.",
