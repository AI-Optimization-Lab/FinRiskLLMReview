  "title": "Connection Between Poker Playing and Problem Gambling with Sociodemographic Factors and Other Gambling Activities",
  "abstract": "Many variables predisposing to gambling and problem gambling are already known. Yet, little is still known about the factors associated with poker, which is one of the most popular and the fastest growing areas of gambling, especially among young people. The aim of our study was to identify the relationship of selected sociodemographic factors with playing poker and problematic gambling. The other gambling activities was also included. The results of the regression analysis demonstrated that the following variables were connected with playing poker: place of residence (p < 0.001), mother's education (p = 0.004) and that of father (p = 0.046), material status, both of family of origin and current, and financial independence (p < 0.001). The risk of problem gambling is higher in case of players with low assessment of their own current material status (p = 0.028) and those who are financially dependent (p = 0.046). The risk level of problem gambling is also associated with the poker players' involvement in: slot machine games, sports betting, Totalizator Sportowy (Lotto) games, casino games (for all variables, the significance level is p < 0.001). The acquired data helped us to identify the groups most exposed to playing poker and excessive involvement in the game and may contribute to the development of appropriate prevention programs to protect persons belonging to the risk group.",
