  "title": "Chronic Absenteeism: Risks and Protective Factors Among Low-Income, Minority Children and Adolescents",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Low-income and racial/ethnic minority students often face distinct challenges in attending school eading to lower academic performance, low graduation rates, and overall, an indicator of diminished long-term social and financial stability. Chronic absenteeism is a national problem and to address this, a better understanding of risks and points of intervention for the students most at risk is needed. This cross-sectional study sought to assess risks and protective factors associated with chronic absenteeism in a predominantly low-income minority school district in Southern. METHODS Conducted in southern California, students (N = 24,439) ages 9 to 21 years were recruited. A logistic regression was used to assess the role poor physical and mental health, safety, bullying, and family risk factors attributed to chronic absenteeism. RESULTS Results revealed that asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, p < .001), being overweight/obese (OR = 1.38, p < .01), presence of family risk factors (OR = 1.49, p < .001), bullying (OR = 0.84, p < .05) and perceptions of safety at school (OR = 1.24, p < .05) increased the odds of chronic absenteeism, while protective factors such as support (OR = 1.30, p < .001), increased sleep (OR = 0.96, p < .001) and positive growth mindset (OR = 0.96, p < .001), mitigated it. CONCLUSION This study not only identifies risk but protective factors worth adhering to, to promote school attendance. Future research should further examine the role of mental health in chronic absenteeism.",
