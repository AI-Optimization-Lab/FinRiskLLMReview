  "title": "Portfolio optimization based on the pre-selection of stocks by the Support Vector Machine model",
  "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the performance of an investment portfolio using the Markowitz model, which maximizes the Sharpe ratio from a set of assets preselected through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using fundamental indicators in the Brazilian stock market. With an accuracy of 61% for the SVM model, the results indicate that preselecting assets based on fundamental indicators and subsequently optimizing them by maximizing the Sharpe ratio showed a superior return and faster recovery after drawdown periods compared to the benchmark or SVM (1/n) strategy. These results suggest the relevance of including the SVM in the optimization portfolio process.",
