  "title": "Unpacking High-Impact Practices in the Arts: Predictors of College, Career, and Community Engagement Outcomes",
  "abstract": "Research on high-impact practices (HIPs) demonstrates positive links to student learning and development, but generally does not focus on discipline-specific activities, such as working with an artist in the community and portfolio completion. This study seeks to identify beneficial HIPs for arts training through an analysis of 23,916 arts alumni from 77 postsecondary institutions. A series of regression models suggest that HIP participation was associated with gains in academic abilities and career skills, higher levels of college satisfaction, more successful job searches, greater likelihood of employment in the arts and avocational arts practice, and more frequent arts community involvement.",
