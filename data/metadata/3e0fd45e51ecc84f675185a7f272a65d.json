  "title": "Association of Financial Literacy and Risk Preference With Fraud Exposure and Victimization Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults in China",
  "abstract": "Fraud jeopardizes older people's physical, mental, and economic well-being, and financial literacy and risk preference have been linked to the risk of fraud experience. Given the inconsistent evidence, we investigated whether financial literacy and risk preferences were associated with fraud exposure and victimization among middle-aged and older adults. We analyzed data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey, including 22,121 participants aged 50 and older. Poisson regression models were conducted to determine the association of financial literacy and risk preference with fraud experience. We found that financial literacy and risk preference were positively associated with fraud exposure and victimization. The prevalence of fraud victimization among middle-aged and older adults with the highest financial literacy and risk preference levels was 46.5% and 45.8% higher than among those with the lowest levels, respectively. These findings suggested that basic financial knowledge is insufficient to protect older people from fraud exposure and victimization.",
