  "title": "Health and Financial Literacy and the Acquisition of COVID-19 Knowledge in Older Adults",
  "abstract": "Knowledge about COVID-19 enters into many aspects of decision making, especially for older people who are at increased risk of severe disease or death. Yet little is known about the resources that supported older people's uptake of COVID-19 knowledge. Here, we hypothesized that higher pre-pandemic health and financial literacy was associated with higher COVID-19 knowledge. Participants were 434 community-based older people without dementia. COVID-19 knowledge was assessed via a 5-item measure, and health and financial literacy was assessed via a 32-item measure. In an ordinal regression model adjusted for age, gender, and education, higher literacy was associated with higher COVID-19 knowledge (p < .0001), and this association persisted after further adjusting for robust measures of global cognition or one of five specific cognitive domains (all p's <= .0001). These findings suggest that literacy plays a key role in supporting older people's acquisition of impactful knowledge in the real world.",
