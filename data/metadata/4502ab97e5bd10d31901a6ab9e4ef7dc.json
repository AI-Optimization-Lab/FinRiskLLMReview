  "title": "Parameterized deep reinforcement learning-enabled maintenance decision-support and life-cycle risk assessment for highway bridge portfolios",
  "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged to be a promising alternative capable of providing intelligent and proactive sequential decision-support for bridge asset management. However, the state of research in this topic mainly focused on a fixed structural system, whereas the integration of DRL with varying training environments, which may more broadly accommodate the needs of different individual structures is yet to be explored. This study proposes a parameterized DRL framework to deliver a unified policy to meet the decision needs of different individual highway bridge structures within a bridge portfolio. Moreover, a time-and policy dependent risk quantification approach is also proposed. A case-study highway bridge portfolio is considered to evaluate and demonstrate the merit of the proposed methodology. From the results, the parameterized DRL policy is found to offer superior sequential maintenance decisions that can better help the bridge structures adapt to long-term deterioration, while minimizing the cumulative socioeconomic costs.",
