  "title": "The Role and Comparison of Stressful Life Events in Suicide and Suicide Attempt: A Descriptive-Analytical Study",
  "abstract": "Background: In recent years, suicide in Iran has become a growing concern. Although stressful life events (SLEs) are increasing as a global prevalence, suicide attempters (SAs) and the impact and association between suicide and SLEs are poorly understood. Objectives: This study aimed at examining the role and effect of SLEs in suicides and SAs. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed during 2014 to 2016 based on 186 records (through random quota sampling) of suicidal behaviors (SBs), including 154 SAs and 32 suicide cases in Malekan County, East Azerbaijan, Iran. A valid semistructured Life Event questionnaire (LEQ) with 43-items of common types of SLEs in the last year before SBs was used by trained interviewers through single sitting and face to face interviews. The point-biserial correlation and multiple logistic regression analysis were utilized to estimate the adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals for suicide risk. Results: A significant correlation was found between SLEs scores and suicide (R = 0.739). Comparing SLEs types between the two groups of SAs and suicides, it was revealed that the highest odds ratios were related to financial problems (OR = 11.9; 95% CI = 4.00 35.85), early marriage (OR = 4.97; 95% CI = 1.68 - 14.65), exposure to new conditions (OR = 8.79; 95% CI = 1.3 - 59.22), and family conflicts (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.23 - 6.53), respectively. Conclusions: SLEs are most strongly associated with committing suicide. Suicide determinants are different from SA. SLEs management by health systems is imperative to improve life skills in suicide prevention.",
