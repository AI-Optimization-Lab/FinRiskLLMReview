  "title": "The Case for Integrating ESG into Fixed-Income Portfolios",
  "abstract": "In this article we investigate the possible benefits of integrating ESG considerations into fixed-income portfolios. Our initial results indicated that such considerations could have a significant impact on portfolio returns. Our more formal use of regression analysis demon-strated that the impact on returns was negligible. The authors did find tentative evidence, however, to suggest that enhancing the ESG credentials of a portfolio can lead to a reduction in a portfolio's tail risk",
