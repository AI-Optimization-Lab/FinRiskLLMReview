  "title": "A machine learning efficient frontier",
  "abstract": "We propose a simple approach to bridge between portfolio theory and machine learning. The outcome is an out-of-sample machine learning efficient frontier based on two assets, high risk and low risk. By rotating between the two assets, we show that the proposed frontier dominates the mean-variance efficient frontier out-of-sample. Our results, therefore, shed important light on the appeal of machine learning into portfolio selection under estimation risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
