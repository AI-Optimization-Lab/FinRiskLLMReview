  "title": "Dynamic programming with NAR model versus Q-learning - Case study",
  "abstract": "Two approaches to control policy synthesis for unknown systems are investigated. An indirect approach is based on adaptive identification of a neural network model in the NAR form (nonlinear autoregresion model) followed by application of the dynamic programming to this model.. A direct approach consists of Q-learning with the use of a lookup table. Both methods were applied to optimization of a stock portfolio problem and tested on Warsaw Stock Exchange data.",
