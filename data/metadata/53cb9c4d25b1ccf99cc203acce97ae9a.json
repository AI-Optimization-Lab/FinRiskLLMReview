Finally cross sectional regression used to find out the impact of selected demographic variables on investment motives i.e Safety & Growth of funds and specific future planning. Findings-It is found Safety & Growth of funds and specific future planning are two significant investment motives of the working females and both the investment motives significantly explained by the level of education and awareness of financial products.

It also pinpoints the impact of demographics on investment motives.",
