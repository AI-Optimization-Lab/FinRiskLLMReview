  "title": "Long-Term Determinants of Depression Mood: A 19-Year Follow Up of 2344 Middle-Aged and Older Adults",
  "abstract": "Objectives: This study explores depression changes and influencing factors in middle-aged and older individuals, focusing on different cognitive function states. Methods: This cohort study uses panel data from seven waves of the nationally representative Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (1996-2015) with 2344 participants aged 50 or above. Data analysis was conducted from 25 January 2023 to 4 May 2023. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyzed three trajectories: maintained mood, progressive depression, and consistent depression. Protective factors for progressive depression included self-health perception, exercise, family satisfaction, and financial well being, while risk factors were chronic diseases, pain, substance use, and daily activity limitations. Cognitive function emerged as a significant protective factor, while pain exhibited the highest risk. In the cognitive dysfunction group, only social participation showed notable differences. Conclusion: Progressive and consistent depression in middle-aged and older people have aroused concern. In addition to necessary protection and risk factors, special attention should be paid to the risks posed by the level of pain. Addressing pain as a crucial risk factor is essential, particularly for middle-aged and older people with cognitive impairment and depression, necessitating targeted support.",
