  "title": "Database comments on Telegram channels related to cryptocurrencies with sentiments",
  "abstract": "Objectives Due to the limitations of Twitter, the expansion of Telegram channels, and the Telegram API's easy use, Telegram comments have become prevalent. Telegram is one of the most popular social networks, unlike Twitter, which has no restrictions on sending messages, and experts can share their opinions and media. Some of these channels, managed by influencers of large companies, are very influential in the behavior of the market on various stocks, including cryptocurrencies. In this research, the opinion collection of 10 famous Telegram channels regarding the analysis of cryptocurrencies has been extracted. The sentiments of these opinions have been analyzed using the HDRB model. HDRB is a hybrid model of RoBERTa deep neural network, BiGRU, and attention layer used for sentiment analysis (SA). Analyzing the sentiments of these opinions is very important for understanding the future behavior of the market and managing the stock portfolio. The opinions of this dataset, published by experts in the field of cryptocurrencies, are precious, unlike the opinions that are extracted only by using the hashtag of the names of cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, the dataset related to cryptocurrencies, which has the opinions of experts and the polarity of their feelings, is very rare.Data description The dataset of this research is the sentiments of more than ten popular Telegram channels regarding a wide range of cryptocurrencies. These comments were collected through the Telegram API from December 2023 to March 2024. This data set contains an Excel file containing the text of the comments, the date of comment creation, the number of views, the compound score, the sentiment score, and the type of sentiment polarity. These opinions cover influencer analysis on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Also, two Word files, one containing the description of the dataset columns and the other Python code for extracting comments from Telegram channels, are included in this dataset.",
