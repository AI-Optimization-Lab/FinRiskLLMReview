  "title": "Financial Toxicity Among Women with Breast Cancer Varies by Age and Race",
  "abstract": "Introduction. Financial toxicity negatively affects clinical outcomes in breast cancer. Underrepresented demographics may be at higher risk for financial toxicity. We characterized disparities on the basis of age and other factors. Patients and Methods. Surveys completed by women with stage 0-IV breast cancer treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 06/2022 and 05/2023 were analyzed. The comprehensive score for financial toxicity (COST) scale was used to assess financial toxicity. Descriptive statistics were calculated for differences in financial toxicity/related factors, and outcomes by age and race. Associations between variables of interest and COST scores were analyzed using linear regression. Results. Of 8512 respondents (75% white, 9.3% Asian, 8.4% Black), most (68%) had clinical stage 0/I disease. Stratified by age, young Black women had higher financial toxicity than young white or Asian women (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, women age < 45 years experienced higher financial toxicity than older women (coefficient - 2.0, 95% CI - 2.8 to - 1.1, p < 0.001). Compared with white women, financial toxicity was greater among Black (coefficient - 6.8, 95% CI - 7.8 to - 5.8) and Asian women (coefficient - 3.5, 95% CI - 4.4 to - 2.5). Cost-related medication non-adherence was more frequent among Black and Asian women (p < 0.001). Asian women more often paid for treatment with savings than white and Black women (p < 0.001). Young women reported using savings for treatment-related costs more than older (45% vs. 32%); p < 0.001). Conclusions. Racial minorities and young patients are disproportionately affected by financial toxicity. Further studies are planned to determine how financial toxicity evolves over time and whether referral to financial services effectively reduces toxicity.",
