  "title": "The materials that make an energy company: BP chief scientist Ellen Williams discusses sustainable energy",
  "abstract": "After over three decades in academia, Ellen Williams left her position as a Distinguished University Professor of physics at the University of Maryland to take on the role of Chief Scientist at BP in January 2010. Williams is responsible for keeping a pulse on science and technology developments that could advance BP's energy portfolio and serves as a liaison to the company's university partners. She provides assurance for research and development spending and strategic scientific advice to BP senior executives. She has been instrumental in developing the BP International Center for Advanced Materials (ICAM) that will initially fund research at three UK-based universities and one US university. The center's research foci encompass materials integrity to advance corrosion protection during operations as well as the development of stronger, lighter materials for use in the challenging environments of hydrocarbon production and processing.",
