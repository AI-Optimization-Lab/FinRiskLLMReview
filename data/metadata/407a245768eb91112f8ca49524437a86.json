  "title": "Systemically important financial institutions in China: from view of tail risk spillover network",
  "abstract": "The investigation of the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) plays a key role in coping with systemic risk. We first adopt the GARCH-Copula-CoVaR model to establish tail risk spillover networks of China's financial institutions. We then employ the systemic risk emitters (SRE) and receivers (SRR) to measure the SIFIs. Finally, we utilize the panel data regression model to analyse the determinants of the rank of SRE and SRR. We find that state-owned banks and large insurance companies show systemic importance, while some commercial banks are also SIFIs due to their high value of SRR. Furthermore, the growth rate of total assets, leverage, nonperforming loans, price-earnings ratio and firm size are the common factors that affect the SIFIs.",
