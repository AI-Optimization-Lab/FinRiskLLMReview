  "title": "Project portfolio selection using multiple criteria decision tree",
  "abstract": "Project portfolio selection is a classical example of a dynamic multiple criteria decision making problem under risk. Decision tree is a useful tool to formulate and solve such problem. Although a lot of efforts have been done to propose procedures for identifying efficient solutions of such problems, relatively little work is dedicated to final solution identification. In the paper a new procedure for a project portfolio selection problem is proposed. Our technique takes into account multiple criteria, risk and dynamics that characterize such problems. We use decision tree and interactive procedure for identifying the optimal strategy.",
