  "title": "A Comparative Review of Advanced Techniques for Financial Sentiment Analysis",
  "abstract": "Financial sentiment analysis, the task of discerning market sentiment from financial texts, plays a crucial role in investment decisions, risk assessment, and understanding economic trends. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques have often faced limitations in handling the complexities and nuances of financial language. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought a paradigm shift in this field. With their remarkable ability to process and understand natural language, LLMs are enabling new approaches that increase the accuracy and sophistication of financial sentiment analysis. This paper provides a comparative overview of cutting-edge LLM-based techniques for financial sentiment analysis. We introduce a six-pronged classification framework covering data types, sentiment granularity, model architectures, training approaches, methodological focus, and evaluation metrics. This framework aims to provide a structured perspective for understanding recent research trends. Our analysis reveals several key developments in the field. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with advanced techniques, like Instruction-tuning approaches and Retrieval-augmented methods. While LLMs offer clear advantages, ensuring data quality, mitigating bias, enhancing model explainability, and scaling these models to real-world applications remain active research areas. This review offers investors and financial researchers a comprehensive guide to the evolving landscape of financial sentiment analysis, facilitating well-informed choices for different use cases and laying the groundwork for future research.",
