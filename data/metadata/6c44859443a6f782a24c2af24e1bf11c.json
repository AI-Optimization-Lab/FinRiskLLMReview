  "title": "Artificial Intelligence Model for Risk Management in Healthcare Institutions: Towards Sustainable Development",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes an artificial intelligence model to manage risks in healthcare institutions. This model uses a trendy data source, social media, and employs users' interactions to identify and assess potential risks. It employs natural language processing techniques to analyze the tweets of users and produce vivid insights into the types of risk and their magnitude. In addition, some big data analysis techniques, such as classification, are utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the data and manage the data effectively. The produced insights will help healthcare managers to make the best decisions for their institutions and patients, which can lead to a more sustainable environment. In addition, we build a mathematical model for the proposed model, and some closed-form relations for risk analysis, identification and assessment are derived. Moreover, a case study on the CVS institute of healthcare in the USA, and our subsequent findings, indicate that a quartile of patients' tweets refer to risks in CVS services, such as operational, financial and technological risks, and the magnitude of these risks vary between high risk (19%), medium risk (80.4%) and low risk (0.6%). Further, several performance measures and a complexity analysis are given to show the validity of the proposed model.",
