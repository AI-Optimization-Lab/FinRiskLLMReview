  "title": "DO EU STOCK MARKETS BEHAVE LIKE GLOBAL STOCK MARKET?",
  "abstract": "The paper explains the dynamics of the main European market indices across quantiles during analysed period from January, 4, 2000 to November, 11, 2016. We analyse the dependence structure between European stock markets and influential global markets: the S&P 500 index, the RUSSELL 1000 market index, the Shanghai A-Share Stock Price Index SHASHR, the stock market uncertainty VIX and spot exchange rate of gold in USD using quantile regression approach. Our results show that EU stock markets exhibit asymmetric dependence with the Russian stock markets. S&P 500 returns move in the opposite direction to the analysed European stock markets. The Chinese market has a statistically significant effect on the analysed markets especially during bear markets. As the only influences the examined markets show across the entire quantiles except quantiles 95% and 99%. The stock market uncertainty (VIX) has a significant negative weak influence across selected analysed quantiles. Our findings may have implications for international investors in terms of risk management, which should vary according to changes in global financial markets.",
