  "title": "User-adaptable Natural Language Generation for Regression Testing within the Finance Domain",
  "abstract": "Reporting duties and regression testing within the financial industry produce huge amounts of data which has to be sighted and analyzed by experts. This time-consuming and expensive process does not fit to modern, agile software developing practices with fast update cycles. In this paper, we present a user-adaptable natural language generation system that supports financial experts from the insurance industry in analysing the results from regression tests for Solvency II risk calculations and evaluate it with a group of experts.",
