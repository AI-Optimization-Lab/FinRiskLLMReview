  "abstract": "Objective: To assess risk factors and factors associated with nonachievement of the treatment target levels among 75-year-old Finns with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient. Subjects: Seventy-five-year-old participants of the Turku Senior Health Clinic Study (N = 1296) with T2D (n = 247). Main outcome measures: Nonachievement of fasting blood glucose (FBG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and blood pressure (BP) levels set by the national treatment guidelines. Results: Nonachievement rates of FBG, BP and LDL-C were 47%, 85%, and 47%, respectively. Non-usage of T2D medication was negatively (adjusted OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.88) and central obesity positively (1.88, 1.09-3.24) related to nonachievement of FBG target level; alcohol use was positively (3.71, 1.04-13.16) and decreased selfrated health negatively (0.34, 0.12-0.97) related to the nonachievement of BP target level. Nonachievement of LDL-C target level was positively related to poor financial status (3.50, 1.19-10.28) and non-use of lipid-lowering medication (7.70, 4.07-14.56). Conclusions: Nonachievement rates of the national treatment goals were high among older T2D patients, and nonachievement was related to use of medication, obesity, alcohol use, poor health, and poor financial status. We emphasize the importance of customized target setting by risk factor levels and active treatment.",
