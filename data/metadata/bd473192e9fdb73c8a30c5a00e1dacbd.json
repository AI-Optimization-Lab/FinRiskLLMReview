  "title": "Credit risk assessment in commercial banks based on multi-layer SVM classifier",
  "abstract": "According to the analysis of credit risk assessment in commercial banks, a set of index system is established. The index system combines financial factors with non-financial factors for credit risk assessment. The credit rating is separated into five classes-normality, attention, sublevel, doubt and loss. To classify the credit risks of five classes, a multi-layer support vector machines (SVM) classifier is established to assess the credit risk. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, a real case is given and BP neural network is also used to assess the same data. The experiment results show that multi-layer SVM classifier is effective in credit risk assessment and achieves better performance than BP neural network.",
