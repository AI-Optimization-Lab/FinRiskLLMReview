  "title": "A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Prevalence and Risk Factors for Prenatal Depression in Spain and Mexico",
  "abstract": "The prevalence and risk factors associated with prenatal depression among Spanish-speaking women in Spain and Mexico are examined and compared through a cross-cultural study. The study utilizes secondary data from 563 participants who received prenatal care in Madrid (N = 283) and in Mexico City (N = 280), assessed with the PHQ-9 and the PDPI-R. Spanish women reported a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (10.0%) than Mexican women (20.3%). Regression analyses showed that previous prenatal anxiety and lack of family emotional support were common risk factors to the two countries. Within each country, significant risk factors included: (a) previous depression history (beta = 0.224; p < 0.001) in Spain; and (b) unplanned pregnancy (beta = - 0.116; p < 0.027), lack of emotional support from others (beta = 0.129; p < 0.032), marital dissatisfaction (beta = 0.186; p < 0.009), and life stress due to financial problems (beta = 0.117; p < 0.026), and life stress due to marital problems (beta = 0.114; p < 0.040) in Mexico. Health professionals can tailor interventions to their particular risk factors to reduce the adverse effects on mothers and infants.",
