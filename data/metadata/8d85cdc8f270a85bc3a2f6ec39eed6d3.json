  "title": "Does size matter? Entrepreneurial orientation and performance in Spanish sports firms",
  "abstract": "The entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of firms is the subject of current research in the fields of management and business. However, analyses on this subject in sport companies are lacking. This study analyzes the relationship among EO, firm size, and business performance of Spanish sports service firms. The study analyzes EO as a multidimensional construct (with proactiveness, innovation, and risk-taking dimensions), and business performance considering, self-perception (perceived customer satisfaction, perceived market effectiveness, and perceived financial performance) and financial indicators (ROI). The firm size follows the EU's directive for the classification of micro, small, medium, and large firms. The results from a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis show that EO is a sufficient condition for performance in small Spanish sports service companies but not in large firms.
