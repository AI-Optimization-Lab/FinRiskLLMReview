  "abstract": "We construct an empirical heterogeneous agent model which optimally combines forecasts from fundamentalist and chartist agents and evaluates its out-of-sample forecast performance using daily data covering an overall period from January 1999 to June 2014 for six of the most widely traded currencies. We use daily financial data such as level, slope and curvature yield curve factors, equity prices, as well as risk aversion and global trade activity measures in the fundamentalist agent's predictor set to obtain a proxy for the market's view on the state of the macroeconomy. Chartist agents rely upon standard momentum, moving average and relative strength index technical indicators in their predictor set. Individual agent specific forecasts are constructed using a flexible dynamic model averaging framework and are then aggregated into a model combined forecast using a forecast combination regression. We show that our empirical heterogeneous agent model produces statistically significant and economically sizeable forecast improvements over a random walk benchmark. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
