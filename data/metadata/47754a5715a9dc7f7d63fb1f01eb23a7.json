  "title": "Psychoeconomic Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the General Population in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study",
  "abstract": "Objective:To explore the psychological and economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic and identify those at higher risk of suffering financial consequences. Methods:A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between June 27 and September 27, 2020. Logistic regression was conducted to determine who was more likely to suffer financially from the COVID-19 epidemic. Results:A total of 440 individual participated in this study, of whom, 86.8% were aged 19 - 49 years, and 60.0% were females. Around 57.0% reported that they have been affected economically by the pandemic. Around 11.0% of the participants reported that they feel anxious; around 18.0% reported feeling depressed or fearful because of COVID-19. Males were around twice (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.24 - 2.72) as likely to be affected economically during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < 0.01). Saudis were 59.0% less likely to be affected (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.27 - 0.60; P < 0.001). Conclusions:The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological and economic status of individuals in Saudi Arabia deeply. To prevent long-term psychological and economic deterioration and to hasten social recovery, mental, financial, supportive strategies, and programs to aid the entire community in coping with the pandemic are recommended.",
