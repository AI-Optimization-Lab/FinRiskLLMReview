  "title": "Neural network expression rates and applications of the deep parametric PDE method in counterparty credit risk",
  "abstract": "The recently introduced deep parametric PDE method combines the efficiency of deep learning for high-dimensional problems with the reliability of classical PDE models. The accuracy of the deep parametric PDE method is determined by the best-approximation property of neural networks. We provide (to the best of our knowledge) the first approximation results, which feature a dimension-independent rate of convergence for deep neural networks with a hyperbolic tangent as the activation function. Numerical results confirm that the deep parametric PDE method performs well in high-dimensional settings by presenting in a risk management problem of high interest for the financial industry.",
