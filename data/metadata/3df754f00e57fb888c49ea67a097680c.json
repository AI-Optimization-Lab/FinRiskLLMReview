  "title": "Stock selection based on financial ratios on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Analysis between 2001 and 2010",
  "abstract": "The process of a portfolio optimisation is preceded by a stock selection. The article is concentrated on using the synthetic measure of development in the stock selection. The synthetic measure of development proposed by Hellwig (Hellwig, 1968) is one of the methods of linear arrangement. It enables the classification of companies in relation to the set variables, that are financial ratios. The purpose of the article is to study if one of five quantile portfolios is systematically giving higher rate of return than the benchmark portfolio. Companies are chosen to quantile portfolios due to their position in the ranking that is constructed on the base of the synthetic measure of development. The synthetic measure of development is computed using the financial ratios. The author uses data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2010. The rankings and portfolios are built separately for each year. As a result, it can be stated that the second portfolio of the ranking systematically gives higher rate of return than a benchmark portfolio.",
