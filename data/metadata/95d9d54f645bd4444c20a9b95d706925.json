  "title": "Financial distress and jump tail risk: Evidence from China?s listed companies",
  "abstract": "The imperfect delisting system is a big barrier for Chinese listed companies to obtain efficient bankruptcy applications. We redefine financial distress and take a closer look at how jump tail risk can aggravate the possibility of financial distress. Empirical analysis shows: a logistic model involving jump tail risk can predict the possibility of financial distress well; portfolio analysis and Fama-MacBeth regression confirm that jump tail risk may contribute to the low return for dis-tressed stocks, verifying the so-called financial distress puzzle in China. Further, the mechanism analysis demonstrates that analyst coverage and investor sentiment are potential resources for financial distress. This study provides a more practical measure to estimate and investigate the financial distress anomaly in China.",
