  "title": "RESEARCH ON THE REGULATING EFFECT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ON CORPORATE PERFORMANCE AND CORPORATE RISK BASED ON ECOSYSTEM VIEW",
  "abstract": "Ecosystem theory can be applied to corporate governance to help analyze and interpret some of the issues in business development and management. A company can be used as a small ecosystem, and corporate governance is its nerve center. Studies have shown that good corporate governance can improve business performance while reducing corporate risk. However, there are few studies on the combined effects of corporate governance on company performance and corporate risk. Under the guidance of ecosystem theory, this paper studies the adjustment effect of corporate governance on corporate performance and corporate risk by establishing corporate governance evaluation index system and regression analysis. The empirical results show that during the global financial turmoil, corporate governance has a regulatory effect on corporate performance and corporate risk, and can serve as a buffer for corporate risk. However, after the global financial crisis, corporate governance has little to do with corporate performance and corporate risk.",
