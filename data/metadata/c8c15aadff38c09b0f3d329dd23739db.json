  "title": "RETRACTED: Deep Learning-Driven Financial Management Innovation Upgrade for Universities (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "This study aims to improve the quality of college financial management and reduce the risk of college financial management, and a college financial system based on multiscale deep learning is designed in this paper. This paper designs a university financial system based on multiscale deep learning. In the hardware design, the system adds multiple sensors and scans all the information in the financial database using a coordinator. In the software design, the weights that can connect the financial information of the same attribute are set by establishing a database form; according to the multilayer perceptual network topology, a full interconnection model based on multiscale deep learning is designed to realize the system's deep extraction of data. The experimental results show that the financial risk is based on the risk warning capability for university finance, and compared with the system under the traditional design, the university finance system designed at this time has the most categories of financial information parameters extracted.",
