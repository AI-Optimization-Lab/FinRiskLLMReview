  "title": "R&D Intensity and the Value of Analysts' Recommendations*",
  "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between the value of financial analysts' recommendations and the intensity of firms' research and development (R& D) expenditures. We conduct univariate, portfolio, and regression analyses using a sample of 8,620 public firms for the period 1993-2004. The empirical results reveal that the value of analysts' recommendations is significantly greater for firms that are more heavily invested in R& D. In addition, we investigate factors that contribute to the value of analysts' recommendations. We find that analysts with advanced degrees (e. g., Ph. D., M. D.), more firm-specific experience, and greater industry expertise issue more valuable recommendations, particularly for R& D-intensive firms. Our findings shed light on the important issue of how informed market participants' activities expedite the price discovery process of R& D firms. Prior research shows that, despite the absence of mandatory financial reporting on R& D, investors incorporate information on the value and productivity of R& D investments into share prices. Our study suggests that analyst recommendations serve as an important channel through which information on the value and productivity of R& D projects becomes impounded into security prices.",
