  "title": "Beyond the Tailbone: A Family's Journey Through Caudal Regression Syndrome- A Triple Sibship",
  "abstract": "Background: Caudal regression syndrome (CRS), also known as caudal agenesis, results from abnormal development of the caudal aspect of the spinal cord and vertebral column due to an earlier abnormality of gastrulation. Results: This report showcases a unique scenario where three siblings, devoid of any prior family history or identifiable risk factors, exhibit symptoms of CRS and receive care at a government-run tertiary facility dedicated to children's health. In establishing a concrete diagnosis, we relied on skeletal surveys, comprehensive symptom evaluation, and medical history assessment. Additionally, we recommended further investigation through magnetic resonance imaging and genetic testing to attain a more in-depth understanding and confirmation of the condition. Unfortunately, the financial constraints faced by the parents led to the unfeasibility of pursuing these advanced diagnostic options. Given the rarity of this syndrome and the limited existing literature, our report is a significant contribution. It marks the first comprehensive exploration of CRS from the genetic and familial predisposition perspective, shedding new light on this rare condition. Conclusion: This case series pioneers our understanding of the familial and genetic connections between CRS and sacral agenesis. Strikingly, each subsequent generation has experienced more severe manifestations earlier, furnishing compelling evidence that underpins the genetic predisposition to CRS. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.
