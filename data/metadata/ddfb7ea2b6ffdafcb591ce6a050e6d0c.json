  "title": "Demography factors, financial risk tolerance, and retail investors",
  "abstract": "This study aims to understand the influence of demography factors, as an independent variable to the financial risk tolerance of retail investors who conduct stock investment transactions on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, as a dependent variable. The research used a quantitative approach to binary logistic regression analysis model and online questionnaire method for the data collection. The questionnaires were distributed through online media and communication tools, including the mailing list and social media. The number of observed respondents which met the criteria were about 162 respondents. Then, the parametric study showed a significant positive partial effect from the independent variable, income, against dependent variable financial risk tolerance. The other independent variables consisted of gender, age, marital status, education, and occupation; did not exhibit any significant impact on financial risk tolerance.",
