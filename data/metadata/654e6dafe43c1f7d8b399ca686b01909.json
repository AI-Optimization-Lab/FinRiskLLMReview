  "title": "The Trainee Year: the forming of a teacher's personality and their approach to work",
  "abstract": "The Trainee Year (TY) is a project focusing on issues in pregradual training of a teacher and the influence of the pregradual training on the development of the teacher's personality. With regards to the form of the research, it builds on the design portfolio of Action Research. The qualitative methodology according to Jack Whitehead (1986) and Jean McNiff (2006), The Living Theory Approach, has been chosen. In addition, this methodology is being used in parallel with the application of biography design techniques. More specifically, authobiographic evidence on a diary basis is being used. The data collection procedure is supported with the use of modern recording devices (digital voice recorder, camcorder). This allows more accurate evaluation in the self-reflection process, which is at the heart of the reflection cycle. The assets of the practise, using the surveillance of changes which are happening in the personality of the trainee teacher preparing for the teacher's role and the forming of their approach to teaching, are then evaluated from the trainee teacher's point of view. In addition to the trainee's self-reflection and evaluation, the factors being observed include the influence of the work atmosphere, the working conditions, the socialisation of the trainee teacher into the team and last but not least the relationship of the trainee with his/her supervising teacher and their professional skills. In the initial research phase which took six weeks, the trainee observed other teachers in the field. The role of the trainee teacher was to evaluate their performance according to the competence classification. The role of the observer has recently changed to the active teaching role. This will allow performing the evaluation of the functionality of the selected models and will enable analyzing and discussing the differences between the results achieved by the trainee and by the supervising teacher. The mentor role of the supervising teacher, who becomes an observer and evaluator of the trainee, forms an important factor contributing to the triangulation and validation of the data.",
