  "title": "Hospital readmissions after robotic hepatectomy for neoplastic disease: Analysis of risk factors, survival, and economical impact. A logistical regression and propensity score matched study",
  "abstract": "Background: As the first comprehensive investigation into hospital readmissions following robotic hepatectomy for neoplastic disease, this study aims to fill a critical knowledge gap by evaluating risk factors associated with readmission and their impact on survival and the financial burden. Methods: The study analyzed a database of robotic hepatectomy patients, comparing readmitted and non-readmitted individuals post-operatively using 1:1 propensity score matching. Statistical methods included Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, T-test, binomial logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Among 244 patients, 44 were readmitted within 90 days. Risk factors included hypertension (p = 0.01), increased Child-Pugh score (p < 0.01), and R1 margin status (p = 0.05). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlated with lower readmission risk (p = 0.045). Readmissions didn't significantly impact five-year survival (p = 0.42) but increased fixed indirect hospital costs (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Readmission post-robotic hepatectomy correlates with hypertension, higher Child-Pugh scores, and R1 margins. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a lower admission rate due to less diffuse liver disease in these patients. While not affecting survival, readmissions elevate healthcare costs.",
