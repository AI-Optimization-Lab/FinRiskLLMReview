  "title": "Major Risk Factors for Mortality in Elderly and Non-Elderly Adult Patients Emergently Admitted for Blunt Chest Wall Trauma: Hospital Length of Stay as an Independent Predictor",
  "abstract": "Background: Blunt thoracic trauma is responsible for 35% of trauma-related deaths in the United States and significantly contributes to morbidity and healthcare-related financial strain. The goal of this study was to evaluate factors influencing mortality in patients emergently admitted with the primary diagnosis of blunt chest wall trauma. Methods: Adults emergently admitted for blunt chest trauma were assessed using the National Inpatient Sample Database, 2004-2014. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were collected. Relationships were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: In total, 1120 adult and 1038 elderly patients emergently admitted with blunt chest trauma were assessed; 46.3% were female, and 53.6% were male. The average ages of adult and elderly patients were 46.6 and 78.9 years, respectively. Elderly and adult patients both displayed mortality rates of 1%. The regression model showed HLOS and several comorbidities as the main risk factors of mortality Every additional day of hospitalization increased the odds of mortality by 9% (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.18, p = 0.033). Mortality and liver disease were significantly associated (OR = 8.36, 95% CI = 2.23-31.37, p = 0.002). Respiratory disease and mortality rates demonstrated robust correlations (OR = 7.46, 95% CI = 1.63-34.11, p = 0.010). Trauma, burns, and poisons were associated with increased mortality (OR = 3.72, 95% CI = 1.18-11.71, p = 0.025). The presence of platelet/white blood cell disease correlated to higher mortality. (OR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.09-17.91, p = 0.038).",
