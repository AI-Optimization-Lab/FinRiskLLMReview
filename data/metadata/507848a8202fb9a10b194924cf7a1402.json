  "title": "Macroeconomic Determinants of Bad Loans in Baltic Countries and Romania",
  "abstract": "The current crisis has raised debates concerning the determinants of financial vulnerability. Among these, bad loans have been identified as significantly influencing financial imbalances. After a decade in which borrowing has constantly grown mainly because of the deregulation of financial markets, the crisis highlighted the importance of an effective credit risk management. The purpose of the paper is to study the evolution of bad loans ratio in relation with selected macroeconomic indicators in the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and Romania. The study was based on simple linear regression state, having bad loans as determine variable and macroeconomic determinants as determinant variables. Econometric analysis was correlated with qualitative analysis of the evolution of the indicators included in the study. The results confirm a significant influence of GDP and unemployment rate on non-performing loans in the Baltic countries as well as in Romania case.",
