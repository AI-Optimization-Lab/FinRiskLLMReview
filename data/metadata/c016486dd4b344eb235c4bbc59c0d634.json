  "title": "The relations between macroeconomic factors and the credit risk of commercial banks-empirical tests in China",
  "abstract": "The significance of credit risk of banks has been increasingly recognized in recent decades. This paper undertakes a macroanalysis of the credit risk of commercial banks in China during 2003-2011. Using mutual linear regression model, the paper studies the influence of macroeconomic factors on the credit risk of commercial banks-the financial stability indicator of banks measured by the non-performing loan ratio. Then the feedback effect of the credit risk is confirmed by Granger test of causality. Based on the results, several policy implications are proposed.",
