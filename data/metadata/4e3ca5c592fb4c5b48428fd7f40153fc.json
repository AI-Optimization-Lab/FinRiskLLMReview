  "title": "A note on Steuer and Utz's (2023) multi-objective optimization approach for generating sustainability-efficient fronts",
  "abstract": "Motivated by the increasing importance of sustainability in investing, Steuer and Utz (2023) propose a new approach for integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores into the portfolio selection process. These authors claim that their multi-objective portfolio optimization problem always provides mean-variance-ESG-efficient solutions because it belongs to the class of epsilon-constraint problems. Contending that this classification is problematic, we show that the developed approach cannot guarantee efficient portfolios.",
