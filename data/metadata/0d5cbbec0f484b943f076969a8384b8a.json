  "title": "A system for efficient portfolio management",
  "abstract": "In this work we perform an automatic data survey to draw up an optimum portfolio, and to automate the one year forecast of a portfolio's payoff and risk, showing the advantages of using formally grounded models in portfolio management and adopting a strategy that ensures, a high rate of return at a minimum risk. The use of neural networks provides an interesting alternative to the statistical classifier. We can take a decision on the purchase or sale of a given asset, using a neural network to classify the process into three decisions: buy, sell or do nothing.",
