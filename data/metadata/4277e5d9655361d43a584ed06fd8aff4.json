  "title": "Does geopolitical risk matter for global asset returns? Evidence from quantile-on-quantile regression",
  "abstract": "We investigate the impact of geopolitical risk (GPR) generated by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on European and Russian bonds, equity, and global commodity markets. We employ the GPR index and apply the quantile-on-quantile regression approach to the GRP index and financial asset returns. Our findings indicate that (i) most assets are in a mix of negative and positive relationship with GPR; (ii) GPR leads to changes in asset returns during normal market conditions; and (iii) the magnitude and direction of GPR's effect on asset returns depend on the type of market and market conditions.",
