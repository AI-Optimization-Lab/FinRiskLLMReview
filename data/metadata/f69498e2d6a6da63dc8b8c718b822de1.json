  "abstract": "Background: Venous pigmentation and ulceration in varicose veins pose significant financial and psychological burdens and affect quality of life. Not all varicose veins progress to this stage (C4-C6 in CEAP classification), and knowing the predictors for progressing to pigmentation/ulceration in varicose veins helps address high-risk patients early on. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective observational study done in patients diagnosed with varicose veins in the great saphenous system and subjected to radiofrequency ablation with or without any adjunct procedure during the time frame of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Using standardized questionnaires, physicians interviewing participants at the time of examination noted risk factors for pigmentation/ulceration in the form of age, gender, duration of illness, and symptoms. Results: Among 247 limbs with varicose veins that involved the great saphenous vein and were subjected for radiofrequency ablation, C3 stage was observed in the highest percentage of cases (44.5%) followed by C2 stage (27.9%). Pigmentation or ulceration were observed in 27.5% of cases. Duration of illness (longer duration), male gender, and age (higher age) were identified as predictors of pigmentation or ulceration. Conclusion: Large-scale studies to identify cutoff values for duration of illness and age would help clinicians in making treatment decisions.",
