  "title": "When Doctors Struggle: Current Stressors and Evaluation Recommendations for Physicians Contemplating Suicide",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to document current risk factors associated with physicians' suicide ideation among a group of doctors enrolled in a Physician Health Program. A retrospective cohort study was drawn from administrative data. The study compared intake information between doctors who reported recent thoughts of suicide (n=70) and those who did not (n=1,572) using adjusted regression analysis. Current stressors included personal, financial, health, and occupational problems; ideation was more likely with multiple stressors. Physicians endorsing suicidal ideation lacked personal supports and scored differently on Short Form-36 measures. Evaluators treating physicians should assess enduring risks and current stressors, particularly multiple stressors, to help detect suicidal patients. Current stressors should not be viewed as transitory and it is critical to bring in collateral information.",
