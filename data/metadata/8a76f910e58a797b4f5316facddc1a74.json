  "title": "Risk factors and medical costs for healthcare-associated carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli infection among hospitalized patients in a Chinese teaching hospital",
  "abstract": "Background: The emergence and spread of Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC) is becoming a serious problem in Chinese hospitals, however, the data on this is scarce. Therefore, we investigate the risk factors for healthcare-associated CREC infection and study the incidence, antibiotic resistance and medical costs of CREC infections in our hospital. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, matched case-control-control, parallel study in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients admitted between January 2012 and December 2015 were included in this study. For patients with healthcare-associated CREC infection, two matched subject groups were created; one group with healthcareassociated CSEC infection and the other group without infection. Results: Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated that prior hospital stay (< 6 months) (OR: 3.96; 95% CI: 1.26-12.42), tracheostomy (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.14-4.38), central venous catheter insertion (OR: 8.15; 95% CI: 2.31-28.72), carbapenem exposure (OR: 12.02; 95% CI: 1.52-95.4), urinary system disease (OR: 16.69; 95% CI: 3.01-89. 76), low hemoglobin (OR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.46-5.50), and high blood glucose are associated (OR: 7.01; 95% CI: 1.89-26. 02) with CREC infection. Total costs (p = 0.00), medical examination costs (p = 0.00), medical test costs (p = 0.00), total drug costs (p = 0.00) and ant-infective drug costs (p = 0.00) for the CREC group were significantly higher than those for the no infection group. Medical examination costs (p = 0.03), total drug costs (p = 0.03), and anti-infective drug costs (p = 0.01) for the CREC group were significantly higher than for the CSEC group. Mortality in CREC group was significantly higher than the CSEC group (p = 0.01) and no infection group (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Many factors were discovered for acquisition of healthcare-associated CREC infection. CREC isolates were resistant to most antibiotics, and had some association with high financial burden and increased mortality.",
