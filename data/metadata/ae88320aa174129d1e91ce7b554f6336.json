  "title": "IMPLEMENTATION OF INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS",
  "abstract": "The paper presents how can be integrated and evaluated the risks in industrial process. Implementation of integrated risk management system involves consideration of all risk types such as technological risk, financial risk, environmental pollution and natural hazards. To treat the risk it must be defined, identified using the group creativity techniques or structured and systematic examination techniques, analyzed and quantified in terms of risk likelihood and consequences, assessed according to predetermined criteria and monitored after implementation of risk treatment measures. The paper shows the integration of risk management procedure and an example for industrial implementation. The obtained results base on implementation of integrated risk management system lead to a better understanding of the risk consequences, an exact classification in risk matrix of probability - consequence type and also lead to a efficiently of activity through increased the safety in operation.",
