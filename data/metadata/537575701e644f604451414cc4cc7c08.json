  "title": "STUDIES OF FACTORS AFFECTING RISK ASSESSMENT OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT IN THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",
  "abstract": "Risk assessment of material misstatement is an important decision in the audited financial statements now. Therefore, the author performed the study of factors affecting the risk assessment of material misstatement. The study helps auditors to have reference to the risks assessment of material misstatement. At the same time the research results also help businesses take measures to remedy internal problems in order to limit the risks of material misstatement. The author uses expert interviewing method and multivariate analysis (factor analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis) to obtain the results. There are two factors that affect the risk assessment of material misstatement: (1) Business' controlled environment, and (2) Business' process of risk assessment. Other factors do not affect to the risk assessment of material misstatement.",
