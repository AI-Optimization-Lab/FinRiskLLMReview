  "title": "Testing the Validity of the Unconditional and Conditional CAPM on the Egyptian Stock Market Using Panel Data Analysis",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to test the validity of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) in the Egyptian stock mar-ket, in its unconditional and conditional forms. Both simple and multiple panel data analyses are used to test the CAPM, using data from 118 individual stocks and 10 stock portfolios over the 2011-2019 period, based on 1062 firm/year observations and 90 portfolio/year observations for each stock market index. Four stock market indices are used to estimate beta using five-year monthly data, based on 4248 time series regression models for the period 2006-2018. The results support the conditional CAPM, which considers market condition, and contradict the unconditional one. These results are robust to the use of other data frequencies (daily and weekly) to estimate beta, and to the exclu-sion of financial sector firms. The main practical implication of this study is to guide Firms' stakeholders such as in-vestors, portfolio managers, firm managers, and researchers to employ the conditional CAPM in predicting stock re-turns based on panel data analysis. Further, several avenues for future research are proposed.",
