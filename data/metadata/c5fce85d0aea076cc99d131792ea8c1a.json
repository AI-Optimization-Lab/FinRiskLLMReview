  "abstract": "Objective:To compare the adverse event profile and patient comorbidity profile of lower extremity orthopaedic trauma patients admitted via interfacility transfer (IT) to direct admission (DA) patients from home.Methods:A total of 39,497 patients from 2012 to 2019 were identified in the American College of Surgeon National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. DA patients were compared with IT patients for differences in preoperative comorbidities, adverse events, length of stay, and readmissions in the 30-day postoperative period. Student t tests were used to assess continuous variables. Pearson chi(2) test and odds ratios (ORs) were used for categorical variables.Results:The IT group comprised 7167 patients, and the DA group comprised 32,330 patients. IT patients were on average older (65.5 vs. 58.8 years, P < 0.01), more likely to be American Society of Anesthesiologists Status >2 (P < 0.01), and had a worse comorbidity profile for numerous preoperative risk factors. IT patients had significantly higher rates of mortality [3.3% vs. 1.4%; odds ratio (OR) 2.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.96-2.77], major complications (10.2% vs. 6.1%; OR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.60-1.91), significantly higher readmission rates (5.8% vs. 4.8%, P < 0.01, OR 1.22 95% CI, 1.09-1.36), and more infectious complications (7% vs. 4.7%; OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.38-1.71) than DA patients. Transfer remained a significant factor predicting major adverse events in regression analysis controlling for patient characteristics and fracture type (P < 0.01; B 1.197; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32).Conclusions:This study revealed that IT patients undergoing operative management of pelvic, acetabular, and lower extremity fractures are at a significantly increased risk of major complications, readmission, and have a higher morbidity burden than DA patients. As healthcare transitions to value-based care and bundled payments, hospitals that accept a high volume of ITs will face exposure to added risk and financial penalties without adequate policy protections.",
