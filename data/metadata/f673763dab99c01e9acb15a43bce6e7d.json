  "title": "Research on Risk Assessment and Prediction of RMB Internationalization Based on the PCA-SA-BPNN Model",
  "abstract": "This paper combines principal component analysis, a BP neural network, and a simulated annealing algorithm, to construct a PCA-SA-BPNN risk forecast model to evaluate and predict the RMB internationalization risk status of China. First, we analyze the risk of RMB internationalization and its transmission mechanism from the perspective of the economic characteristics of neighboring countries and trading partner countries. Second, we use the FASP index system construction method for reference to construct a forecast index system for macro- and microrisks brought about by RMB internationalization. Then, the weight of each index is determined through index common degree analysis and principal component analysis, and the risk of RMB internationalization is divided. On this basis, the risks of RMB internationalization in China from 2000 to 2019 are divided into four categories. Based on the BP neural network algorithm optimized by the simulated degradation algorithm, the PCA-SA-BPNN model of RMB internationalization risk forecast is constructed. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by experimental verification, and the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is simulated and predicted. The research results show that the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is basically safe, and the risks of RMB internationalization mainly come from macroeconomic growth risks and systemic risks of the financial system.",
