  "title": "Consumer Decision-making, Perceived Product Value, and Purchasing Behavior in the Taipei Digital Camera Market",
  "abstract": "This study examined consumers decision-making styles by using the Consumer Styles Inventory (CSI) by Sui, Hui, Wang, and Chang (2001). It also investigated the relationship between the decision-making styles and the Perceived Value (PV) (Teas & Agarwal, 2001) when purchasing digital cameras and related equipments. The Independent Sample t test and Multiple Regression was used in analyzing the data. The results of the study indicated that the consumers with price-value consciousness decision-making styles had a positive relationship with perceived product quality and had a negative relationship with perceived product value and perceived performance risk. The consumers with perfectionism decision-making styles had a negative relationship with perceived sacrifice and perceived financial risk. The consumers with confused by over choice decision-making styles had a positive relationship with perceived product quality, and had a negative relationship with perceived product value and perceived product performance risk. Marketing managers could use this information to target consumers which had certain traits in these decision-making styles.",
