  "title": "BISTRO: Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization",
  "abstract": "The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.",
