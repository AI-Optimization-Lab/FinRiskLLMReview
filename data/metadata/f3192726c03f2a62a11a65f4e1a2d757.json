  "title": "MACROECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL DISTRESS",
  "abstract": "The importance of assessing the company's financial performance has been steadily rising in recent years. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate to what extent the financial situation of the company, especially the risk of financial distress and bankruptcy, is influenced by the macroeconomic environment defined by fundamental macroeconomic variables. The analysis of the interrelationships will be carried out not only at national level, but also at sector level according to NACE classification for Visegrad Group countries. To achieve the goal of the thesis, predictive bankruptcy models offinancial distress based on financial analysis of enterprises will be used as well as regression analysis and correlation analysis. The observed period for analyzes will be from 2009 to 2016. It seems appropriate to pay particular attention to examining the impact of economic growth, interest rates, inflation rates, the exchange rate and the rate of unemployment on the financial situation of the enterprise. These indicators play an important role in defining internal and external economic equilibrium, which is also reflected in the functioning of individual businesses and sectors.",
