  "title": "A Hopfield Network for the Portfolio Selection Problem",
  "abstract": "Given a set of available assets the portfolio selection problem consists in finding out the best way of investing a particular amount of money in the assets Some heuristic methods based on evolutionary algorithms tabu search and simulated annealing have been developed in the past Here we present a Hopfield neural network model to solve the portfolio selection problem comparing the new results to those obtained with the other heuristic methods",
