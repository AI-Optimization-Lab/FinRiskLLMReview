  "title": "Optimal Portfolio Selection with Different Approximated Returns",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the impact of the approximation methods on the large-scale portfolio selection problems. In particular, we compare conditional expectation estimation from both parametric and nonparametric regression models. In this context, we use a general nonparametric multivariate regression framework to cope with several problems arising with linear regression approximation. To this end, we firstly reduce the dimensionality of the large-scale portfolio by performing a principal component analysis on the stock returns. Then, within k-fund separation model, we use different methodologies to approximate the portfolio returns. Finally, through an empirical analysis, we show the impact of regression estimation on the ex-post sample paths of several portfolio strategies. The proposed empirical analysis confirms that it is better using nonparametric regression rather than the classical parametric regression.",
