  "title": "Water transfer from agriculture to urban uses: lessons learned, with policy considerations",
  "abstract": "This paper sets forth the accomplishments to date of the international collaborative study program on efficient and equitable transfer of water from agriculture to other uses. The research consists of several components. First a bibliographical review was prepared of literature available on the practice of inter-sector water transfer. Second, nine case studies have been prepared that illustrate inter-sector water transfer under a variety of physical and economic and political environments. Third, a framework has been developed for characterizing and comparing water transfer options and compensation among case studies. We discuss the pricing of irrigation water in determining compensation. We develop a decision tree that traces the paths to the various sector water transfer options. Finally, we discuss water transfer policy options with specific reference to Taiwan, though they have more general relevance. Three options are identified which reflect different objectives for government intervention.",
