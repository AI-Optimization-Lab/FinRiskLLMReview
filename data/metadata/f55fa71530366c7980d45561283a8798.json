  "title": "Innovation in public administration: bibliometric analysis from the mapping of international literature",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study is to present the characteristics of international scientific publications related to the adoption of innovations in public administration through electronic systems. The Proknow-C was used as a research instrument. After applying filters for title, abstract, full-text reading, and scientific recognition, a Final Bibliographic Portfolio (BP) of 30 articles was obtained. The results highlighted the authors and journals that have published the most on the subject, the most referenced scientific articles, the most frequently used keywords, the strongest co-authorship networks, the countries that stand out the most in publications on the subject, and characteristics of the co-citation network. Thus, this study contributes to the proposal of a BP aligned with the topic, whose analysis of the characteristics provides information for public administrators to support their practices and decisions based on literature backed by international scientific recognition.",
