  "title": "Comparison and Analysis of CAPM and BAPM Models",
  "abstract": "By means of theoretical and empirical analysis, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and behavior asset pricing model (BAPM) were evaluated. The time series regression and cross-sectional regression were established with the empirical data from Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets in the last two years. Comparison of the empirical data between the last two years and the financial crisis as well as the comparison of empirical results among Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets were made. A widespread noise trader risk existed in Shanghai stock and Hongkong H shares market in the last two years, but the noise trader risk was less in Shenzhen stock market. During financial crisis, the noise trader risk also existed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. There is no obvious correlation between noise trader risk and stock returns. The explanatory ability of behavior asset pricing model for stock excess returns is better than capital asset pricing model.",
