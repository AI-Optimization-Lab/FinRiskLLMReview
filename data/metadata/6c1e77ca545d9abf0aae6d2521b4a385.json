  "title": "OPTIMAL HEDGE RATIO FOR NON-FERROUS METALS: IN-SAMPLE ANALYSIS",
  "abstract": "Hedging supposes the combination of a risk generating spot position with a contrary position taken on a different highly correlated asset. Thus, the main objective of hedging is to reduce the risk by minimizing the variance of the hedged portfolio's value. In order to achieve an efficient hedging strategy, the estimation of the optimal hedge ratio is needed. This paper estimates the optimal hedge ratio in the case of the non-ferrous metals traded on the London Metals Exchange, using three methods: the simple OLS regression, the error-correction model (ECM) and the auto regressive distributed lag model (ARDL). The results show that the optimal hedge ratio and hedging effectiveness increase with hedging horizon, converging to 1 for long tenors. The findings also show that the models that account for the cointegration between spot and futures prices perform better in sample than the OLS model.",
