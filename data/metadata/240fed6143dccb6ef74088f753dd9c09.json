  "abstract": "in a number of listed companies to choose stocks to invest in, stock-market investors are focused on the key issues. Based on Shanghai 180 index as a benchmark, net rates, earnings, municipal rates, cash flow increased four factor classification for quality, value growth three factors, construction quality-value, growth-value, quality-value, growth-quality growth, value and quality growth of seven large stock selection model. For each factor in order from lowest to highest rated, got the top elected a number of stock building portfolios. Quantitative methods in Shanghai a-share market to find some relatively good stock build a portfolio of different styles, and the historical data show that these combinations are valid, so as to provide investment reference for stock investors.",
