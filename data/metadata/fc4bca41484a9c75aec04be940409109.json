  "title": "Early Marriage and Negative Life Events Affect on Depression in Young Adults and Adolescents",
  "abstract": "Background: Negative life events (NLEs) and early marriage (EM), a worldwide social silent problem, are increasing in prevalence globally. Evidence is lacking regarding their impact on depression. We assessed the impact of EM and NLEs on depression among adolescents, young adults and adults in Iran. Methods: A population-based descriptive study was performed among urban and rural population aged 13-40 years. Beck depression inventory scale II and life event questionnaire were used to assess the severity of depression and NLEs, respectively. EM was defined as a marriage or union between two persons in which one or both parties are younger than 18. Results: In a total of 530 participants (300 female and 230 male) with a mean age of 26.78 +/- 5.06, almost 46% had depressive symptoms. A trend was found between rising age and depression so that among the three groups of study subjects, adults had the highest prevalence rate (49.34%). After adjusting for age, residence, substance abuse, alcohol abuse, unemployment and other NLEs by multiple regression, we found statistically significant relationships between depression and EM (2.77; CI: 1.75-4.57), and NLEs (2.78; CI: 1.85-4.19). Among types of NLEs, marital conflicts (5.8; CI: 1.60-20.81), loss of loved ones (6.12; CI: 1.28-28.26) and financial problems (13.79; CI: 1.72-108.17) were associated with depression risk. Conclusion: Life skills improving program with intersectoral collaborative care to reduce determinants of EM and NLEs in the community, as well as training and screening for depression among adolescents and adulthood are necessary.",
