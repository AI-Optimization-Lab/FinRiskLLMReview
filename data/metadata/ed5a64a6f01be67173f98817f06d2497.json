  "title": "An Empirical Study of EVA on Capital Structure-based on New Energy Shipping Companies Data",
  "abstract": "As an important supplement to the traditional fossil energy, new energy industry developed, quickly these days It is important to configure the capital structure to make the cost and risk to a minimum level Also the enterprise could maximize its value by adjusting financial leverage This paper uses empirical analysis method to verify the EVA effect on capital structure by constructing the panel data model, Then according to the regression analysis of EVA, EPS and ROE on the capital structure of new energy enterprises, the paper compares the influence of EVA and the traditional profit index on corporate capital structure.",
