  "title": "How Financial Beliefs and Behaviors Influence the Financial Health of Individuals Struggling with Opioid Use Disorder",
  "abstract": "The surge in opioid use disorder (OUD) over the past decade escalated opioid overdoses to a leading cause of death in the United States. With adverse effects on cognition, risk-taking, and decision-making, OUD may negatively influence financial well-being. This study examined the financial health of individuals diagnosed with OUD by reviewing financial beliefs and financial behaviors. We evaluated quality of life, perceptions of financial condition during active use and recovery, and total debt. We distributed a 20-item survey to 150 individuals in an outpatient treatment program for OUD in a large metropolitan area, yielding a 56% response rate. The results revealed low overall financial health, with a median debt of USD 12,961 and a quality-of-life score of 72.80, 9.4% lower than the U.S. average (82.10). Most participants (65.75%) reported improved financial health during recovery, while a higher majority (79.45%) worsened during active use. Unemployment affected 42% of respondents, and 9.52% were employed only part-time. Regression analysis highlighted a strong association between lack of full-time employment and a lack of financial advising with total debt. High financial anxiety and active use were associated with lower quality of life. Individuals with OUD may benefit from financial interventions, resources, and counseling to improve their financial health.",
