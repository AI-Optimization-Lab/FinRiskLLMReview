  "title": "Stock hunting or blue chip investments? Investors' preferences for stocks in virtual geographies of social networks",
  "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the individual investors' preferences towards stock selection in social media environments. The study is conducted to understand the implications and conceptual directions for the corporates and financial advisors to understand the choices of individual investors applied in financial markets. Further, this study aims to examine the selection of the most preferred social media platform and behavioral intentions of investors towards selection of investment portfolios in Indian stock markets. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was designed based on the technique of conjoint analysis and was responded by 428 respondents belonging to the Northern region of India. The estimation of preference functions in Conjoint Analysis was designed by using orthogonal arrays and was calculated using the ordinary least square regression technique. Findings - This study reveals that while making selection of desired investment portfolios, the investors give highest preference to social media platforms in terms of highest utility value and range followed by their preference for behavioral intentions to invest. Among different social media platforms, the investors preferred Twitter the most, followed by Facebook and the primary interest of investors was observed towards Intra-day trading purposes and balanced portfolio investments in financial markets. The major reason behind opting the social media platforms was selection of speculative stocks. Research limitations/implications - The actual individual investment behavior cannot be observed through the survey, which limits the external validity of the study. Originality/value - The paper is a first of its kind to empirically identify the individual investors and their preferences and choices by applying conjoint analysis in the new social media environment. The study thus integrates the gap between marketing theories and emerging theories of behavioral finance to understand the investor behavior in a better way.",
