  "title": "Determinants of Commute Distance in South East Queensland, Australia: Implications for Usage-based Pricing in Lower-density Urban Settings",
  "abstract": "Usage-based road charges are expected to reduce the use of private vehicles. To assess this assumption, this study investigates the factors currently influencing commute distance in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. A multiple regression model was estimated to identify the significant determinants of commute distance, followed by a hierarchical regression analysis to ascertain the contribution of personal characteristics, household characteristics, work-related characteristics and accessibility. We conclude that many commuters would remain captive private vehicle usersuntil accessibility improves, and other transport modes offer viable commuting options. Alternatively, the pricing scheme should be adapted to suit local contexts.",
