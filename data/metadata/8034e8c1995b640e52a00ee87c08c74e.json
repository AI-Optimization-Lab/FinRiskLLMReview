  "title": "Stepwise expanding the frontier one asset at a time",
  "abstract": "Ukhov (2006) characterizes some rules to compare the global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) for expanding the frontier one asset at a time. Based on a regression hedge, this paper tests the GMVP's return and weights for Ukhov's classification. The illustration using DOW30 assets produces weak t-statistics of the GMVP returns across frontiers. In contrast, the evidence shows significant t-statistics when examining the portfolio weights. As an application of the weight t-statistics, we present a stepwise approach to constructing the frontier. Our stepwise GMVP's standard deviation also outperforms the simulated results for all the portfolio sizes.",
