  "title": "Innovating Project Management: AI Applications for Success Prediction and Resource Optimization",
  "abstract": "The revolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made transformative changes in all industries. The field of software engineering has great benefit from AI by Automat all process. Applying Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, to project management will transform traditional methodologies to new ways. This work investigates how AI can be used within project management to better allocate resources, estimate time, and predict costs. Data from many recourses used to improve accuracy in project planning, refine how risks are managed, and develop new methods. Data includes real projects portfolio, open-source data, and simulated data. The integration of AI in project management examines project success and client satisfaction. This work shows 99% accuracy for learning and 78% for testing of predicting project success and highlights the need to constantly update methods to effectively use the big potential changes AI can bring to project management.",
