  "title": "Empirical Study on Managerial Risk-averse and Financing Behavior",
  "abstract": "The behavioral finance has been developing in 1980s, it proposed a new perspective for the classic financial theory cannot explain or inadequate market vision. Based on study model of finance irrational managers in behavioral corporate, this paper employed DJ-China 88 index from 2000 to 2004, using Logistic regression and independent-samples T test and analyzed the financing behavior which the risk-averse managers did through proposing a financing decision-making model under rational investors and risk-averse managers, using risk aversion index to measure managerial risk aversion under behavioral corporate finance paradigm. The findings show, at the premise of controlling other variables, the risk-averse index has significant negative impact on debt financing decisions. The higher the degree of risk-averse of managers is, the smaller the likelihood of debt financing is, which means risk-averse managers prefer stock financing.",
