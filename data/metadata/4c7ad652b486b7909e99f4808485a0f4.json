  "title": "Multidimensional Financial Metrics for Corporate Financial Risk Assessment and Early Warning Mechanisms",
  "abstract": "By constructing a comprehensive multi-dimensional financial index evaluation system, this study effectively identifies, evaluates, and forewarns the financial risks of enterprises. Utilizing public financial data from S&P Global and Alpha Vantage, a BP neural network-based enterprise financial risk assessment framework is built, and the KMO method analyzes different risk factors. This comprehensive evaluation model, paired with a risk warning mechanism, assesses financial and cash flow indicators. The example analysis shows: 1) The RMSE value ranges from 46.71 to 64.94, indicating high accuracy and stability in predicting financial risk; 2) The R value is very close to 1, demonstrating high stability.",
