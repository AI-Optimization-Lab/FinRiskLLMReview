  "title": "Public Pensions and Private Savingst",
  "abstract": "How does the provision of public pension benefits impact private savings? We answer this question in the context of a Danish reform that increased social security eligibility ages. Using administrative data and a regression discontinuity design , we identify the causal effects of the policy on savings throughout the financial portfolio. We find increases in contributions to personal and employer -sponsored retirement accounts when delayed benefit eligibility induces extended employment. We argue that inertia -the continuation of previous savings behaviors -is a key mechanism , and we highlight how firm default contribution rate policies can mediate savings responses to social security reform.
