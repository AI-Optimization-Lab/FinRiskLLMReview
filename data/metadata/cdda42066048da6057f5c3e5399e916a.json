  "title": "Health care costs for adolescents and young adults with cancer: a Wisconsin community-based hospital study between 2005 and 2020",
  "abstract": "Introduction Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer are at risk of high cumulative healthcare system costs potentially associated with poor health and financial outcomes. Although this has been studied at academic centers, little data on AYA costs at community-based practices exist. The goals of this study were to understand direct health care costs for AYA patients, identify factors for high costs, and assess how total health care costs may relate to survival. Methods AYA patients (15-39 years) treated at a community hospital in Wisconsin (USA) between 2005 and 2020 were identified. Patient demographics, cancer characteristics, therapies, support services, and all direct health care charges (including up to 1 year prior to diagnosis to capture any diagnostic workup) were collected. Logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression models identified factors associated with high costs and survival, respectively. Results The 388 AYA patients had a median follow-up of 9 years (97% survival). Most were 30-39 years (62%), female (61%), white (95%), diagnosed early-stage (85%), and underwent surgery (83%). Complete health care costs were available for 233 patients (60%). Median total costs per patient were $123 K (range, $73-$215 K). On adjusted analysis, higher direct health care costs (> $125 K) were associated with greater odds of hospital admissions (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.35-2.27), chemotherapy (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.44-12.70), and breast cancer diagnosis (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.07-14.70). Living farther from the hospital (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.02-0.50), later year of diagnosis (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.55-0.77), and uninsured/unknown insurance status (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.01-0.57) were associated with decreased odds of having higher health care costs. On adjusted analysis, death was associated with greater odds of higher direct health care costs per $125 K (hazards ratio [HR] = 7.9, 95% CI = 2.22-27.80) and radiation (HR = 31.8, 95% CI = 3.15-321) but lower odds of hormone therapy (HR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.01-0.72) and later year of diagnosis (HR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.12-0.60). Conclusion High direct health care costs among AYA patients are associated with hospital admissions, chemotherapy, breast cancer diagnosis, hospital proximity, and earlier year of diagnosis. Death was associated with high direct health care costs, earlier years of diagnosis, and radiation therapy. Total health care costs in community-based hospitals should be considered in the context of AYA patients with cancer.",
