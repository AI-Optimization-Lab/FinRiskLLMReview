  "title": "A Multilevel Monte Carlo Method for the Valuation of Swing Options",
  "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel approach for the valuation of swing options. Swing options are a kind of American options with multiple exercise rights traded in energy markets. Longstaff and Schwartz have suggested a regression-based Monte Carlo method known as the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method to value American options. In this work, first we introduce the LSMC method for the pricing of swing options. Then, to achieve a desired accuracy for the price estimation, we combine the idea of LSMC with multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Finally, to illustrate the proper behavior of this combination, we conduct numerical results based on the Black-Scholes model. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",
