  "abstract": "This study assesses the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and identifies the significant factors that expose households to higher levels of out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure. Data from the fifth and the sixth Ethiopian National Health Accounts household surveys, which were conducted in 2012-13 and 2015-16, respectively, are used. The incidence of CHE is estimated using both the capacity-to-pay and the budget share approaches. To ensure the robustness of our findings, both unconditional and conditional quantile estimators are adopted as multivariate regression techniques to estimate the impact of socio-economic variables on the distribution of households' OOP expenditure. Our findings show that the incidence of CHE in Ethiopia ranges from 1.7% to 4.7% depending on the approach and the threshold adopted. Larger families, the unemployed, the extremely poor, those who seek care at private-owned providers and families with members affected by chronic illness face higher OOP expenditure. Hence, policy should target those with these identified socio-economic characteristics in the provision of financial risk protection such as fee waiver systems and subsidies.",
