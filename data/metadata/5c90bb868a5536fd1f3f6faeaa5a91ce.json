  "title": "Scoring in microfinance: credit risk management tool-Case of Morocco",
  "abstract": "The aim of this research lies in the development of a credit-scoring model using logistic regression and multivariate discriminant analysis applied to 1500 individual loans from Moroccan MFIs. This model combines both behavioral and descriptive data related to the borrowers (age, activity, level of education, number of unpaid debts, number of loans, etc.) and others related to the institution (amount of credit, duration of credit, number of concluded loans per portfolio manager etc.). The results showed the importance of having a larger sample, a deep enough history on the behavior of the customer, and also more information about variables related to the client's activity and its performance to better predict the default.
