  "title": "A novel prediction model based on long short-term memory optimised by dynamic evolutionary glowworm swarm optimisation for money laundering risk",
  "abstract": "The accurate prediction of money laundering risk is conducive to the risk prevention, and its task implies the characteristics of time series. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is widely developed in time series problems, but its parameters need to be optimised for delivering good predictive capacity. In this work, a novel bio-inspired algorithm, named dynamic evolutionary glowworm swarm optimisation (DEGSO), is designed. DEGSO employs adaptive step-size strategy, dynamic evolutionary mechanism, and directional mutation mechanism for improving the search performance. The money laundering risk is identified via a combination of DEGSO and LSTM (DEGSO-LSTM). DEGSO is wielded to optimise the main parameters of LSTM. Numerical results on four test functions indicate that DEGSO delivers better performance. Performance test results demonstrate that DEGSO-LSTM performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches. DEGSO-LSTM also attains satisfactory results in money laundering risk prediction, and its potential as a solution to financial fraud risk prediction.",
