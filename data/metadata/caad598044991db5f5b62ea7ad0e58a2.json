  "title": "Stock exchange prediction and portfolio administration by statistics and artificial neural networks",
  "abstract": "This paper describes the techniques used to develop a system capable of modeling the complex relations of the Mexican stock exchange by statistics methods as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Finally, portfolio administration is performed via quadratic programming and genetic algorithms (GA). These methodologies constitute an alternative to classic statistical models of regression, variance and mean.",
