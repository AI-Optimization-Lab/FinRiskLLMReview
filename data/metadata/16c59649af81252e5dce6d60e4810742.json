  "title": "Large portfolio optimisation approaches",
  "abstract": "This paper makes an empirical comparison of prominent methods in portfolio optimisation, such as nodewise regression, the sample covariance matrix, observable factor model-based covariance matrices, linear and nonlinear shrinkage methods, and principal orthogonal complement thresholding (POET) estimators. Empirically, we find that the nodewise regression approach that uses a direct estimator of the sparse inverse covariance matrix improves portfolio performance among existing methods in mean-variance portfolio optimisation when the number of stocks is greater than the number of observations.",
