  "title": "Fuzzy portfolio selection with different risk attitudes based on machine learning",
  "abstract": "This paper studies a fuzzy portfolio selection program with different risk attitudes based on Machine Learning to help investors make reasonable investment decisions. Firstly, the asset's return is assumed as a fuzzy variable, which is estimated by the Long-Short Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest, respectively. Secondly, the possibilistic mean and possibilistic variance with different risk attitudes are calculated within the framework of possibilistic theory. Thirdly, considering the borrowing constraints, transaction costs, and threshold constraints, a fuzzy portfolio selection model with different risk attitudes based on Machine Learning is proposed. According to the possibilistic measure, the proposed model is transformed into a quadratic programming problem, and the pivoting algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, the possibility equal-weight portfolio model and possibility mean-variance portfolio model based on history quartile are selected as benchmarks, and a comparing numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",
