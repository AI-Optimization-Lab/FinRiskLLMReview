  "title": "Noninvasive Angiographic Results of Clipped or Coiled Intracranial Aneurysms: An Inter- and Intraobserver Reliability Study",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive angiography is commonly used to assess the outcome of surgical or endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms in clinical series or randomized trials. We sought to assess whether a standardized 3-grade classification system could be reliably used to compare the CTA and MRA results of both treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic portfolio composed of CTAs of 30 clipped and MRAs of 30 coiled aneurysms was independently evaluated by 24 raters of diverse experience and training backgrounds. Twenty raters performed a second evaluation 1 month later. Raters were asked which angiographic grade and management decision (retreatment; close or long-term follow-up) would be most appropriate for each case. Agreement was analyzed using the Krippendorff ? (?(K)) statistic, and the relationship between angiographic grade and clinical management choice, using the Fisher exact and Cramer V tests. RESULTS: Interrater agreement was substantial (?(K) = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55?0.70); results were slightly better for MRA results of coiling (?(K) = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56?0.76) than for CTA results of clipping (?(K) = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44?0.69). Intrarater agreement was substantial to almost perfect. Interrater agreement regarding clinical management was moderate for both clipped (?(K) = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32?0.61) and coiled subgroups (?(K) = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34?0.54). The choice of clinical management was strongly associated with the size of the residuum (mean Cramer V = 0.77 [SD, 0.14]), but complete occlusions (grade 1) were followed more closely after coiling than after clipping (P?=?.01). CONCLUSIONS: A standardized 3-grade scale was found to be a reliable and clinically meaningful tool to compare the results of clipping and coiling of aneurysms using CTA or MRA.",
