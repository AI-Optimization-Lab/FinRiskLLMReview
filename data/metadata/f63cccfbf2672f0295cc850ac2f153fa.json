  "title": "Automated Trading with Machine Learning on Big Data",
  "abstract": "Financial markets are now extremely efficient, nevertheless there are still many investment funds that generate alpha systematically beating markets' return benchmarks. The emergence of big data gave professional traders the new territory, leverage and evidence and renewed opportunities of their profitable exploitation by Machine Learning (ML) models, increasingly taking over the trading floor by 24/7 automated trading in response to the continuously fed data streams. Rapidly increasing data sizes and strictly real-time requirements of the trading models render large subset of ML methods intractable, overcomplex and impossible to apply in practise. In this work we demonstrate how to efficiently approach the problem of automated trading with large portfolio strategy that continuously consumes streams of data across multiple diverse markets. We demonstrate a simple scalable trading model that learns to generate profit from multiple inter-market price predictions and markets' correlation structure. We also introduce the stochastic trade diffusion technique to maximise trading turnover while reducing strategy's exposure to market impact and construct the efficient risk-mitigating portfolio that backtests with the strong positive return.",
