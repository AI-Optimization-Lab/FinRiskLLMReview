  "title": "Factors Affecting Investor Switching Intention to Fintech Peer-To-Peer Lending",
  "abstract": "This research investigates the factors that influence the Investor switching intention from deposits or investing their funds in traditional financial services, namely banks, to invest in the Financial Technology Peer-to-Peer Lending. We build the research model adapting the Push-Pull Mooring (PPM) Framework to describe the migration theory of customers switching behavior. The Push factors include customer's Satisfaction on Bank and perceived Service Quality on Bank. While the Pull Factors is Individual's Knowledge toward Peer-to-Peer Lending and Personal Reward Sensitivity. Multiple Regression Analysis is used to analyze the model and relationship between variables. We collected data from 170 respondents who are investing part of their portfolio in a bank deposit. We find that Pushing factors of customer satisfaction and perceived Service Quality on banks has a negative effect on investor switching intention. The Pull factor of an Individual's Knowledge toward Peer-to-Peer Lending and personal Reward Sensitivity positively affects investor switching intention.",
