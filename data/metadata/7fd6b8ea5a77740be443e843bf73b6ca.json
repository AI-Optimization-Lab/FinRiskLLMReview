  "title": "Can ChatGPT predict Chinese equity premiums?",
  "abstract": "Leveraging over 1.86 million news headlines, we examine the capability of ChatGPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM), to predict equity risk premiums in the Chinese market. The predictive scores from ChatGPT not only positively and significantly forecast equity premiums but also markedly outperform the bag-of-words (BoW) method, demonstrating its superior capability to discern intricate market sentiments from extensive datasets. The consistent and reliable performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample tests underscores the effectiveness of ChatGPT and its potential to revolutionize financial forecasting. This study highlights the substantial value and innovative contribution of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, in enriching the precision and depth of financial market analysis.",
