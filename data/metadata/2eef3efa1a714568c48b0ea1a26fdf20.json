  "title": "Research on Financial Risk Evaluation of Railway Logistics Based on BP Neural Network Model",
  "abstract": "This paper analyzes the risk factors of developing logistics finance business in railway enterprises, identifies the risks from two aspects of external risk and internal risk, and constructs the evaluation index system of railway logistics financial risk. Based on the analysis of BP neural network structure, the training and testing of the sampling samples are carried out by using the neural network, and the risk grade of each influencing factor is obtained, which provides a basis for judging the risk prevention and control of railway logistics finance.",
