  "abstract": "We are interested in modelling the time series process y(t) = sigma(x(t))epsilon(t), where epsilon(t) = phi(0)epsilon(t-1) + nu(t). This model is of interest as it provides a plausible linkage between risk and expected return of financial assets. Further, the model can serve as a vehicle for testing the martingale difference sequence hypothesis, which is typically uncritically adopted in financial time series models. When x(t) has a fixed design, we provide a novel nonparametric estimator of the variance function based on the difference approach and establish its limiting properties. When x(t) is strictly stationary on a strongly mixing base (hereby allowing for ARCH effects) the nonparametric variance function estimator by Fan and Yao [1998. Efficient estimation of conditional variance functions in stochastic regression. Biometrika 85, 645-660] can be applied and seems very promising. We propose a semiparametric estimator of phi(0) that is root T-consistent, adaptive, and asymptotic normally distributed under very general conditions on x(t). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
