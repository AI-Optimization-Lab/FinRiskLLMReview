  "title": "Jump Risk Contagion and Determinants Driven by COVID-19 in Sino-US Stock Market: An Empirical Analysis from a Dependence Perspective",
  "abstract": "This paper examines the jump risk contagion between the US and China during the financial crisis driven by COVID-19, and the impact of a series of determinants to detect the transmission mechanisms. Specifically, we employ the ARJI-GARCH model to capture jump behavior and apply the Clayton Copula to construct lower tail jump contagion. Furthermore, we conduct regression analysis on variables related to economic fundamentals and investor behavior to explore the fundamental or pure contagion hypotheses. Our results suggest an increased jump dependence during major catastrophic crises such as COVID-19, but it is closer to a memory-less process. Besides, bilateral trade, similarity in fundamentals and investor behavior are all important determinants, and pure contagion hypothesis exists between the Chinese and US stock markets during the pandemic.",
