  "title": "Future Use Intention Based on TAM-RI Model: A Study on Chinese College Student Credit Card",
  "abstract": "In some new industries, firms not only must introduce the new types of products or services but also enhance the customer loyalty so that customers purchase more products or service provided by focal firm. The customer relationship management with the double targets has vital theory and application means. This research built a new future use intention model of the colleges student credit card customers combining the Repurchase Intention Model with Technology Acceptance Model. This research carries on the survey in view of college student community. Then it draws the conclusion that there are seven factors which influence the future use intention: satisfaction, trust, financial risk, perceptive usefulness, and perceptive ease for use, switch cost and alternative attract. The result of regression analysis shows that the influence degrees from high to low are perceptive ease for use, trust, alternative attract, perceptive useful, satisfaction and financial risk.",
