  "abstract": "The purpose of This Study is to Provide Evidence Associated With Corporate Governance Role From the PRESPECTIVE That Whether Internal Mechanisms Are Effective on Bankruptcy of Firms or not. There fore, a Sample Consisted of 76 Listed Companies in Tehran Stock Exchange Over a Nine_year Period (1380_1388) Was Select and Investigated. For Hypothesis Testing, Cox Regression Have Been Used. Criteria Used for Corporate Governance are : Size of Board of Directors, Percentage of non Executive Directors, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Change, and Major Ownership. Control Variables of the Study are : Firm;s Size, Profitability, Interest Coverage Ratio, Liquidity, Financial Risk, and Operational Rick.
