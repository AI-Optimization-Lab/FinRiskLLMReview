  "title": "Fortune favours the bold? Exploring tournament behavior among Australian superannuation funds",
  "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the tournament induced risk-shifting behavior of Australian multi-sector growth funds. We apply a regression-based methodology and examine tournaments based on the calendar year and the financial year. In our core analysis we find evidence in favor of Taylor's (J Econ Behav Organ 1455: 1-11, 2003) risk shifting tournament hypothesis for financial year-end tournaments. Apart from the standard tournament hypothesis we also report a range of findings regarding stability; fund age; and fund size. Support for the Taylor hypothesis generally continues across these variations as well.",
