  "abstract": "The paper Evaluation of the Impact of Selected Variables on the Investment Behavior is focused on the behavioral finance and financial markets. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the impact of selected variables on the results of high liquid financial market investments, using a model of logistic regression. The set of variables includes for example gender of investor, length of trades, currency pair used for investment and its price, the volume of trade or an attitude to risk taking of investor. Data set was completed during lectures of Ing. Marek Jochec, PhD during years 2009 and 2014. There were involved 295 students in the research, who made more than 12 000 trades on the OANDA FX Trade Practice platform. Nowadays the data collection is proceeding at the VSBTUO, Faculty of Economic.",
