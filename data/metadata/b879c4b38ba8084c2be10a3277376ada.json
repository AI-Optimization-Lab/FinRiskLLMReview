  "title": "ALGORITHMS FOR HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION WITH APPLICATIONS IN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT",
  "abstract": "In this paper we propose two algorithms for hierarchical classification: CLAS.1, based on an ultrametric distance, and CLAS.2, based on a scatter function. We study their properties. We show that the classification constructed by CLAS.2 algorithm is identical with the classification constructed by CLAS.1 algorithm if the ultrametric distance used in the first algorithm is compatible with the scatter function used in the second algorithm. We develop two applications in Microsoft Visual Studio based on the algorithms proposed, using C# language. The software developed will be used to classify the shares from Bucharest Stock Exchange which had profit during the last two years, in order to find similarities and differences between these shares and build a diversified portfolio.",
