  "title": "A purchasing portfolio model for the commercial construction industry: a case study in a mega mall",
  "abstract": "The procurement phase is known as a major component of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects. One of the main reasons for the lack of timely completion of projects and creating additional costs is the poor performance of companies in this phase. The complexity of the purchasing process arises from a wide variety of project purchasing items and their suppliers. A purchasing portfolio model (PPM) has been developed based on the Kraljic model in the context of multi-criteria decision-making. The proposed hybrid model consists of a combination of DEMATEL and ANP (DANP) and VIKOR. The contribution of the work presents a hybrid MCDM method to clarify the interactive relationships among the criteria, Development of the Application Range of the Kraljic portfolio model, and a managerial tool for solving classification issues. Our study outcomes verified by a real Mall project and can be used by project professionals and academic researchers.",
