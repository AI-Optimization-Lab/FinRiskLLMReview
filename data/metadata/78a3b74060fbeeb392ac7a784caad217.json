  "title": "Research in Financial Risk Prediction on Biochemical Industry of China Listed Companies",
  "abstract": "Since the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange established for thirty years, our capital market has been booming and provides strong support to the listed company. However, because of the competition environment of market economy becoming more and more fiercely, more and more listed companies are faced with serious financial risk. This situation not only affects the normal development of the capital market, also give all the stakeholder, such as investors, creditors, etc, brought huge economic losses. The listed companies referred to biochemical industry are classified, and fifteen typical financial indexes are selected in this paper. The factor analysis is applied to analysis of sample in this paper firstly, and then scores of five principal components are calculated. In the end, factor scores are analyzed by method of logistic regression. Model of logistic regression is constructed to analyze financial crisis predication. The precision of this model is about seventy four point three percentage, which shows that this model could be used to analyze financial crisis of this industry.",
