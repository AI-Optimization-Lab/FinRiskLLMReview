  "title": "Prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: screening in Poland families",
  "abstract": "Purpose Elder abuse and neglect is one of the most important problems of social and health policy among countries around the world. Making a real and reliable assessment of the occurrence of abuse is difficult to implement. The aim of this work is to show the frequency of physical, psychological, sexual abuse and financial exploitation among older adults. Methods Older adults, who were aged >= 60 years (N = 200) were qualified for the study. The studied population consisted of 112 women (56.0%) and 88 men (44.0%). The whole project procedure only included filling in the survey questionnaire. The verification of hypotheses was based on tests: Chi square test, Chi square test with continuity correction and logistic regression models. Results Within the obtained own results, out of 200 older adults, 77 respondents (38.5%) experienced abuse and neglect during the last 12 months. Most of the respondents (68.8%) experienced various forms of abuse simultaneously. Among those who experienced abuse, 75.3% experienced psychological abuse, 68.8% financial exploitation, 48.1% physical abuse, and 22.1% experienced sexual abuse. The rate of physical (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.13, 5.44; p = 0.02), verbal (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.02, 3.67; p = 0.04), sexual (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.13, 14.5; p = 0.03) and economic (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.02, 3.83; p = 0.04) abuse is statistically significantly higher, respectively, in women than in men. The level of education is a risk fact for physical abuse (p = 0.02). It has also been shown that singles, people with the income < 233 EUR and people living in urban areas are most often victims of elder abuse and neglect. Conclusions The results suggest that elder abuse and neglect is a fairly common phenomenon. Our data also provide confirmation of other researches conducted in this area.",
