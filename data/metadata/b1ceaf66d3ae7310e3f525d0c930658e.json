  "abstract": "This paper develops a fuzzy clustering method based on the fuzzy t-norm, and uses the data of China securities market to analyze the factors influencing the portfolio selection. Furthermore, this paper estimates an investment portfolio based on fuzzy clustering. The results show that the investor can learn the feature of securities. This method is very important for the portfolio selection.",
