  "title": "Individual Traits, Risk Perception, Financial Literacy & Investment Decisions",
  "abstract": "The preferences of individual investors in making investment decisions are not only based on rational behavior like conventional financial science. Behavioral finance integrates a broad social science perspective in research in the field of financial economics. In this study, we investigate the variables that influence investment decisions in individual investors. The purpose of this study is to find out whether individual traits, risk perception and financial literacy affect investment decisions. We tested multiple linear regression with 475 survey respondents. We find that individual traits variables measured by emotional intelligence and locus of control affect the choice of investment instruments for individual investors. Individual traits variable measured by characteristic didn't affect investment decision. Risk perception affects investment decisions. Individual traits and risk perception variables were measured by several survey questions. We also find that financial literacy as measured by the scoring method influences investment decisions but not by financial literacy as measured by self-assessment. Only 37.47% (178 out of 475 people) respondents answered correctly over 80% of the financial literacy questions. Our result imply that policy makers should be careful to put financial advice forward as a mechanism to curb the ill effect of low financial literacy.",
