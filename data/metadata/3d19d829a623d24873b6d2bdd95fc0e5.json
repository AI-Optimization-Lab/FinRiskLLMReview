  "title": "RETRACTED: Discovery of technology trends from patent data on the basis of predictive analytics (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "Companies are increasingly paying close attention to the IP portfolio, which is a key competitive advantage, so patents and patent applications, as well as analysis and identification of future trends, become one of the important and strategic components of a business strategy. We argue that the problems of identifying and predicting trends or entities, as well as the search for technical features, can be solved with the help of easily accessible Big Data technologies, machine learning and predictive analytics, thereby offering an effective plan for development and progress. The purpose of this study is twofold, the first is an identification of technological trends, the second is an identification of application areas and/or that are most promising in terms of technology development and investment. The research was based on methods of clustering, processing of large text files and search queries in patent databases. The suggested approach is considered on the basis of experimental data in the field of moving connected UAVs and passive acoustic ecology control.",
