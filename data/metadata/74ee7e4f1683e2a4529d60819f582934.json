  "title": "Empirical Analysis of the Multiple Factors of Industrial Stock Returns",
  "abstract": "This paper studies the performance of profitability and investment between five different sectors (excluding the financial sector) in the Shanghai stock market. Using the cross-sectional regression approach of Fama and MacBeth (1973), we find that there are significant positive profitability effects in the industrial and commercial sectors and positive investment effects in the utility and industrial sectors. Except for the utility sector, there is significant positive size premium everywhere. There is negative value premium in every sector, but the market risk premium is not obvious. Although all three models do not do well, five-factor model does a better job than the FF three-factor model and traditional CAPM when asked to explain the average returns in the different sectors.",
