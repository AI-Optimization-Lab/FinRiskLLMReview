  "title": "Psychosocial Risk Factors for Transitions Into Housing Instability Among Women Veterans",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Preventing and ending homelessness for women veterans, a priority of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), can be aided by identifying factors that increase their risk for housing instability. Methods: This study relied on data from the Veterans Health Administration's universal screen for housing instability from Fiscal Year 2013 to 2016, and administrative data from electronic medical records. Using logistic regression, we compared 2 groups of women veterans: those who consistently had stable housing and those who transitioned to unstable housing after a period of housing stability. Results: We found that a history of military sexual trauma, lack of access to VA benefits and other financial resources, and single or divorced marital status were significant risk factors for women veterans' housing instability. These findings are consistent with an existing theoretical model of housing instability and homelessness among women veterans, which highlights the importance of traumatic and adverse events and isolation as risk factors. Conclusions: These risk factors and their effect on women veterans' housing instability can be mitigated by new and increased supportive interventions, targeted to those at highest risk.",
