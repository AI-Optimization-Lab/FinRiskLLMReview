  "title": "REPORTING ON RISK",
  "abstract": "The importance of the risk management philosophy and practice is increasing largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, what has motivated the specific research on Serbian practices. The paper presents the results of the qualitative field research on risk reporting, conducted in 2016 in Serbia. Through a series of interviews with 17 insurance companies the research examined current practice in risk reporting and the reporting hierarchy and integrity of functions within the enterprise system. Beside filed provided interviews, there were used methods of Multiple Regression Analysis and chi(2). The main results show that the risk shaping in this particular financial sector emerged, that there are various levels of risk reporting exist as well as their interconnections with other functions. The findings suggest that the risk management reporting practices of Serbian insurers are variable, generally behind best practices in adjacent sectors, and in some cases are causes of concern but that they have been improving significantly.",
