  "title": "Financial and Employment Problems in Families of Children With Special Health Care Needs: Implications for Research and Practice",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to financial burden among families of children with special needs and to identify specific provider-level activities associated with decreased risk for such burden. Method: Data for secondary analysis are from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN). Logistic regression analysis of state-level data was conducted to identify significant predictors of financial and employment problems among families of children with SHCN in Minnesota. Results: Children with more severe conditions and whose family members provided health care at home were more likely to have parents report financial and employment problems due to the child's condition. On the other hand, families whose health care providers communicated well with other service providers and who helped them feel like partners in their child's care were significantly less likely to report financial and employment problems. Discussion: Pediatric nurses and nurse practitioners can use these findings as they work with families for optimal family outcomes. Advocacy and policy implications at state and federal levels also are discussed. J Pediatr Health Care. (2009) 23, 117-125.",
