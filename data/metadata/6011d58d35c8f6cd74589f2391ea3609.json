  "title": "Common volatility spillover analysis and empirical study on the financial market",
  "abstract": "It is very important to determine the volatility spillover for the dynamic investment portfolio and risk management. The known literature tends to study whether the volatility spillover exists between two financial markets. However, the common volatility spillover from multiple financial markets to one financial market has not yet been mentioned. With the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and GARCH model, the thesis studies the common volatility spillover from multiple financial markets to one financial market and conducts the empirical analysis.",
