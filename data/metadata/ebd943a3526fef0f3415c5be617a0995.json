  "title": "Research on the influence of financial risk on enterprises' green performance",
  "abstract": "This study theoretically analyzes the causal mechanism of financial risk on enterprise green performance through the influential pathway of green ambidextrous innovation. A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2021 were selected as research samples for regression analysis. The empirical findings indicate that both internal and external financial risks significantly impede enterprise green performance. Internal financial risk hinders enterprise green performance by restraining green ambidextrous innovation, while external financial risk impedes green performance solely by inhibiting exploratory green innovation. The mediating effect of exploitative green innovation was found to be insignificant. The outcomes of this research can provide guidance to enterprises in enhancing their green innovation capabilities and fostering green performance.",
