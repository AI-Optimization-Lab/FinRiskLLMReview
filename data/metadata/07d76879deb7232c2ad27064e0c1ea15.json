  "title": "Risk Analysis of DP Incidents during Drilling Operations",
  "abstract": "This paper aims to present a method to determine the type of dynamic positioning (DP) incidents that have a more significant risk during drilling operations in the period 2007-2015, according to the element or the type of failure that causes the DP system to fail. Two different classifications are made: 1) according to the element that produces the incident (which has been the traditional classification in the industry) and 2) according to the type of error that arises, the latter being an alternative classification proposed in this paper. The predictable financial losses for each level of severity are used to define the resulting consequences for each case. A risk analysis is performed with the data obtained, showing the potentially more dangerous incidents, either because of their higher number of occurrences or because their consequences are remarkable. According to the classification proposed, the main causes with the higher risk results were power and environmental, according to the traditional classification, and fault/failure. Thus, the power segment's combination of failures is the riskiest cause during the DP drilling operations.",
