  "title": "Systemic risk spillovers and the determinants in the stock markets of the Belt and Road countries",
  "abstract": "We construct time-varying tail risk networks to investigate systemic risk spillovers in the Belt and Road (B&R) stock markets during 2008-2021. Network metrics clearly reflect aggregate risk level and individual risk accumulation for the B&R stock markets under extreme events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic). Tail-event driven network quantile regression analysis shows that network impacts of the B&R stock markets under different risk levels are asymmetric and regional heterogeneity. Panel analysis on determinants of systemic risk spillovers shows that cross-border investment and international trade are significant contagion channels while eco-nomic freedom is potential driver.",
