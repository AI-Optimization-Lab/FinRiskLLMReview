  "title": "The analysis and avoidance of real estate financial risks",
  "abstract": "Real estate has become the new increasing economy point of China. The real estate finance is the main support and irreplaceable factor for the real estate. This paper will discuss. the problem of real estate financial risks. Firstly, it will introduce the definition of real estate financial risks and the classification of it. The real estate financial risks include credit risk, fluidness risk, structure of assess and debt risk, interest risk, inflation risk, foreign exchange risk and so on. Secondly, the paper will show the influence, factors of real estate financial risks, including capital factor, substantiality factor, morality factor, mentality risk factor, technical factor, and system risk, etc. Thirdly, the paper will argue a method to measure the risk. Compared with traditional method, the modem risk measurable technique will be advanced. Lastly, the paper discusses the avoidance of real estate financial risk. We give several countermeasures about avoidance of real estate financial risk: increase the percentage of housing mortgage loan rationally, therefore to improve the mode and measure; induct the real estate financial institution competition in good order; push the real estate negotiable securities step by step; utilize the commercial insurance and social guarantee institution; consummate the collection and utilization of housing accumulation funds; settle the badness assess of real estate financial institution.",
