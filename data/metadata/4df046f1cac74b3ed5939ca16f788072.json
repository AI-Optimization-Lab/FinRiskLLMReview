  "title": "Research on College Students' Willingness to Use Internet Financial Products and Its Influencing Factors Based on Factor Analysis and Regression Analysis",
  "abstract": "Based on the sample of college students in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, 208 valid questionnaires were collected through interviews and questionnaires. Factor analysis and regression analysis were used to analyze the factors influencing college students' willingness to use Internet financial products and summarize the use of Internet financial products by college students in Wuhan city. At the same time, according to the research results, this paper puts forward targeted suggestions for the growth of various products, so as to promote the popularization and development of Internet financial products among college students, improve college students' cognition of the characteristics of various Internet financial products, promote college students to deal with the relationship between risk and income, and realize the reasonable allocation of finance.",
