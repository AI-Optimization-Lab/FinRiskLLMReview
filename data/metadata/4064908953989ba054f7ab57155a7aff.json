  "title": "Revenue optimization in Indonesian banking: the role of macroeconomic volatility, credit risk, and liquidity risk in default probability and pricing strategies",
  "abstract": "This study analyzes the impact of credit risk, liquidity risk, and macroeconomic volatility on revenue optimization and risk-based pricing in banking. Using a quantitative econometric approach, including panel data regression, VECM, and the KMV Merton model, the research examines how risk propagation influences pricing strategies and revenue performance. Results show that increased credit risk raises default probability, liquidity constraints affect loan pricing, and macroeconomic volatility requires revenue management adjustments. Risk-based pricing, interest rate adjustments, and asset-liability management are crucial for sustaining profitability. This study contributes to financial stability discourse by integrating risk-based pricing and macroeconomic risk management.",
