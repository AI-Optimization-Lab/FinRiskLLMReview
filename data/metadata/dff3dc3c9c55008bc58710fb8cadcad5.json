  "title": "Evaluation of scenario reduction algorithms with nested distance",
  "abstract": "Multistage stochastic optimization is used to solve many real-life problems where decisions are taken at multiple times. Such problems need the representation of stochastic processes, which are usually approximated by scenario trees. In this article, we implement seven scenario reduction algorithms: three based on random extraction, namedRandom, and four based on specific distance measures, namedDistance-based. Three of the latter are well known in literature while the fourth is a new approach, namely nodal clustering. We compare all the algorithms in terms of computational cost and information cost. The computational cost is measured by the time needed for the reduction, while the information cost is measured by the nested distance between the original and the reduced tree. Moreover, we also formulate and solve a multistage stochastic portfolio selection problem to measure the distance between the optimal solutions and between the optimal objective values of the original and the reduced tree.",
