  "title": "1 plus 1 is more than 2: mental health problems, financial difficulties, and social exclusion in a cross-sectional study of 28,047 general-population adults",
  "abstract": "Background Mental health problems and financial difficulties each increase the risk of social exclusion. However, few large studies representing a broad age range have investigated the combined social effect of having both difficulties. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine associations of mental health problems, financial difficulties, and the combination of both with social exclusion. Methods This analysis was based on responses from 28,047 adults (age > 18 years) from the general population participating in The Norwegian Counties Public Health Survey 2019. Respondents answered questions about their financial situation, mental health problems, and social exclusion. Social exclusion was measured as a lack of social support, low participation in organized social activities, low participation in other activities, missing someone to be with, feeling excluded, and feeling isolated. Adjustments for sex and age were made in multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results Having mental health problems or financial difficulties was associated with various measures of social exclusion (odds ratios [ORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 1.33 [1.23-1.43] to 12.63 [10.90-14.64]). However, the odds of social exclusion strongly increased for respondents who reported a combination of mental health problems and financial difficulties compared with those who did not report either (ORs [CIs]: 2.08 [1.90-2.27] to 29.46 [25.32-34.27]). Conclusions Having the combination of mental health problems and financial difficulties is strongly associated with increased risk for social exclusion, far beyond the effect of either factor alone.",
