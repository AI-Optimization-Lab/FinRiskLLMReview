  "title": "Litigation Risk and Good Corporate Governance on Audit Fees: Moderate Role of Financial Reporting Disclosure Level",
  "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of litigation risk and good corporate governance on fees audit and also to see the effect of the level of financial reporting disclosed as a moderating variable of the manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange by using index litigation for litigation risk variable, for GCG variable by using index GCG, and audit fee by using natural logarithm, and also the level of financial reporting disclosure by using the Index Wallace. The research object as a sample is 165 manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2017 to 2019. The research method uses a panel data regression model to test the research hypothesis. The empirical findings of the study prove that litigation risk positively affects audit fees, while good corporate governance has no effect. The level of financial reporting disclosure which acts as a moderating variable is not able to explain audit fees through litigation risk and good corporate governance. The results of the study imply that the management of litigation risk is important for the company to pay attention to prevent large audit fees.",
