  "title": "The Accounting Early Warning System of China's Petrochemical Public Company Based on The BP neural network",
  "abstract": "The accumulating financial risk of the enterprises is the dominant factor that leading companies to crisis. The main measures to prevent corporate crisis are to enhance the elimination and the management of the financial risk. The early warning of the financial risk is the process which carries out multi-angle analysis of judgments to the likelihood of the corporate financial risk and timely issue the crisis warnings. Based on BP Neural Network Model and the listed company's annual report data, this paper built the financial early warning system of the listed companies in China's petrochemical industry. The results showed that the early warning system of the financial risk constructed in this article has effectively forecast for the financial risk of China's petrochemical industry and the high accuracy.",
