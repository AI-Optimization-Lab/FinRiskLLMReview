  "title": "On Financial Distributions Modelling Methods: Application on Regression Models for Time Series",
  "abstract": "The financial market is a complex system with chaotic behavior that can lead to wild swings within the financial system. This can drive the system into a variety of interesting phenomenon such as phase transitions, bubbles, and crashes, and so on. Of interest in financial modelling is identifying the distribution and the stylized facts of a particular time series, as the distribution and stylized facts can determine if volatility is present, resulting in financial risk and contagion. Regression modelling has been used within this study as a methodology to identify the goodness-of-fit between the original and generated time series model, which serves as a criterion for model selection. Different time series modelling methods that include the common Box-Jenkins ARIMA, ARMA-GARCH type methods, the Geometric Brownian Motion type models and Tsallis entropy based models when data size permits, can use this methodology in model selection. Determining the time series distribution and stylized facts has utility, as the distribution allows for further modelling opportunities such as bivariate regression and copula modelling, apart from the usual forecasting. Determining the distribution and stylized facts also allows for the identification of the parameters that are used within a Geometric Brownian Motion forecasting model. This study has used the Carbon Emissions Futures price between the dates of 1 May 2012 and 1 May 2022, to highlight this application of regression modelling.",
