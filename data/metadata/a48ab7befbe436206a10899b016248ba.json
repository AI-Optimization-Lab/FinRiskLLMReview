  "title": "Empirical study of corporation credit default probability based on Logit model",
  "abstract": "Based on actual data of state-owned commercial banks in China, combining with the corporation financial data, and applying Logit regression model, we empirically analyzed corporate default probability. The result shows that Logit model is an Ideal tool of forecasting corporate default probability, and that the data and techniques are of practical significance to credit rating and risk management of commercial banks.",
