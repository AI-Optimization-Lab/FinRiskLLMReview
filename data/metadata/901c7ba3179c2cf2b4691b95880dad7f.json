  "title": "Digital financial inclusion and SME market dynamics: an empirical analysis based on big data of business registrations in China",
  "abstract": "With the deepening of internet development, digital financial inclusion has gradually become a crucial force in promoting the market entry of small and micro enterprises (SMEs). This study analyzes the impact of digital financial inclusion on SME market dynamics, using big data of business registrations and digital financial inclusion data of 268 cities in China from 2011 to 2017. Employing two-way fixed effects and instrumental variable regression methods, we find that digital financial inclusion significantly facilitates SME market entrance and reduces exiting risk. Moreover, the level of internet development moderates the impact of digital financial inclusion, with regions having high internet coverage showing a stronger effect in promoting entry; while regions with low internet coverage exhibit a more pronounced effect in reducing exiting. Further heterogeneity analysis suggests that the impact of digital financial inclusion primarily reveals with the breadth of coverage and depth of use. The effects are more significant in regions with high levels of innovation and foreign investment. This paper provides new empirical evidence on the role of digital financial inclusion in SME development and proposes relevant policy recommendations to promote sustainable development for SMEs.",
