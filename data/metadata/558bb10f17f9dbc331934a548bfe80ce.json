  "title": "The Confrontation of Two Clustering Methods in Portfolio Management: Ward's Method Versus DCA Method",
  "abstract": "This paper presents a new methodology to cluster asset in the portfolio theory. This new methodology is compare with the classical ward cluster in SAS software. The method is based on DCA (Difference of Convex functions), an innovative approach in nonconvex optimization framework which has been successfully used on various industrial complex systems. The cluster can be used in an empirical example in the context of multi-managers portfolio management, and to identify the one that seems to best fit the objectives of portfolio management of a fund of funds or funds. The cluster is useful to reduce the choice of asset class and to facilitate the optimization of Markowitz frontier.",
