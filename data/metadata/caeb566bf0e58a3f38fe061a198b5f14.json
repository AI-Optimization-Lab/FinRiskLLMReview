  "title": "Inadequate fruit and vegetable intake in people with psychosis",
  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with poor dietary intake (less than four servings of fruit and vegetables daily) in a large nationally representative sample of adults with psychotic disorders. Methods: The sample comprised 1286 adults aged 18-64 years who took part in the second Australian national survey of psychosis. Dietary information was obtained using a standardised questionnaire; all participants provided fasting blood samples. Variables that may be related to diet and nutritional intake were investigated; these included demographics, physical health outcomes, physical activity, substance use, symptom severity and financial difficulty. Dietary status was explored by sex, age and body mass index using univariate analyses, while a multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of low nutritional intake. Results: Approximately 74% of participants ate less than four servings of fruit and vegetables daily. This was associated with a lower body mass index (p",
