  "title": "Sparse estimation within Pearson's system, with an application to financial market risk",
  "abstract": "Pearson's system is a rich class of models that includes many classical univariate distributions. It comprises all continuous densities whose logarithmic derivative can be expressed as a ratio of quadratic polynomials governed by a vector beta of coefficients. The estimation of a Pearson density is challenging, as small variations in beta can induce wild changes in the shape of the corresponding density f beta. The authors show how to estimate beta and f beta effectively through a penalized likelihood procedure involving differential regularization. The approach combines a penalized regression method and a profiled estimation technique. Simulations and an illustration with S & P 500 data suggest that the proposed method can improve market risk assessment substantially through value-at-risk and expected shortfall estimates that outperform those currently used by financial institutions and regulators.",
