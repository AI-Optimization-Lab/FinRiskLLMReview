  "title": "The Study of Mobile E-portfolio Architecture",
  "abstract": "The goal of this study is to improve the management and data update of traditional learning portfolio. Learning portfolio can be classified into two types: process portfolio and product portfolio. Traditional learning portfolio has difficulties on storage, management, information standardization, etc. E-portfolio solves partial problems of traditional learning portfolio. However, for the present application of e-portfolio, most learners use product portfolio, a passive portfolio. Active learning portfolio which can record students' learning process such as class attendance, activity participation or library record which are classified as real-time data is less explored. Thus, this study hopes to achieve the goal through combining cloud network with mobile devices with camera.",
