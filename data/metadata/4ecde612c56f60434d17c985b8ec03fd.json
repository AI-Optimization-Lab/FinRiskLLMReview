  "title": "Impact of collaborative, entrepreneurship education on the financial risk taken by university students",
  "abstract": "Based on the definition of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs can be considered as risk-takers. The literature contains conflicting theories as to whether risk-taking can be influenced by external factors. The current paper investigates the effect of entrepreneurship education and collaborative environment on financial risk-taking behavior among university-age young people. To this end, an online survey was conducted involving 510 participants and various statistical tests were utilized to test the research hypothesis. To measure financial risk-taking propensity, the Choice Dilemma Questionnaire methodology was implemented. The results of the analysis reveal that both the level of entrepreneurship education and a collaborative environment increase financial risk-taking. Moreover, multiple linear regression methodology was used to capture the significant factors that influence financial risk-taking when investing alone and investing in a collaborative environment. As a policy recommendation, the authors suggest that an entrepreneurship training curriculum should be developed that incorporates the various activities and elements of a collaborative environment.",
