  "title": "A regularization approach to continuous learning with an application to financial derivatives pricing",
  "abstract": "We consider the training of neural networks in cases where the nonlinear relationship of interest gradually changes over time. One possibility to deal with this problem is by regularization where a variation penalty is added to the usual mean squared error criterion. To learn the regularized network weights we suggest the Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) as a learning rule, which may be derived from a Bayesian perspective on the regularization problem. A primary application of our algorithm is in financial derivatives pricing, where neural networks may be used to model the dependency of the derivatives' price on one or several underlying assets. After giving a brief introduction to the problem of derivatives pricing we present experiments with German stock index options data showing that a regularized neural network trained with the IEKF outperforms several benchmark models and alternative learning procedures. In particular, the performance may be greatly improved using a newly designed neural network architecture that accounts for no-arbitrage pricing restrictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
