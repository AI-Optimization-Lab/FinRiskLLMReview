  "title": "Integral risk evaluation and control model for enterprise group",
  "abstract": "For a large enterprise group with many subordinate companies running different businesses, its integral risk is composed of the risks of all the companies. A regression model is set up according to Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to assess the risk coefficient of every company, the expectation profit rate of the debt capital of the enterprise group and of its owned capital. By adopting the portfolio theory, the integral risk of the enterprise group is assessed and controlled in order to reduce it as possible, providing a reference criterion for working out the group's development strategy. The paper explains the calculating method by using an example.",
