  "title": "Statistical arbitrage models of the FTSE 100",
  "abstract": "In this paper we describe a set of statistical arbitrage models which exploit relative value relationships amongst the constituents of the FTSE 100. Rather than estimating cointegration vectors of high dimensionality, a stepwise regression approach is used to identify the most appropriate subspace for the stochastic detrending of each individual equity price. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to identify the empirical distribution of the Variance Ratio profile of the regression residuals, under the null hypothesis of random walk behaviour. Both a chi-squared test on the joint distribution of the Variance Ratio profile, and additional tests based on its eigenvectors, indicate that as a whole the stochastically detrended stock prices deviate significantly from random walk behaviour and hence may contain predictable components. A combined cross-sectional and time-series model indicates that the relative mispricing of the equities tends to tread in the short-term and revert in the longer term. The out-of-sample performance of the models is consistently profitable using a simple trading rule, with the combined portfolio suggesting a possible annualised Sharpe Ratio of over 7 for a trader with costs of 50 basis points. Furthermore, information derived from the in-sample variance ratio profile is shown to be significantly correlated with the out-of-sample profitability of the individual models-suggesting that the performance may be improved further by modelling the time-series properties conditionally on such information.",
