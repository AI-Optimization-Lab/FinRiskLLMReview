  "title": "Where do We Go: New Evidence for China's Bank in the Middle East",
  "abstract": "The Middle East has become a new investment highlight for China's banking sector in recent years. One of the key issues is to identify the most suitable countries in the above region. This paper tries to analyze it by using the clustering method and the data from 2012 to 2014. Six variables are employed including the trade volume, outward FDI, GDP per capita, GDP, Global Financial Center Ranking and political risk The results show that 19 sample countries can be classified into four categories: The united Arab emirates and Saudi Arabia are the most preferred regions, suitable for following customers and seeking local profitability. Four rich countries including Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Israel are suitable for trade relations. Five big countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Algeria are also suitable for following the customers. Syria and other 7 countries are not suitable for outward investment at present.",
