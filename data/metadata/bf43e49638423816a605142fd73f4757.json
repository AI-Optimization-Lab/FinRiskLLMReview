  "title": "Factors Associated With Not Returning to Work Among Breast Cancer Survivors",
  "abstract": "Background: Returning to work (RTW) is a crucial aspect of recovery for patients with breast cancer (BC), which indicates restored normalcy, financial stability, functional abilities, and an improved quality of life. However, associated factors related to not RTW among patients with BC remain unclear. In this study, we examined associated factors of not RTW among patients with BC.Methods: A cross-sectional study and convenience sampling were conducted in two hospitals in Indonesia to recruit eligible participants. Factors related to not RTW were collected and included symptoms of distress, loneliness, anxiety/depression, perceived social support, and frailty. A logistic regression model was performed to explore associated factors of not RTW.Findings: In total, 250 patients with BC were included in this study, and 148 of them experienced not RTW. Anxiety, loneliness, frailty, and social support emerged as significant factors associated with not RTW. BC patients who had a higher anxiety level (odds ratio [OR]: 5.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.16, 12.98]), had high loneliness (OR: 3.15, 95% CI [1.29, 7.67]), or were frail (OR: 2.53; 95% CI [1.07, 5.98]) had a higher risk of not RTW. BC patients with lower social support (OR: 5.65; 95% CI [1.81, 17.63]) had a higher risk of not RTW.Conclusion/Applications to Practice: Occupational health professionals can offer early counseling, health education, and support strategies to patients with BC, assisting their preparations in terms of both physical and psychological functions for successfully RTW.",
