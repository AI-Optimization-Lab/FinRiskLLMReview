  "title": "Non-Performing Loans in the Czech Republic: Lag Structure Identification of the Macroeconomic Determinants",
  "abstract": "In recent years, mainly as a result of the financial crisis, the interest in the macroprudential policy and its role as a part of reformed regulatory framework has been rising. Problems in the financial (banking) system may occur if systemic risks, especially credit risk, are not properly managed. In this situation, the financial instability/crisis has a large negative impact on economic activity. Non-performing loans (NPLs) are one of the commonly used indicators of credit risk which, at the system level, show cyclical behavior. The aim of this paper is to identify the structure of time lags of the most important macroeconomic determinants of non-performing loans in the Czech Republic using a linear regression model. The main determinants of NPLs used in the model are its lagged value, real economic growth, inflation, exchange rate and lending rates. Estimation results suggest that non-performing loans are medium persistent and that the lag length of its main determinants ranges from two to seven quarters.",
