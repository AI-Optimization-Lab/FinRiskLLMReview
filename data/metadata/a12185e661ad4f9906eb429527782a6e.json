  "title": "Diving patterns and decompression sickness among South Korean fishery divers",
  "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to report the characteristics of diving practice and the incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among South Korean fishery divers. Methods: We sent out questionnaires to 215 registered boat owners, and 196 of the fishery divers responded. The questionnaire was comprised of demographical characteristics, diving-related characteristics, and experiences with DCS. DCS was classified into types I and II based on the symptoms. Results: Their average length of career in fishery diving was 18.1 +/- 8.5 years. They were working for 10.8 +/- 1.9 months per year. The average bottom time was 74.7 +/- 23.3 minutes, the average depth was 23.6 +/- 6.8 m, and the average surface interval time was 20.7 +/- 12.5 minutes. The incidence of DCS symptoms among the total participants was 84.7%. The incidence increased as working days per month and dives per day increased (P < 0.05). An increased average working depth and a short surface interval time tended to reflect an elevated incidence in the DCS symptoms (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed working days per month, dives per day, average bottom time, and rapid ascent as risk factors (P < 0.05). Conclusions: South Korean fishery divers were shown to be susceptible to DCS because of their repetitive dives for financial reasons. However, they are often beyond the scope of the law. The results of this study suggested that it is necessary to establish the registries of fishery divers.",
