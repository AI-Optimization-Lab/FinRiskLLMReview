  "title": "Study on Rural Financial Supervision under the New Rural Financial Pattern in China",
  "abstract": "With the relaxation of the rural financial market access policy, there have been three kinds of new rural financial institutions set up successively, including banks of villages and small towns, loan company and fund mutual cooperatives. The establishment of new rural financial institutions has not only brought competition and vitality for the rural financial market, but also posed new challenges for China's rural financial supervision at the same time. The paper takes new access mechanism of rural financial market as the background, making use of systematic theory method to probe into the problems existing in rural financial supervision under the new rural financial pattern, further putting forward the suggestions of setting up scientific and effective rural financial supervisory system, and the suggestions are that constructing the plural supervisory system, constructing the government-led cooperation system of financial supervision, setting up the new supervisory idea, improving the way of financial supervision, fulfilling the way of classification supervision and risk supervision.",
