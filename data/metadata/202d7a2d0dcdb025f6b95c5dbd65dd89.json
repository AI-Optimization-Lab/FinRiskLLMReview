  "title": "Financial integration and consumption risk sharing and smoothing",
  "abstract": "While paying careful attention to the stochastic properties of income process, this paper tests the joint rational expectation and permanent income hypothesis (RE/PIH) to clarify how and to what degree financial integration delinks national income and consumption. It is shown that both the OECD and the non-OECD countries benefit from financial integration in terms of consumption risk sharing and smoothing. The RE/NH for the transitory income is not rejected for the OECD countries suggesting full consumption smoothing. Regression results also support the RE/PIH prediction that financial integration delivers even larger increases in consumption responding to positive shocks to income growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
