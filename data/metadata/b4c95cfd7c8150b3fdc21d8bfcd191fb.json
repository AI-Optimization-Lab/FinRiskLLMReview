  "title": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGERIAN LISTED BANKS",
  "abstract": "The relationship between the risk management practices and financial performance of the listed companies in Nigeria was examined in this study with a particular attention on the 21 deposit money banks for the period of ten year from 2005 to 2014. Specifically, the study investigated how risk limit setting, risk adherence monitoring, risk policy review, credit risk management, operational risk management and market risk management has impacted the financial performance of listed banks in Nigeria. The study used both the primary (survey questionnaire) and secondary (audited financial statement) as sources of data. Although, the study used both descriptive and inferential statistic, the strength of the relationship between the variable was established with ordinary least square regression analysis after satisfying all the OLS assumptions. The overall results revealed that risk management practices have statistically significant impact on financial performance and thus leading to a recommendation that adequate risk management system should be put in place by the board of directors which should include the establishment of company's annual risk limit, risk appetite and risk strategy to curtail the excessive risk taking of the management. This system should be reviewed regularly to determine its adequacy, effectiveness and compliance level of the management with this risk management system.",
