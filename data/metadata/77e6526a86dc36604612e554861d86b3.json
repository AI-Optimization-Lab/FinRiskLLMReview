  "title": "The Model and Application of the Investment Risk Comprehensive Evaluation about the Electric Power Project Based on BP Neural Network",
  "abstract": "The power projects face the uncertain external environment, they are complex of the projects themselves and the capabilities of the designers, erectors and operator are limited, which make the risk indicators of the power projects investment are extremely complicated, including financial risk, technology risk, production risk, market risk, management risk and environmental risk. In order to evaluate the risk investment projects scientifically and accurately, according to the principle of BP neural network, this paper proposes the BP neural network model for the risk evaluation of the power project investment. The model not only can simulate the expert in evaluating the investing risk, but also avoid the subjective mistakes in the evaluation process. The investment risk evaluation of 16 power projects in National Power Company shows that the results given by this model are reliable, and this method to forecast the power project investment risk is feasible.",
