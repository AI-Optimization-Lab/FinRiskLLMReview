  "title": "Financial assets and happiness: evidence from the China Household Finance Survey",
  "abstract": "Using the China Household Finance Survey Data, this article studies the effect of financial assets on happiness. The empirical results based on a series of regression models show that (1) household financial assets have a significant impact on individual's happiness; (2) the effect of different types of financial assets on happiness is heterogeneous and having certificates of deposit has a positive impact on happiness whilst holding stocks will significantly reduce individual's happiness; (3) the value of certificates of deposit has certainly improved happiness, whilst the value of holding stocks, funds, has no significant effect and (4) the relationship between the value of certificates of deposit and happiness varies with a household income level, but not risk attitude.",
