  "title": "Factors impacting early cochlear implantation in Chinese children",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the factors that impact early cochlear implantation (CI) in Chinese children. The charts of 56 pediatric cochlear implant recipients were retrospectively reviewed. Parental interviews were conducted to collect information regarding the factors that potentially impact early CI in Chinese children. The mean age at CI was 40.98 months, and the median age was 24 months. Thirty patients received an implant before 24 months of age, and the other 26 patients received the implant after 24 months of age. By univariate logistic regression analysis, newborn hearing screening (NHS), financial burden impacted early CI significantly (p < 0.05), while the multivariate analysis indicated that only NHS significantly influenced the early CI (p < 0.05). The following factors were associated with a moderately increased risk of late implantation: lack of NHS [odds ratio (OR) = 5.833], living in a rural community (OR = 2.714), and communication barriers (OR = 2.691). Living in a rural community, financial burden and communication barriers negatively impact the age at CI, whereas NHS positively influence the age at CI. Increased awareness of these factors could promote early CI and improve the quality of life of congenitally deaf children.",
