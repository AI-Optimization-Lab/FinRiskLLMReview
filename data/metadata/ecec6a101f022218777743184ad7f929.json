  "title": "A New Method for Portfolio Construction Using a Deep Predictive Model",
  "abstract": "A well-designed portfolio plays a key role in achieving investment goal. In this paper, we use Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Units, to predict potential returns of a collection of investments. Then, we construct diversified portfolios by giving thresholds for the potential returns and examine the return and risk levels of the portfolios. These results show conclusively that it is possible to build a portfolio given a desired degree of return and risk by adjusting the thresholds, which is promising in asset allocations reflected investors' risk preference.",
