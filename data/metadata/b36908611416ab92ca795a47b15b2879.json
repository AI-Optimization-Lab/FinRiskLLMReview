  "title": "Credit Risk Assessment: A Nonlinear Multi-parameter Model",
  "abstract": "Modern credit risk management aims at assess the default probability (DP) of a debtor according to his historical and current financial data. Due to its prominent importance in credit loan decisions, the DP assessment becomes a research focus in the riled of financial data mining. To tackle this problem, we propose a nonlinear multi-parameter model (NMM) based on domain knowledge. Additionally, the parameters of the model are estimated using one of recent evolutionary algorithm - differential evolution (DE). In the experiment, real-world financial data is utilized to test the performance of NMM. Experimental results reveal that NMM performs much better than back-propagation neural network (BPNN).",
