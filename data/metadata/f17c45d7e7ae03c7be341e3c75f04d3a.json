  "title": "Management of the Investment Design Process at the Enterprises of the Energy Sector",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to form a scientifically-based mechanism for managing investment design at the enterprises of the energy sector. In the paper, an organizational model of investment design is developed, an algorithm for the formation and management of a portfolio of energy-saving projects is compiled, the degree of probability of transition of enterprises to resource-and energy-saving technologies is assessed. The conducted studies are based on the system analysis method, process and project approaches, methods of comparison and generalization, classification, expert assessments, modeling, and investment planning. The formulated provisions, conclusions and recommendations can be used by investors in choosing the most acceptable objects for investing their own funds in terms of risk cost.",
