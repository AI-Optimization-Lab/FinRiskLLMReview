  "title": "An Empirical Study of the GEM Listing Factors Affecting Cash Dividend",
  "abstract": "since 2009,GEM was officially listed in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.The number of listed companies has been developed from initial 28 to 356.Although the GEM exists short, the GEM companies with high cash dividend phenomenon is prominent in recent year.The paper selects data from 2012,and uses multiple linear regression method to explain the phenomenon of high-dividend intrinsic factors from ownership structure and financial analysis.Study found that companies listed on GEM have been affected significantly on net profit growth,asset-liability ratio, net assets-net profit margin and enterprise scale,while the total level of risk,cash flow available for distribution and quick ratio effect in no significant way.",
