  "title": "FACTS, FIGURES AND INTEGRATION OF BIOREFINERIES IN A FUTURE BIOECONOMY - FINDINGS IN IEA BIOENERGY TASK 42 BIOREFINING",
  "abstract": "A key driver for the necessary sustainable development is the implementation of the BioEconomy, which is based on renewable resources to satisfy its energy and material demand of our society. The broad spectrum of biomass resources offers great opportunities for a comprehensive product portfolio to satisfy the different needs of a BioEconomy. The concept of biorefining guarantees the resource and energy efficient use of biomass resources. The IEA Bioenergy Task 42 Biorefining has the following definition on biorefinery: Biorefining is the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, and materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat). Currently many different biorefinery concepts are developed and already implemented which play a key role in establishing a BioEconomy. The purpose of the work is to provide facts and figures on different biorefinery systems and their efficient integration in existing industrial infrastructure. This information assists industry, decision makers and investors in their strategies to invest and integrate resource efficient biomass uses in the infrastructure of a future BioEconomy. Based on the activities of the 11 participating countries (A, AUS, CA, DK, FR, G, I, J, NL, US) the IEA Task 42 identified and assessed the current status and development potential of  energy-driven biorefineries and product-driven biorefineries. The 14 most interesting energy-driven biorefinery concepts until 2025 and their value chains, including the integration and deployment options in industrial infrastructures, are analyzed. Based on the developed Biorefinery Fact Sheet for the most relevant biorefineries the sustainable and efficient integration of biorefineries in existing and future infrastructure is examined. The possible role of biorefineries in a BioEconomy is analyzed in a regional, national and international context. The classification and description of existing infrastructure in combination with the available biomass resources and (future) market needs shows the matching points for a resource efficient roll out of the BioEconomy by implementing various biorefineries. Examples for identified hot spots by coproducing high value products like food, feed, biochemicals and biomaterials are: 1) pulp&paper and wood industry to additionally produce transportation biofuels and biochemicals; 2) food&feed industry to additionally produce bioenergy carriers, 2) chemical industry to integrate biogenic resources to produce biobased chemicals. The results assist various stakeholders in finding their position on biorefining in a future biobased economy while minimizing unexpected technical, economic and financial risks.",
