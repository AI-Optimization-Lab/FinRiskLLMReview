  "title": "Policy Feedback, Energy Equity, and Climate Justice: Can Existing Policies Improve Solar Access for Low- and Moderate-Income Communities in the United States?",
  "abstract": "Despite the proliferation of rooftop solar in the United States, its deployment and associated benefits have not been distributed equitably. Many states have adopted targeted incentives to improve access to rooftop solar and increase its uptake among low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. This article examines the policy feedback effects of energy efficiency policies and electricity-sector portfolio standards on the adoption and diffusion of LMI solar incentives across states. Event History Analyses indicate that between 2010 and 2019, the adoption and diffusion of the incentives have been conditional on a state's portfolio standards but independent of energy efficiency policies. Feedback effects from the portfolio standards in neighboring states are found to have a regressive impact on the likelihood of adoption. Hence, the feedback effects of previously adopted renewable energy policies are helping states to better serve vulnerable communities. However, there is no evidence of geographic clustering in the diffusion of incentives.",
