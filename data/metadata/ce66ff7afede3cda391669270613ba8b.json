  "title": "The effectiveness of drought risk management strategies in western Iran",
  "abstract": "In recent decades, many areas of the world have been affected by drought and suffered enormous losses. Although crisis management is necessary, it seems inadequate. Hereupon, risk management and a proactive approach are being emphasized in dealing with this phenomenon. Kermanshah Province in western Iran is also exposed to frequent droughts due to its location in semi-arid regions and therefore adoption of Drought Risk Management Strategies (DRMS) is inevitable. This study is conducted to identify farmers' DRMS and their determinants in four villages of the mentioned province. Strategies were prioritized using mean and standard deviation. The difference between villages in terms of DRMS was determined by ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc tests. The determinants of DRMS adoption were studied utilizing linear regression. The results suggested that farmers prefer inexpensive DRMS to capital intensive ones. In the case of adopting the latter strategies, the number of livestock units, second job, and irrigated land area was the most effective factors respectively. In contrast, the income dependency on agriculture, second job, and educational level were the most effective variables for acceptance of inexpensive strategies, respectively. The second job in both groups of strategies and the educational level in inexpensive strategies had a negative impact on the adoption of strategies. The findings may have a considerable contribution to the appropriate policy-making of DRMS in the world, especially in developing countries. These countries, in addition to mitigating structural, organizational, technological, and financial barriers to advanced DRMS, can develop low-cost DRMS for small farms and poor farmers.",
