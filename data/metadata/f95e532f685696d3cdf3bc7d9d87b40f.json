  "title": "Healthcare affordability and effects on mortality among adults with liver disease from 2004 to 2018 in the United States",
  "abstract": "Background & Aims:Liver disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, likely incurring financial distress (i.e. healthcare affordability and accessibility issues), although long-term national-level data are limited. Methods:Using the National Health Interview Survey from 2004 to 2018, we categorised adults based on report of liver disease and other chronic conditions linked to mortality data from the National Death Index. We estimated age-adjusted proportions of adults reporting healthcare affordability and accessibility issues. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression were used to assess the association of liver disease with financial distress and financial distress with all-cause mortality, respectively. Results:Among adults with liver disease (n = 19,407) vs. those without liver disease (n = 996,352), those with cancer history (n = 37,225), those with emphysema (n = 7,937), and those with coronary artery disease (n = 21,510), the age-adjusted proportion reporting healthcare affordability issues for medical services was 29.9% (95% CI 29.7-30.1%) vs. 18.1% (95% CI 18.0-18.3%), 26.5% (95% CI 26.3-26.7%), 42.2% (95% CI 42.1-42.4%), and 31.6% (31.5-31.8%), respectively, and for medications: 15.5% (95% CI 15.4-15.6%) vs. 8.2% (95% CI 8.1-8.3%), 14.8% (95% CI 14.7-14.9%), 26.1% (95% CI 26.0-26.2%), and 20.6% (95% CI 20.5-20.7%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, liver disease (vs. without liver disease, vs. cancer history, vs. emphysema, and vs. coronary artery disease) was associated with inability to afford medical services (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.77-1.92; aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.25-1.40; aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98; and aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19, respectively) and medications (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.82-2.03; aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14-1.33; aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90; and aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02, respectively), delays in medical care (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.69-1.87; aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.22; aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97; and aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.14, respectively), and not receiving the needed medical care (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.76-1.96; aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.26; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99; aOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.16, respectively). In multivariable analysis, among adults with liver disease, financial distress (vs. without financial distress) was associated with increased all-cause mortality (aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.53). Conclusions:Adults with liver disease face greater financial distress than adults without liver disease and adults with cancer history. Financial distress is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality among adults with liver disease. Interventions to improve healthcare affordability should be prioritised in this population. & COPY; 2023 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.
