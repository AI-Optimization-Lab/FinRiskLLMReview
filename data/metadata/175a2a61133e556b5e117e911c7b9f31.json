  "title": "Attribute reduction method for predicting Chinese companie's financial failure risk",
  "abstract": "It is important to predict financial failure risk in the changing Chinese economic environment. This paper proposes a novel genetic algorithm-based attribute reduction approach to improve performance of financial failure prediction model. The proposed approach is proved to outperform the exiting statistical methods in that it can achieve smaller attribute subsets with respect to support vector machine and higher accuracy.",
