  "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY This study aims to examine the responsiveness of out of pocket (OOP) healthcare spending to macroeconomic factors, as well to tax-based, compulsory-social health insurance (SHI), mixed health systems and Private Health Insurance (PHI) financing, by elaborating fixed-random effects and dynamic panel data methodology to a dataset of 49 European and OECD countries over the period of 2000 to 2015. RATIONALE Enhancing knowledge about the potential impact of several macroeconomic and health financing factors on OOP healthcare expenditures is an important tool for policy-makers, when designing national health systems reforms aiming at accelerating financial protection towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). So far, the recent financial crisis and its deep fiscal recession for several European and OECD countries, provide an opportunity for further empirical examination concerning the potential effect of public and private pre-paid financing schemes on OOP spending. Previous empirical work has already well documented the responsiveness of OOP healthcare payments to a multitude of explanatory macroeconomic parameters (e.g. GDP, government debt, unemployment) and health financing disaggregated components (e.g. aggregate public and PHI funding) (Grigorakis et al., 2018; Younsi et al., 2016; Fan and Savedoff, 2014; Keegan et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2011; Clemente et al., 2004; Musgrove et al., 2002). Nevertheless, there is no empirical consensus on the effect of macroeconomy, the existence of different public health systems arrangements associated with the voluntary PHI institution funding on OOP expenditure, by using a large sample of countries. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Health financing objective is to provide equitable access of population to needed healthcare alongside with ensuring efficient safe-nets against the risk of financial hardship (WHO, 2008). Offsetting high households' OOP payments as a result of seeking care is regarded by the World Health Assembly (WHA) as a core indicator of health systems performance assessment (WHA, 2011). The concept of financial protection implies to health systems to ensure risk pooling among the population in order to reduce the reliance on OOP spending and thus to diminish households' exposure to financial hardship due to health care use (Saksena et al., 2014; Moreno-Serra et al., 2011). WHO's, WHA's and United Nations' health financing agenda suggest that countries have to promote financial protection against OOP payments for healthcare. Nevertheless, government decision making in several European and OECD countries proceeded on fiscal stability measures rather than ensuring state health funding post to the 2008 crisis era (WHO and World Bank, 2017; WHA, 2011). Health systems worldwide make remarkable progress towards UHC by raising the share of domestic general government health expenditure (GGHE-D) in their current health expenditure (CHE). At the same time countries' reliance on OOP healthcare payments follows a downward trend (Xu et al., 2018). According to WHO's official database (WHO, 2019), public health spending corresponds almost to an average of 52% of per country CHE, whereas 32% derives from OOP payments in 2015, respectively. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of households' financial hardship, catastrophe or even impoverishment due to OOP healthcare spending is borderless, irrespective of region or national income level classification (Wagstaff et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2003). Given that the majority of population in European and OECD countries is compulsorily or privately health insurance covered, the reasonable situation that everyone should expect is OOP payments to be accounted for low proportion to CHE. Nevertheless, OOP payments over the time range from 25% to almost 50% of CHE for several European and OECD economies, such as Cyprus, Bulgaria, Chile, Greece, Hungary, Korea Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Portugal and Spain (WHO, 2019). METHODOLOGY We elaborate both fixed and random effects, as well as dynamic panel data methodology to examine several macroeconomic and different health systems financing arrangements associated with OOP expenditures, using data for 49 European and OECD countries from 2000 to 2015. Our analysis uses annual data for several explanatory variables that have been evinced by the existing literature to have a statistically significant impact on determining OOP spending, gathered from three international databases (IMF, 2019; World Bank, 2019a; WHO, 2019). To the best of our knowledge, there is no an empirical study for examining the potential responsiveness of OOP expenditure to our proposed explanatory parameters nearly to the majority of European and OECD countries based on WHO's region taxonomy. Against this empirical background, we assess the effect of macroeconomy, as well of different national health systems and PHI financing on OOP healthcare spending, for countries with population 1.52 billion (World Bank, 2019b).",
