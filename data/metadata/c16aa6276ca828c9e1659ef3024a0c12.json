  "title": "Gender disparities among United States academic pediatric ophthalmologists: an analysis of publication productivity, academic rank, and NIH funding",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE To investigate gender disparitie among pediatric ophthalmologists in academic rank, publication productivity, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. METHODS In this cross-sectional analysis of pediatric ophthalmologists at 113 US academic programs, data on gender, residency graduation year, and academic rank were obtained from institutional websites between January 2019 and March 2019. The Scopus database was used to calculate h-indices and m-quotients. The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool was used to determine NIH funding. RESULTS We identified 389 pediatric ophthalmologists: 194 women (49.9%) and 195 men (50.1%). A binomial logistic regression model, which included career length as an independent variable, showed proportions of women to men were similar across all academic ranks (assistant professor, 64.4% vs 46.2% [P = 0.738]; associate professor, 21.7% vs 19.0% [P = 0.357]; full professor, 13.9 vs 34.9%[P = 0.119]). Women had a lower median h-index (5.0 vs 8.0 [P = 0.008]) and a shorter median career duration (12.5 vs 25.0 years [P < 0.001]), but a similar median m-quotient (0.5 vs. 0.5; P = 0.525). Among pediatric ophthalmologists who received NIH funding (20 women vs. 27 men; P = 0.826), the overall median grant-funding total for women was $804K (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0M, mean $3.8M) compared to men, $2.2M (IQR, 4.0M; mean, $3.7M; P = 0.328). CONCLUSIONS The shorter career duration for women likely contributes to the difference in overall h-indices between genders, as m-quotients were similar. The m-quotient should be used over the h-index when comparing academic productivity across genders when disparities in career length exist.",
