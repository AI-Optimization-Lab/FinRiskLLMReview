  "title": "On the probability of default in a market with price clustering and jump risk",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the probability of default for financial variables under a tractable stochastic model which can capture both the price clustering phenomenon and the jump risk. We assume that the logarithm of the price dynamics is driven by a so-called sticky double exponential jump diffusion process. In particular, the price clustering is incorporated by time changing the jump diffusion process, and the jump risk is described through a Poisson stochastic integral related to the compound Poisson process with double exponential jumps. Under such a model, we study the default events in the structural credit risk framework. The explicit solutions of Laplace transforms associated with default times are obtained. Based on the derived results, we numerically analyze the effects of the price clustering and the jump risk on the distributions of default times and on the bond's credit spreads.",
