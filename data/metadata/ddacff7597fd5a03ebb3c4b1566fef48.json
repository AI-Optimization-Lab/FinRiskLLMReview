  "title": "Analysis on the Demands and Supplies of Rural Micro-Life Insurance in China",
  "abstract": "Rural micro life insurance is an affordable insurance for rural low -income groups. The development of the insurance offer government a financial method which, by using the market mechanism, can strengthen the economic security of the low-income groups. The supply of rural micro-insurance helps, to enhance self-protection ability of the low-income groups, to build and improve a harmonious social security mechanism, to improve the rural financial system. This is the purpose of our study. The essay can be divided into four parts. Part I, we introduce the domestic and international research literature and the development of Chinese rural micro insurance. We evaluate the research result from the demand factors and empirical survey analysis mode of operation external environment construction. We also give a description to the try outs and development status of rural micro life insurance. Part II, Analysis on the demands of micro life insurance. We analysis the demand factors of micro life insurance by using the social questionnaire and quantitative method. We got 453 questionnaire from the farmers of shandong, hebei and tianjin county. Data processing results show that there is disparity between the potential demand and the real demand. Then we use the Logistic regression to examine whether the factor like the level of income, age, educational level, whether or not have commercial insurance and the level of the willingness to pay premium, have a significant association with the rusult. Our result suggests that the first four factors have a significant association of 90% with the rusult ,howerer,the last is not significant to the demand. PartIII, Analysis on the supplies of micro life insurance. We introduce the present situation of the incurance supply and point out that the supply of the micro life insurance is a breakthrough which adjusts the limitation of the traditional insurable by using the homogeneous risk, stratification of consideration, low rate method ,which has the combination function of commercial insurance and social insurance. We analysis the advantages and disadvantages of the three operation mode,point out the problems in operation. Then we puts forward that Government support, business operations,diversified,broad coverage is a better way to supply micro life insurance. We also analysis the economic and empirical feasibility. Part IV,Suggestions to the development of the demands and supplies of micro life insurance. First develop the demand of rural insurance, second strengthen government policy support, third clear the function of commercial insurance company in the supply of the micro life insurance,fourth promote the managements level of the commercial insurance company in micro life insurance, last promote the prodution design and the sales channel.",
