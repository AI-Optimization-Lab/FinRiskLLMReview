  "title": "Empirical Study on Influencing Factors of China's Quasi-municipal Bonds",
  "abstract": "The characteristic of Chengtou Bond is ambiguous which can be clarified as municipal bond or enterprise bond. In reality there are several classification standards for identifying Chengtou bond, and criteria from WIND is most widely used. Most research found the issuer's financial ratios don't affect the yield spread. Theoretically the indicators for evaluating local governments' credit risk should affect the spread, however there isn't empirical evidence yet. After the announcement of new regulation for Chengtou bond in 2014, identifying Chengtou bond most probably classified as local government's debt has attracted more attention. More evidence show that WIND criteria are too broad, while criteria from China banking regulatory commission (CBRC) are more conservative. In this paper, the Data from CBRC between 2008 and 2013 are used, and the empirical evidence for the influence of GDP per capita, local budgetary revenues, and local fiscal revenue on the yield spreads are found, which can provide support for pricing municipal bonds in China",
