  "title": "Regulatory technology (Reg-Tech) in financial stability supervision: Taxonomy, key methods, applications and future directions",
  "abstract": "Financial regulation is the basic requirement for financial stability. Recently, regulatory technology (Reg-Tech) has become one of the main research topics in financial stability regulation. Reg-Tech aims to use artificial intelligence technologies to realize intelligent identification and early risk warning. It is a powerful tool for assisting financial regulation informatization and high efficiency. This study aims to comprehensively review the application of smart technology in financial stability regulation, and analyze the objects and results of the technology's applications. We build a framework for the application of complex networks, knowledge graphs, machine learning, and dynamic systems in Reg-Tech. The aim is to form a clear context for its development, and serve as the support and development foundation for financial stability research. Finally, we summarize the limitations and shortcomings of current Reg-Tech developments, and discuss future research and development directions.",
