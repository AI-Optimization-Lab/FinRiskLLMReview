  "title": "Asset Pricing and Entropy",
  "abstract": "We investigate entropy as a novel risk measure which explains the equity premium of securities and portfolios in a simpler way and at the same time with higher explanatory power than the beta parameter of the capital asset pricing. To measure the risk of an investment opportunity the portfolio theory applies the variance of the return, and show that the risk can be reduced by diversification and the systematic risk (beta) is applied as the risk measure. Entropy represents a measure of the uncertainty of a probability variable. Analogously, for asset pricing we define the continuous entropy as an alternative measure of risk. Our results show that the entropy is decreasing in the function of the number of securities involved into a portfolio similarly to the variance. In this empirical study we use the daily returns of 150 randomly selected securities for a period of 27 years. Our regression results show that the entropy has a higher explanatory power for the expected return than the CAPM beta.",
