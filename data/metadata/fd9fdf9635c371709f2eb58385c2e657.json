  "title": "Education commodification: university and professor funding, student loan risk assessment and webometrics",
  "abstract": "Commodification of education has a lot of aspects from theoretical extreme left or humanistic options to extreme right slavery actions. In our research we define the politically correct eligible student spending from the humanistic banker view. Then we present three proposals. For the first proposal the golden rule of our methodology is that we assume that all student then taxed workers above the sector average gained this excessive income, due to their previous University education. Then university funding follows this market oriented evaluation. Our other proposals are not that radical but they use the existed banking rules to facilitate student education loans. Credit risk distribution and assessment is used to split the credit danger amongst a lot of financial partners. A similar practical method to evaluate student loan is the webometrics science. Webometrics is used extensive for worldwide university classification and it ready for student credit use.",
