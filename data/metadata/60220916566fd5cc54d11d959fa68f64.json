  "title": "Integrating GIS and BCG model for marketing strategic planning",
  "abstract": "Among the available marketing strategic planning tools, the Boston Consulting Group's (BCG) Product-Portfolio Analysis is one of the important and popular-used tools in the last three decades. Given the known limitations of this tool (such as highly subjectivity, introducing irrational emotions into the decision-making process etc.) and the need of extending this tool into spatial dimension, this paper discusses and demonstrates the roles of Geographical Information System (GIS) in enhancing BCG analysis in spatial dimension. Taking automobile Brand X market performance analysis as the case study, this paper illustrates the significance and the benefits of using GIS tools (such as database management, classification and interactive based exploratory tools) in marketing strategic planning.",
