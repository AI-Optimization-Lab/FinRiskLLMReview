  "title": "UTAUT Theory based User Acceptance Model of the Internet Financial and Empirical Study",
  "abstract": "Exploring the key factors that influence users to accept the internet financial can help to promote the development of the internet financial business. In this paper, based on UTAUT (the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) theory, the author constructs the internet financial business acceptance model, which introduces factors of personal innovativeness and perceives risk, and designs a questionnaire. The credibility and effectiveness of the questionnaire are verified, and the correlations between factors of the model are attested. The author also establishes the regression equation between the factors to prove the rationality of the acceptance model proposed in this paper.",
