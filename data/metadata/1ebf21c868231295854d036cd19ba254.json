  "title": "Gender and dietary diversity among children aged 6-24months-evidence from a nationally representative survey",
  "abstract": "Background Malnutrition among children remains a critical public health challenge in India. WHO's IYCF model recommends that children should feed on five out of eight food categories daily. The objective of the study is to assess dietary diversity and associated risk factors among children, focusing on complex interplay of socio-economic and demographic factors. Methods The study utilized nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted in 2019-2021, focusing on a sample of 62,553 children aged 6-24 months. Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) was assessed using children received foods from >= 5 food group out of eight specified food groups over the 24 h preceding the survey. Logistic regression employed to examine the association between DD and its predictors (p value < 0.05). Results Overall, 52% of the children were male, while the remaining 48% were female. Only 23.3% of the children across India achieved MDD. Mother's education was positively associated with dietary diversity (OR:1.15; 95% CI:0.92-1.4). Factors significantly associated with dietary diversity were children aged 19-23 months (OR:4.03; CI:3.46-4.69), working mothers (OR:1.30; 95% CI:1.14-1.5) and children belonged to middle (OR:1.22; CI:1.05-1.43) and rich socio-economic status (OR:1.48; CI:1.26-1.8) as compared to their counterparts. Additionally, no difference found in dietary diversity among male and female children (OR:1.01; CI:0.9-1.11) and urban and rural areas (OR:101; CI:0.87-1.17). Those children belonged to Northeast region had around 70% higher dietary diversity as compared to Central region. Conclusion This study highlights a concerning low prevalence of dietary diversity among young children in India. Interventions and policies should target on implementing comprehensive nutrition education programs for caregivers, coupled with targeted financial support and community engagement.",
