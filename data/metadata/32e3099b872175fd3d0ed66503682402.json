  "title": "Uncompensated Care is Highest for Rural Hospitals, Particularly in Non-Expansion States",
  "abstract": "High levels of uncompensated care impact hospital profitability and may create challenges for rural hospitals at financial risk of closure. We explore 2019 hospital uncompensated care as a percentage of operating expenses and draw comparisons at a state level by Medicaid expansion status and rural classification. We further compare uncompensated care in 2019 to 2014 in rural hospitals by Medicaid expansion implementation timing. We found that, overall, rural hospitals had more uncompensated care than urban hospitals in 2019 (3.81% vs. 3.12%), but there was a larger difference by expansion status (expansion states: 2.55% vs. non-expansion states: 6.28%). In all but seven states, rural hospitals reported higher uncompensated care than urban, and the 14 states with the highest uncompensated care had not expanded Medicaid. We observed that rural hospital uncompensated care in non-expansion states increased between 2014 and 2019, while the most dramatic decrease occurred in late-expansion states.",
