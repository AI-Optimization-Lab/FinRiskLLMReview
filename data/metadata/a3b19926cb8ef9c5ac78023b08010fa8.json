  "title": "Collaborative strategies and relational capital: covering MSME risk in weak markets",
  "abstract": "MSMEs have a very high probability of bankruptcy when they operate in economies with weak markets. According to empirical data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Ecuador, after seven years of creation, 75% of these companies exit the market. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that there is a direct and strong relationship between Relational Capital, Collaborative Strategies and Value at Risk in MSMEs. From this perspective, the principles and theoretical foundations of process-based collaborative actions as a sustained value generator in weak markets are explored. An empirical methodology was applied, based on structural equation and regression models, with secondary information from 367 MSMEs of the commercial sector taken from the Superintendence of Companies of Ecuador and surveys to businessmen and specialized academics. It is concluded that Relational - Collaborative management can overcome the characteristic weakness of the markets, even though they maintain their general dynamics. Based on this synergy, the efficient management of key financial variables that contribute to minimize the value in business risk is achieved.",
