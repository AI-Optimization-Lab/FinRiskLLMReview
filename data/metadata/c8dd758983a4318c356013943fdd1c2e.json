  "title": "Predictors of E-cigarette Use Among Young Australian Women",
  "abstract": "Introduction: E-cigarette use is controversial worldwide. The majority of previous studies on e-cigarette use were not gender specific. This study aimed to identify the predictors of e-cigarette use among young Australian women. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from the 1989-1995 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. In 2015, study participants (N=8,915) aged 19-26 years completed an online survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of e-cigarette use. Data were analyzed in 2018. Results: The prevalence of ever and past-year e-cigarette use among young Australian women was 11.1% and 6.4%, respectively. More than a quarter of past-year and ever e-cigarette users were never cigarette smokers. Use of e-cigarettes in the past year was associated with younger age (AOR per year increase=0.87, 95% CI=0.82, 0.93); financial difficulty (AOR=0.68, 95% CI=0.54, 0.87); being an ex-smoker (AOR=5.05, 95% CI=3.64, 7.01) or current cigarette smoker (AOR=10.01, 95% CI=7.77, 12.89); drinking at a level of lifetime risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury (AOR=1.23, 95% CI=1.01, 1.53). Ever e-cigarette use showed similar associations and was also associated with rural residence (AOR=0.74, 95% CI=0.60, 0.91) and intimate partner violence (AOR=1.44, 95% CI=1.17, 1.76). Conclusions: The high prevalence of e-cigarette use among never cigarette smokers has significant public health implications. Interventions to curb the use of e-cigarettes among young Australian women should focus on risk factors, such as early age, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and intimate partner violence.
