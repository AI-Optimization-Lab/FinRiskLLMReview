  "title": "Research on Credit Card Fraud Detection System Based on Federated Learning",
  "abstract": "Since the reform and opening up, my country's economic growth has been strong, and it has achieved brilliant achievements in the past few decades. With the digital transformation of the economy, credit card fraud has become a more prominent problem. Due to the confidentiality of personal transaction data and the small amount of data from a single bank, it is difficult for financial institutions to jointly build fraud detection models, which greatly increases the economic risks of financial institutions. Therefore, this paper builds a credit card fraud detection system based on federated learning. Under the premise of protecting data privacy, it realizes multi-institutional collaboration through distributed machine learning technology and improves the risk management capabilities of financial institutions.",
