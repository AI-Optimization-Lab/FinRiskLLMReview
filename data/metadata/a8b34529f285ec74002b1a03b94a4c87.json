  "title": "Implementing Low Carbon Improvement Practices in Supply Network",
  "abstract": "This paper aims to discuss the low carbon practices development in manufacturing companies. As the environmental-friendly pressure and internal energy-saving motivation are growing, firms start to implement decarbonization projects across their supply chain. This study conducts case studies to these projects in 11 companies. A process framework of implementing low-carbon improvement practices is generated via the case analysis. Before building up the framework, the constituents within the framework are also discussed, including the three constructs which lead to classification of improvement projects, the process of project portfolio generation, internal supporting system and external supports. This novel study covers the absence of method to design de-carbonization action in operation management field. Also it expands the understanding to continuous improvement for environmental purpose. Practically the process framework can guide CSR or carbon managers to design corporate carbon strategy.",
