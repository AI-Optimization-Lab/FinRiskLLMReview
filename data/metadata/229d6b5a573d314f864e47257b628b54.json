  "title": "The Empirical Research on the CAMP Model for Shanghai Stock Market in the Post-crisis Era",
  "abstract": "The Shanghai A-share is presented by an empirical test using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)in the post-crisis era event window in this paper. The test was carried out by means of Eviews software and quadratic regression models, selecting the closing prices of thirty shares from 2008 to 2010 as test samples. The results show that the beta-value is not a significant factor in the stock return rate; there is a positive relation between the rate of return and system risk; and the non-system risk of individual stock contributes to the capital asset pricing as well. To eliminate the non-system risk of individual stock, the test is modified by the stock portfolio based on the beta-value. As a result, it has drawn a conclusion that non-system risk of portfolio can be dispersed.",
