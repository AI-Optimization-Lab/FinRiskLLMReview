  "title": "Genetic Algorithm Applied Research in the Individual Credit Portfolio Scoring",
  "abstract": "With the increasing scale of individual credit consumption, the individual credit risk scoring becomes more important. This paper selects 640 sample data in the personal credit in Germany as a research object. first of all, this paper preliminary screens primitive indexes, then genetic algorithm to create a portfolio scoring model based on linear regression and logistic regression using the sample classification accuracy as fitness function. The results shows that the portfolio scoring model by genetic algorithm has higher prediction accuracy than a single model and portfolio scoring model based on the smallest sum of squared errors, and it has an advantage in the individual credit risk scoring.",
