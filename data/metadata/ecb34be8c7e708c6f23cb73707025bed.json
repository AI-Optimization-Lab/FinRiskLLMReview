  "title": "IN SPECTION THE EFFECTIVE OF CAMEL MODEL ON PROFITABILITY OF IRANIAN BANKING SYSTEM",
  "abstract": "In this research which has been fulfilled with the title of Inspection the CAMEL Model on profitability of Iranian banking system , it has been tried that the effect of the aforementioned mode presented by the international banking institution regarding the health of the banks and also includes the capital, asset, management, earning, liquidity, risk to be questioned on the banking profitability: this research include 1 main and 6 sub-theories. At the research literature and after due introduction of the banking system any of these research variables have been explained. This research is of the practical research type and the results of this research will be used in financial institutions, including banks and stok exchanges, while the unprocessed data will be for calculating the CAMEL indexes from the balance sheet profitloss statement and the summary of the banking system performance factors. Then, the economy-measuring and linear regression( step wise method) and the pierson coefficient have been used for due analysis and testing the theories and the following results have been acquired.",
