  "title": "Importance of Customer Satisfaction Factors in Strategic Marketing: Neural Network Method",
  "abstract": "In strategic marketing the customer satisfaction with products of services plays the significant feedback for companies. They can effectively customize their products and services on the basis of received data from this customers' feedback. A wide portfolio of products with different functionalities is advantageous for customers because they can better choose products or services with such characteristics that maximize their utility. However, companies need to push down the costs of the internal activities and processes and minimize the use of their limited resources. It is necessary for companies to get to know such factors of goods or services which are the most significant for customer satisfaction so that they could be able to dispose effectively with their resources. For this reason the target of this study is to present the new method of determining the significance of individual factors within the measurement of overall customer satisfaction. Neural network is the core of the new method.",
