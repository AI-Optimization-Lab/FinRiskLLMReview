  "title": "Textbook Outcome for Superior Cavopulmonary Connection: A Metric for Single Ventricle Heart Surgery",
  "abstract": "Background: To develop a more holistic measure of congenital heart center performance beyond mortality, we created a composite textbook outcome (TO) for the Glenn operation. We hypothesized that meeting TO would have a positive prognostic and financial impact. Methods: This was a single center retrospective study of patients undergoing superior cavopulmonary connection (bidirectional Glenn or Kawashima +/- concomitant procedures) from 2005 to 2021. Textbook outcome was defined as freedom from operative mortality, reintervention, 30-day readmission, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, major thrombotic complication, length of stay (LOS) >75th percentile (17d), and mechanical ventilation duration >75th percentile (2d). Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used. Results: Fifty-one percent (137/269) of patients met TO. Common reasons for TO failure were prolonged LOS (78/132, 59%) and ventilator duration (67/132, 51%). In multivariable analysis, higher weight [odds ratio, OR: 1.44 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.15-1.84), P = .002] was a positive predictor of TO achievement while right ventricular dominance [OR 0.47 (0.27-0.81), P = .007] and higher preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance [OR 0.58 (0.40-0.82), P = .003] were negative predictors. After controlling for preoperative factors and excluding operative mortalities, TO achievement was independently associated with a decreased risk of death over long-term follow-up [hazard ratio: 0.50 (0.25-0.99), P = .049]. Textbook outcome achievement was also associated with lower direct cost of care [$137,626 (59,333-167,523) vs $262,299 (114,200-358,844), P < .0001]. Conclusion: Achievement of the Glenn TO is associated with long-term survival and lower costs and can be predicted by certain risk factors. As outcomes continue to improve within congenital heart surgery, operative mortality will become a less informative metric. Textbook outcome analysis may represent a more balanced measure of a successful outcome.",
