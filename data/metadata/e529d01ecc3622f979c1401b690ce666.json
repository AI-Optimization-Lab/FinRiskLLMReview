  "title": "Combining low-volatility and mean-reversion anomalies: Better together?",
  "abstract": "This paper contributes to the existing stock market anomaly literature by being the first to analyze the benefits of combining two distinct anomalies; specifically, the low-volatility and mean-reversion anomalies. Our results show that on a long-only basis, these two time-varying anomalies could be combined into a double-sort investment strategy that includes some desirable characteristics from each of them, thereby making the portfolio return accumulation more stable over time. As the added-value of low-volatility investing stems mostly from the risk-reduction side, while contrarian stocks are generally highly volatile with remarkable upside potential, the use of the double-sort portfolio-formation in which the contrarian stocks are picked from the sub-set of below-median volatility stocks can shorten the below-market performance periods that have occasionally materialized for plain low-volatility or plain contrarian investors.Abstract JEL classification: G11",
