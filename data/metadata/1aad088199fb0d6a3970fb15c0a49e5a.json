  "title": "Prevalence and Factors Associated With Healthy Aging in a Large Representative Community Sample of Older Ethiopians",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To examine the prevalence and predictors of healthy aging among community-dwelling older adults living in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study included older adults aged 60 and above (n = 845; Mage = 71 years; 56.4% females). Poisson regression estimated the Relative Risk (RR) of factors associated with healthy aging status. Results: 36.7% of respondents were classified as healthy agers. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of healthy aging included reporting not being lonely, adequate nutrition, no multimorbidity, good self-rated health, financial independence, and engaging in at least 1 hour of moderate physical activity per week. Discussion: The proportion of healthy agers in this study was substantially lower compared to developed countries but comparable to the prevalence reported in similar developing nations. Enhancing physical activity, ensuring proper nutrition, interventions to foster social participation engagement, and networking, and managing chronic diseases were identified as promising strategies to promote healthy aging.",
