  "title": "DECOMPOSITION OF THE TECHNOLOGY OF CREATION OF COMMODITY PORTFOLIO OF A TEXTILE ENTERPRISE",
  "abstract": "In economics and management, classical single-factor study of an object is being pursued increasingly rarely. The results of multifactor studies can be presented explicitly in the form of scales and matrices of various dimensions. This article provides a classification of the technologies of creation of commodity portfolio of an enterprise in the form of two- and three-dimensional taxonomic (classification) space. Squares of matrices correspond to objects and methods of creation of a variety of products manufactured by the enterprise. Substantive, procedural, and innovation levels of the hierarchy of the technology of commodity portfolio creation are considered as the classification criteria.",
