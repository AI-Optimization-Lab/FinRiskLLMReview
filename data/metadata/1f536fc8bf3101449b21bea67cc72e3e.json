  "title": "STUDYING PECULIARITIES OF UKRAINIAN BANKING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT BY MEANS OF APPLYING KOHONEN MAP",
  "abstract": "The article presents the results of the analysis of the banks' financial state by means of the neural network model of clusterization - the Kohonen map. As a result of grouping the banks with similar characteristics the author determines five directions for the development, each of them is related to specific risk profiles and certain management strategies.",
