  "title": "An Empirical Study of Stock Return and Investor Sentiment Based on Text Mining and LSTM",
  "abstract": "Based on the development of social network and big data, we adopt the unstructured text-based investors' comment data mining from the stock bar forum, and use long short-term memory neural network for text sentiment analysis to build a more accurate investor sentiment indicator. Based on this indicator, an empirical study on the component stocks of the GEM Composite Index is conducted to explore the impact of investor sentiment on stock return. Through a full sample stock selection test, we find that the performance of the portfolio based on investor sentiment indicator performs significantly better than the benchmark. Further more, compared with the basic Fama-French three factor model, the goodness of fit and significance of the asset pricing model with investor sentiment factor added are both improved, indicating that the investor sentiment index we constructed can capture the investors' sentiment in the market well, and has a good explanatory power for stock return.",
