  "title": "Ex-post facto analysis of cryptocurrency literature over a decade using bibliometric technique",
  "abstract": "Heaping praise on cryptocurrency network due to its transparency, portability, divisibility, and resistance to inflation, the crypto market has gained huge support from investors and traders worldwide. Given its rising popularity, most of the central banks today plan to launch their own cryptocurrencies. Such phenomenal growth trend has undoubtedly impacted academic research with hundreds of publications filling the academic space. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the academic trends and thematic dimensions of cryptocurrency research. Applying bibliometrics, we track ten thematic clusters identified as: cryptocurrency as a tool for risk management; decentralization of crypto transactions using blockchain and fintech; regulatory and digital framework of cryptocurrencies; market efficiency of cryptocurrencies; pricing efficiency of cryptocurrencies; price clustering and liquidity in crypto transactions; cryptocurrency as an investment asset; portfolio diversification using cryptocurrency; trading volume, return and volatility of cryptocurrencies; and role of information in the volatility of crypt prices. Along with an analysis of each of the thematic clusters, we provide directions for future research.",
