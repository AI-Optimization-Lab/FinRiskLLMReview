  "title": "RETRACTED: Analysis and Prediction of Corporate Finance and Exchange Rate Correlation Based on Machine Learning Algorithms (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "Based on the risk management of exposure to foreign exchange assets and liabilities and the application of financial derivatives, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the financial and exchange rate risks of foreign-funded enterprises. Therefore, a method of evaluating the financial performance of listed financial enterprises based on principal component analysis and neural network model is proposed. First, principal components of alternative financial performance input-output indicators are extracted using principal component analysis. Subsequently, these principal components are used as input-output data for the DEA model to derive the relative validity evaluation results of the financial performance of individual financial enterprises and to provide a reference for decision making to improve the financial performance level of financial enterprises. Combined with the economic business data of the enterprises, an empirical test on exchange rate risk management is conducted and relevant suggestions are made on how foreign enterprises can reduce exchange rate risk losses. It has important theoretical value and practical significance for enterprise finance and exchange rate management.",
