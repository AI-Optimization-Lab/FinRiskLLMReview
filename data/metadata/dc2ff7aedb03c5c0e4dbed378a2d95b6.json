  "title": "Pricing of Mixed Compound Real Options",
  "abstract": "The composition and mutual relations among real options in the project life cycle are extremely complex, and the existing models of real options can't well describe the interrelated management flexibility. Therefore, this paper puts forward the new classification for compound real options, gives the concept of mixed compound real options, and studies the interactions among the constituents and their pricing. The research holds that the basic relations among real options are the string, OR, and AND, which are key to the pricing of different types of mixed compound real options, and the biggest pricing difference between mixed compound real options and a single real option is in their underlying assets. Finally, the pricing method is illustrated by a case.",
