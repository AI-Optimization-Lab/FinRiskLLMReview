  "title": "Association of Burden and Prevalence of Arthritis With Disparities in Social Risk Factors, Findings From 17 US States",
  "abstract": "Introduction Social risks previously have been associated with arthritis prevalence and costs. Although social risks often cluster among individuals, no studies have examined associations between multiple social risks within the same individual. Our objective was to determine the association between individual and multiple social risks and the prevalence and burden of arthritis by using a representative sample of adults in 17 US states. Methods Data are from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Respondents were 136,432 adults. Social risk factors were food insecurity, housing insecurity, financial insecurity, unsafe neighborhoods, and health care access hardship. Weighted.2 and logistic regression analyses, controlling for demographic characteristics, measures of socioeconomic position, and other health conditions examined differences in arthritis prevalence and burden by social risk factor and by a social risk index created by summing the social risk factors. Results We observed a gradient in the prevalence and burden of arthritis. Compared with those reporting 0 social risk factors, respondents reporting 4 or more social risk factors were more likely to have arthritis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-2.36) and report limited usual activities (AOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.20-4.02), limited work (AOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 2.06-3.60), limited social activities (AOR, 3.10; 95% CI, 2.26-4.26), and severe joint pain (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.44-2.41). Conclusion Incremental increases in the number of social risk factors were independently associated with higher odds of arthritis and its burden. Intervention efforts should address the social context of US adults to improve health outcomes.",
