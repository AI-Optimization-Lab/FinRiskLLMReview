  "title": "Daily cannabis use during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada: a repeated cross-sectional study from May 2020 to December 2020",
  "abstract": "Background Daily cannabis use is most strongly implicated in the cannabis-attributable burden of disease. In the context of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada, we characterized trends in daily cannabis use in the overall sample and various population subgroups, and examined risk characteristics associated with daily cannabis use. Methods A cross-sectional design was operationalized using data from six waves of a national, online survey of adults residing in Canada who spoke English (N = 6,021; May-08 2020 to December-01 2020). Trends were characterized using the Cochran-Armitage test and risk characteristics were identified using chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Results Daily cannabis use in the overall sample remained stable (5.34% - 6.10%; p = 0.30). This pattern of findings extended to various population subgroups as well. The odds of daily cannabis use were higher for those who: were males (Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.46; 1.15 - 1.85), were between 18 - 29 years (2.36; 1.56 - 3.57), 30 - 39 years (2.65; 1.93 - 3.64) or 40-49 years (1.74; 1.19 - 2.54), self-identified as white (1.97; 1.47 - 2.64), had less than college or university completion (1.78; 1.39 - 2.28), engaged in heavy episodic drinking (2.05; 1.62 - 2.61), had a job that increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 (1.38; 1.01 - 1.88), experienced loneliness 5-7 days in the past week (1.86; 1.26 - 2.73) and felt very worried (2.08; 1.21 - 3.58) or somewhat worried (1.83; 1.11 - 3.01) about the pandemic's impact on their financial situation. Conclusions Daily cannabis use did not change in the overall sample or various population subgroups during the pandemic. Pandemic-related risks and impacts were associated with daily cannabis use.",
