  "abstract": "Time series of financial asset values exhibit well-known statistical features such as heavy tails and volatility clustering. We propose a nonparametric extension of the classical Peaks-Over-Threshold method from extreme value theory to fit the time varying volatility in situations where the stationarity assumption may be violated by erratic changes of regime, say. As a result, we provide a method for estimating conditional risk measures applicable to both stationary and nonstationary series. A backtesting study for the UBS share price over the subprime crisis exemplifies our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
