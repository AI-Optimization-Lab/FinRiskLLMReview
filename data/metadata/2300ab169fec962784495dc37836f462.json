  "abstract": "Two Burr regression models are proposed. These models extend existing log-logistic regression models. An algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimators is proposed. Graphical techniques for model validation are incorporated. An actuarial application to portfolio segmentation for fire insurance is included. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
