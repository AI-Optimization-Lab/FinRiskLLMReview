  "title": "Real options pricing based on BP neural networks and-GA",
  "abstract": "This paper applies artificial neural networks on real options pricing. We discard redundant nodes and branches of neural networks through choosing variables by using genetic algorithms, so that the optimization on BP neural networks can be realized. In the process of pricing, we consider some factors that have influence on real options pricing and are neglected by existing pricing method, so the precision of evaluation can be improved to a certain extent, which is indicated by simulation results.",
