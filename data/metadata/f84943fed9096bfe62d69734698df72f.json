  "title": "RETRACTION: How does financialization affect functional income distribution? A theoretical clarification and empirical assessment (Retraction of Vol 15, Pg 853, 2017)",
  "abstract": "It is frequently asserted that financialization has contributed to the decline in the wage share. This article provides a theoretical clarification and a systematic empirical investigation. We identify four arguments for why financialization would affect the wage share: (a) a Political Economy approach focusing on the exit options of firms; (b) a mark-up pricing approach stressing the role of financial overhead costs for firms; (c) increased competition on capital markets and shareholder value orientation; and (d) the role of household debt in increasing workers' financial vulnerability and undermining their class consciousness. The article compiles a comprehensive set of empirical measures of financialization and uses it to test these hypotheses with a panel regression of 14 OECD countries over the 1989-2011 period. We find strong evidence for negative effects of household debt and evidence for negative effects of financial deregulation on the wage share.",
