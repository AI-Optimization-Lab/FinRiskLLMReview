  "title": "Predictors of Cataract Surgery Among US Adults: NHANES 2007-2008",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Cataract, characterized by the clouding of the lens, is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide. While cataract surgery is an effective treatment, it carries substantial costs, potential complications, and limited accessibility for those facing financial barriers. Hence, this study aimed to identify the sociodemographic, behavioral, medical, and occupational risk factors of cataract development among adults aged 40 and above. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 2866 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle from 2007 to 2008. We utilized a purposeful selection approach to identify the most suitable predictors for cataract surgery. We further used a multivariate logistic regression procedure that accounted for complex sampling design, to assess the main effect of each predictor, entered jointly into the model. Results: Age, blood pressure, and diabetes were identified as predictors of cataract surgery. Each additional year of age increased the odds of undergoing cataract surgery by 15% (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.13-1.16). Participants with high blood pressure had a 38% higher likelihood of cataract surgery (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.11-1.73), while those with diabetes faced a 63% higher likelihood (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.27-2.09). Conclusions: Managing diabetes and blood pressure, especially among older adults, may be crucial in delaying cataract progression.",
