  "title": "E-PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING LDA",
  "abstract": "E-Portfolio has recently become important in education. E-Portfolio systems gather amount of data such as learners output, performance, grade, learning diary and history. This huge amount of data has high potential to become a useful educational tool. However, it is difficult to find beneficial e-Portfolio for learners from the massiveness of learners' data. For this reason, this paper proposes an e-Portfolio recommendation system that recommends learning output such as homework of learners who have similar interests in their e-Portfolios. This research consists of a topic model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a document classification method to analyze learning output in e-Portfolios. LDA can estimate topics, similar to categories or themes mainly included in documents. The proposed system computes similarity between learning output in e-Portfolios using topics, and recommends similar others' e-Portfolio. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system using actual classroom data in engineering course.",
