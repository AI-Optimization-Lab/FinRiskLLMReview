  "title": "Optimizing portfolio selection through stock ranking and matching: A reinforcement learning approach",
  "abstract": "Predicting asset movements with machine learning (ML) algorithms remains a complex challenge, particularly in selecting optimal models or designing effective ensemble strategies. This study presents a novel methodology that synergizes reinforcement learning (RL) with advanced ML algorithms-LSTM, XGBoost, and Deep RankNet-to improve prediction accuracy and portfolio construction. The approach incorporates hyperparameter optimization, innovative feature engineering, and a comprehensive comparison of algorithmic performance. RL serves a dual role as both an ensemble strategy and a dynamic learning layer, enabling a 15% increase in cumulative returns compared to traditional ensemble techniques. This advancement highlights RL's capacity to refine predictions and enhance risk assessment by adaptively integrating outputs from diverse algorithms. Beyond demonstrating superior performance, the study provides actionable insights for practitioners seeking to construct effective, risk-sensitive trading portfolios.",
