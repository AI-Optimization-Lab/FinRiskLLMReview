  "title": "Relationship between financial indicators and start-ups' bankruptcy risk: The technology sector in Portugal",
  "abstract": "Financial management in the context of a start-up has gained prominence in the literature due to entrepreneurs' insufficient and often incapable analysis. This study examines differences in financial indicators during the initial years of operation between technology start-ups in Portugal that went bankrupt and those that remained active, focusing on the period between 2013-2022. Using a panel data sample of 4,591 companies, hypothesis tests and the Probit regression model were applied. The results reveal statistically significant differences in financial indicators between bankrupt and nonbankrupt start-ups. General liquidity and operating return on assets positively correlate with the likelihood of survival, while immediate liquidity and return on equity have an inverse relationship with nonbankruptcy probability. Consequently, the study identifies a set of average values to monitor, guiding entrepreneurs to avoid bankruptcy. The research provides practical guidelines for financial management in start-ups and aids in analyzing financial indicators to reduce bankruptcy risk.",
