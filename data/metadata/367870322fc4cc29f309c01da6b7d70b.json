  "title": "A New Competing Risks Model for Predicting Prepayment and Default Using Data Mining",
  "abstract": "With the reform of economic environment, microfinance has become increasingly active. However, the rapid growth of it has many potential risks caused by imperfect development, which leads to management crisis faced by financial institutions and even in danger of collapse. Therefore, financial institutions should identify the borrowers' credit risk efficiently and adopt risk control strategy to reduce the losses and maximize the benefits. This study constructed a competing risks model to predict default and prepayment at the same time by using Logistic Regression. The results can be the management basis of loan business executed by financial institutions.",
