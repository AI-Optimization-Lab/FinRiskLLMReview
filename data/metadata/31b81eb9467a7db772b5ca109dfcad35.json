  "abstract": "Introduction: Among surgical patients, utilization of institutional-based postacute care (PCA) presents a notable financial burden and is associated with increased risk of complications and mortality rates when compared with discharge home. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of postdischarge disposition to PCA in geriatric patients after surgical fixation of native hip fractures. Methods: We have done a query of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program to identify geriatric (>= 65 years) patients who sustained surgical femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric hip fractures in 2016. Multivariate regression was used to compute risk factors for discharge to and prolonged stay (>30 days) in PCA. Results: Eight thousand one hundred thirty-three geriatric hip fracture patients with sufficient follow-up data were identified. Of these, 6,670 patients (82.0%) were initially discharged to PCA after their hip fracture episode of care, and 2,986 patients (36.7%) remained in PCA for >30 days. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [1.05 to 1.08],P< 0.001), partial (OR 2.41 [1.57 to 3.71],P< 0.001) or total dependence (OR 3.03 [1.92 to 4.46],P< 0.001) for activities of daily living, dementia (OR 1.62 [1.33 to 1.96],P< 0.001), diabetes (OR 1.46 [1.14 to 1.85],P= 0.002), hypertension (OR 1.32 [1.10 to 1.58],P= 0.002), and total hospital length of stay (OR 1.04 [1.01 to 1.08],P= 0.006) were independent risk factors for discharge to PCA. Age (OR 1.05 [1.04 to 1.06],P< 0.001), partial (OR 2.86 [1.93 to 3.79],P< 0.001) or total dependence (OR 3.12 [1.45 to 4.79],P< 0.001) for activities of daily living, American Society of Anesthesiologist's classification (OR 1.27 [1.13 to 1.43],P< 0.001), dementia (OR 1.49 [1.28 to 1.74],P< 0.001), and total hospital length of stay (OR 1.10 [1.08 to 1.13],P< 0.001) were independent risk factors for prolonged PCA stay >30 days. Discussion: Discharge to PCA is the norm among patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Provider foreknowledge of risk factors may help improve hip fracture outcomes and decrease healthcare costs.",
