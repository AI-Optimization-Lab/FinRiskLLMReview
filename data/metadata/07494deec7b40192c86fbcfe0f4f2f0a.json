  "title": "WHICH TYPES OF STOCKS HERDED BY FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE INFORMATIONAL IN THE EMERGING STOCK MARKET?",
  "abstract": "This study analyses which types of the stocks herded by foreign institutional investors (FII) in buying side are informational in the stock markets of the emerging countries such as Taiwan. By employing a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model, we find that the FII buying herding patterns are informational for lower firms' unexpected earning and lower return stocks and undervalued value stocks. Next, the price effects of the FII buying herding on stock types are different in bull and bear periods. To improve portfolio performance, general investors can follow FII to purchase the stock types of FII buying herding in the emerging markets. The price persistence of institutional herding can be further integrated with the stock types of past firms' unexpected earnings, returns, and book-to-market ratio.",
