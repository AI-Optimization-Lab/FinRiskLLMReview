  "title": "Cybersecurity policy, ESG and operational risk: A Virtuous relationship to improve banks' performance",
  "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between cybersecurity policies (CSP), Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, operational risk, and bank profitability. While operational risk and ESG have been extensively studied, limited research addresses their intersection with CSP in banking. Using a dataset of 1673 bank-year observations across multiple economic regions (2009-2023), we employ an interrupted time series (ITS) regression approach to assess the impact of CSP adoption on bank performance. Our findings reveal that banks implementing CSP experience improved financial resilience, with CSP having a statistically significant positive effect on return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return in tangible equity (ROTE). ESG scores positively correlate with bank profitability, while operational risk plays a nuanced role. This study extends institutional theory by demonstrating how CSP implementation enhances banking stability, regulatory compliance, and financial sustainability. By aligning ESG frameworks with CSP, banks can achieve a sustainable, secure, and profitable operating model that enhances financial resilience and stakeholder trust.",
