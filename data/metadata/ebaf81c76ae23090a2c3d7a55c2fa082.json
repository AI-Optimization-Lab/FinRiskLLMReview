  "title": "Cost-related Nonadherence to Medication Treatment Plans Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander National Health Interview Survey, 2014",
  "abstract": "Background: Adherence to medication treatment plans is important for chronic disease (CD) management. Cost-related nonadherence (CRN) puts patients at risk for complications. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) suffer from high rates of CD and socioeconomic disparities that could increase CRN behaviors. Objective: Examine factors related to CRN to medication treatment plans within an understudied population. Research Design: Using 2014 NHPI-National Health Interview Survey data, we examined CRN among a nationally representative sample of NHPI adults. Bonferroni-adjusted Wald test and multivariable logistic regression were performed to examine associations among financial burden-related factors, CD status, and CRN. Results: Across CD status, NHPI engaged in CRN behaviors had, on an average, increased levels of perceived financial stress, financial insecurity with health care, and food insecurity compared with adults in the total NHPI population. Regression analysis indicated perceived financial stress [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)= 1.16; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.10-1.22], financial insecurity with health care (AOR= 1.96; 95% CI, 1.32-2.90), and food insecurity (AOR= 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61) all increase the odds of CRN among those with CD. We also found significant associations between perceived financial stress (AOR= 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20), financial insecurity with health care (AOR= 1.59; 95% CI, 1.19-2.12), and food insecurity (AOR= 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.65) and request for lower cost medication. Conclusions: This study demonstrated health-related and nonhealth- related financial burdens can influence CRN behaviors. It is important for health care providers to collect and use data about the social determinants of health to better inform their conversations about medication adherence and prevent CRN.",
