  "abstract": "Governments, experts and scholars have appealed to business enterprises to attach great importance to the use of patent system. However, all of these appeals are recognition of the patent system. It is of no help because they can't understand the essential of patent system, though they have known that patent rights are the roots of modern enterprises. Compared with recognition, practice - the execution of patent strategy for enterprises, is more important. This is an unresolved problem. The paper will start with the problems emerging during execution of the patent in enterprises and bring forward pertinently the Pearson's Accumulated Margin Law for enterprises to establish the patent strategy. Following this, it will select and draw up the patent strategy that matches the enterprises development and establish a strong patent portfolio according to the correlation between the patent rights and enterprise development. Furthermore, the principle of classification-technology level-cost colligation is raised for enterprises' patent application in this paper, and can be utilized to apply for patents by enterprises through selecting the right patent types on these principles.",
