  "title": "METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATES - AN INTERNATIONAL TREND",
  "abstract": "Measuring and determining interest rate provides keys to using derivatives to control interest rate risk, and controlling interest rate risk in a mortgage-backed securities derivative portfolio. This paper objective includes necessity of measuring yield curve risk, swaps and exchangetraded options and related products, and describes how to measure and control the interest rate of risk of a bond portfolio or trading position. Measuring and determining interest rate is a systematic evaluation of how to measure and control the interest rate risk of a bond portfolio or trading position. The authors construct a verbal flow chart, defining and illustrating interest rate in regards to valuation, probability distributions, forecasting yield volatility, correlation and regression analyses. Hedging instruments discussed include futures contracts, interest rate swaps, exchange traded options, and credit derivatives. Outcomes of this paper will be that how to find up-to-date information on measuring interest rate with derivatives, quantifying the results of positions, and hedging.",
