  "title": "Exploring the synergy of digital competence and photo-driven reflection: A pilot study on reflective thinking skill development in business education",
  "abstract": "While the significance of imparting reflective thinking skills to business undergraduates is widely acknowledged, the optimal approaches to attain this objective remain uncertain. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of specific teaching initiatives aimed at achieving this goal. Therefore, firstly, this pilot study introduces a digital approach to developing reflective thinking skills. It builds upon the integration of using photographs to capture learning experiences, combined with written narratives within the context of constructing an e-portfolio. Secondly, responding to the need to validate technology's role in developing reflective thinking skills, this pilot study utilised hierarchical linear regression to analyse survey responses from 41 business undergraduates. The aim was to test hypotheses related to the proposed initiative. The pilot study findings uncover that higher digital competencies in portfolio creation strengthen the link between the effectiveness of photo use for capturing learning experiences and undergraduates' reflective thinking skill development.",
