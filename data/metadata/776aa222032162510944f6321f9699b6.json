  "title": "The K best-paths approach to approximate dynamic programming with application to portfolio optimization",
  "abstract": "We describe a general method to transform a non-markovian sequential decision problem into a supervised learning problem using a K-best-paths algorithm. We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we can train a controller to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function. We illustrate the approach by demonstrating experimental results using a kernel-based controller architecture that would not normally be considered in traditional reinforcement learning or approximate dynamic programming.",
