  "title": "The Association Between Financial Resources Strain and Self-Reported Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Adherence among HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex with Men",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between financial resources strain and self-reported ART adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) who are living with HIV. Secondary data analyses were conducted with a sample of HIV-positive MSM (N = 77) who participated in a daily diary study on substance use and sexual behavior. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of self-reported ART adherence associated with financial resources strain. The adjusted model revealed a significant association between financial resources strain and self-reported ART adherence such that financially strained participants were 78.4% less likely to have excellent self-reported adherence ability compared with non-financially strained participants (aOR = .216, 95% CI [.063, .749], p = .016). Financial resources strain may negatively influence ART adherence. Future research should consider objectively measuring ART adherence. Health care providers might consider assessing patients' financial situation to identify those at-risk for nonadherence.",
