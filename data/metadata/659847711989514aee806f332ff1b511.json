  "title": "Correlates of sense of control among older Korean-American immigrants: Financial status, physical health constraints, and environmental challenges",
  "abstract": "Responding to the need for more research on minority older populations, the present study assessed sense of control among older Korean-American immigrants. The association of sense of control with financial status, physical health constraints, and environmental challenges was examined with a sample of 230 older Korean-Americans (M-age = 69.8, range = 60-92) in Florida. In a hierarchical regression analysis, financial limitations (poorer perceived financial status and receipt of financial support from adult children), physical health constraints (greater functional disability), and environmental challenges (lower acculturation and greater difficulty with transportation) were identified as significant risk factors for a diminished sense of control. Findings are discussed in a cultural context, and ways to promote sense of control among immigrant older populations are suggested.",
