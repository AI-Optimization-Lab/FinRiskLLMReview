  "title": "Inductive Representation Learning on Dynamic Stock Co-Movement Graphs for Stock Predictions",
  "abstract": "Co-movement among individual firms' stock prices can reflect complex inter-firm relationships. This paper proposes a novel method to leverage such relationships for stock price predictions by adopting inductive graph representation learning on dynamic stock graphs constructed based on historical stock price co-movement. To learn node representations from such dynamic graphs for better stock predictions, we propose the hybrid-attention dynamic graph neural network, an inductive graph representation learning method. We also extended mini-batch gradient descent to inductive representation learning on dynamic stock graphs so that the model can update parameters over mini-batch stock graphs with higher training efficiency. Extensive experiments on stocks from different markets and trading simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves stock predictions. The proposed method can have important implications for the management of financial portfolios and investment risk.",
