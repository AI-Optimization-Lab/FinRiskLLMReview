  "title": "How Can We Remove Psychological Entrepreneurship Barriers on Entrepreneurship Intention for Health Organizations in the Future?",
  "abstract": "Entrepreneurial orientation significantly influences business financial performance, particularly in global markets, making it pivotal across economies. Developed nations provide a conducive environment for entrepreneurship, supported by educational systems and skill development programs. Conversely, in developing countries, cultural and social disparities create unique challenges, shaping entrepreneurial intentions. Psychological barriers such as risk aversion, fear of failure, and resistance to change hinder potential entrepreneurs, particularly in health science faculties. A study conducted in Turkey aimed to explore these barriers among health science students. Data collected from 788 students revealed that psychological factors explained 72% of entrepreneurial intentions. Regression analysis confirmed the significance of risk avoidance, fear of failure, attitude towards change, and stress avoidance in shaping intentions. Despite these barriers, heightened entrepreneurial intentions among health students were associated with greater success in overcoming obstacles. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing psychological barriers in fostering innovative and entrepreneurial healthcare professionals. By understanding these dynamics, educational institutions, policymakers, and healthcare practitioners can better support the development of an entrepreneurial healthcare workforce. The intersection of healthcare and entrepreneurship presents opportunities for transformative solutions, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and advancing the healthcare sector. Despite challenges, emerging trends suggest a growing interest in leveraging innovation for positive change in healthcare, highlighting the potential for impactful contributions to the industry's evolution.",
