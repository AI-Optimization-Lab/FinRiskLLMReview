  "title": "Impact of Investing Characteristics on Financial Performance of Individual Investors: An Exploratory Study",
  "abstract": "This exploratory study examines which investing characteristics determine success in an equity market. Based on data from 403 respondents, exploratory factor analysis results in 13 factors: middle/long time horizon, qualitative analyst, open-minded/disciplined, organized, emotional stability, naive, growth stock, concentrated portfolio, contrarian, value stock, globalized, intrinsic value, and price-independent. Multiple linear regression of individual investors' excess return on these factors show statistically significant relationship. These results deepen our knowledge on what sort of investing characteristics are required to survive in equity markets.",
