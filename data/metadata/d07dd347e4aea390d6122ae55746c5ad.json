  "title": "RECENT BANK BAILOUTS - LESSONS TO LEARN WHEN PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Most recent bank bailouts from financial and economic perspective turn to be politicized. This paper frames ten effective implications/lessons of the most recent bank bailouts of 2007-2009 in the Western economy model when analyzing actual shareholders' value retrenchment or growth opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: Use of literature review and re-conceptualised framework of event study methodology. Secondary data analysis of qualitative and quantitative information. Findings: Recent bank bailouts relate to: global bailout interconnections, economic downturn and liquidity boost, abnormal returns, efficiency recovery, evade social costs, new opportunities for M&A, new risk management applications, opportunistic investors and eventually patience. Some findings recommend shareholders to grasp opportunities for bargains from bailout banks as well as still harvest their existing investments. At the same time economic education and control becomes another important solution. Research limitations/implications: Consequently, as the paper targets most recent bailouts, a still ongoing event, there is a need for extended financial data that could enhance some cause-related solutions after economic recovery. Practical implications: The practicality of the paper refers to guiding management of both government and financial institutions on the choice for reasoning bank bailouts, providing some critical thinking views to investors as well as academics. Originality/value: There has not yet been written research or studies on the most recent financial crises bailouts, due to the process continuation. The novelty of the paper's resides not in calculating ratios and interpreting them, but rather to looking more into some interesting strategic moves used to boost shareholders' value.
