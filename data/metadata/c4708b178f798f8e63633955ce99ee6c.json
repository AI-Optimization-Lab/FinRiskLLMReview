  "title": "Comparative Analytical Study for News Text Classification Techniques Applied for Stock Market Price Extrapolation",
  "abstract": "The current technological growth is tremendous so people are too much attached with technology. The most popular investing money portfolio is stock market and it's too dynamic in nature so the risk is also high to loss the money. Now days lots of research ongoing to predict the price. This study considers news impact as semantic analysis and as a technical view stock prices and index is measured. The text mining is one of the latest technologies to perform textual based analysis. There are many techniques available to perform auto news classification which is one most important phase in this research work. This paper focus on comparative study about different available techniques for semantic analysis by measuring different parameters like the accuracy, the data set used. This paper concludes with best news classification approach for stock price prediction.",
