  "title": "Factors Associated With Dental Caries in Primary Teeth of 5-and 6-Year-Old Polish Children",
  "abstract": "Background: Caries in primary teeth remain a common health issue. Aim: To identify oral health behaviours which significantly affect dental caries in children aged 5-6 years. Design: A national cross-sectional study of 1892 children integrated dental examinations and a questionnaire regarding socio-economic factors and oral health habits. Caries indices were calculated. The analyses included t- and chi-square tests, Spearman's correlation, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression (p < 0.05). Results: The majority of children (79.3%) had caries; mean dmft was 4.68 +/- 4.05; dmfs-9.12 +/- 10.74 and ft/ft. + dt-0.20 +/- 0.31. There were correlations between mother's education, her knowledge of oral health, financial burden, the frequency of dental appointments and the treatment (p < 0.001). The dmft indices were correlated with postponing dental appointments and presenting with pain. The association between the treatment index, oral hygiene habits (parental-supervised toothbrushing twice a day, using fluoridated toothpaste) and dietary practices (restrictions of sugar intake, fruit juices and starchy foodstuffs) was found, even after socio-economic confounding factors were introduced. Conclusion: The first years of a child's life are a period when the foundations of adult lifestyle choices are shaped. Parents should be aware of the importance of dental visits, nutritional counselling and proper oral care. The assessment of risk factors related to families is indispensable when prophylactic programmes are implemented.",
