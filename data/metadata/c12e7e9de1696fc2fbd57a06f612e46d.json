  "title": "Risk Identification and Evaluation in Trade Finance Innovation of Commercial Banks",
  "abstract": "Importance has been attached to trade finance innovation for it is essential for the competitiveness of commercial banks. Its risks mainly come from three aspects: market innovation, institutional innovation and portfolio innovation. These are the source of innovation risks. Based on the classification of innovation risks, identification framework and evaluation indicator system are introduced to manage the risks so as to ensure the success of trade finance innovation.",
