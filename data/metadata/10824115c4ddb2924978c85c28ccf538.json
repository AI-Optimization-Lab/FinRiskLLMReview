  "title": "THE ROLE OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MANAGING SPECULATIVE FINANCING RISKS IN ISLAMIC BANKS",
  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed unprecedented growth, driven by technological advancements, data proliferation, and the increased precision of machine learning models. The role of AI has expanded beyond merely understanding our environment to actively shaping it, with generative AI, in particular, emerging as a critical tool. Generative AI produces new, innovative content across various fields, including finance, where its applications are transformative. In Islamic banking, early theorists emphasized mudaraba, a profit-sharing mechanism, as a means to effectively mobilize resources for economic and social development. Mudaraba financing promotes fair income distribution and provides a viable way to gather investment capital and allocate financial resources. However, despite its theoretical advantages, mudaraba financing is relatively limited in modern Islamic banks. The primary reason is the associated risk management challenges, which impact the banks, clients, and broader environmental factors, creating an urgent need for effective, practical solutions. This research investigates AI in general and generative AI in particular, focusing on their potential role in managing the risks inherent in mudaraba financing within Islamic banks. It aims to understand how generative AI applications can help mitigate these risks, allowing Islamic banks to protect their funds and broaden their focus beyond traditional debt-based financing. Adopting a descriptive-analytical methodology, the study first describes generative AI's mechanisms, then examines the specific risks of mudaraba financing, and finally analyzes AI's role in managing these risks. By integrating technological advancements, this research seeks to open new avenues for sustainable growth in Islamic finance, enabling Islamic banks to safeguard their investments while supporting broader economic development.",
