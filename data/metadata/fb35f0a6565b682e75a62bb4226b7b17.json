  "abstract": "Data Mining techniques are used to extract hidden knowledge (ex: rules, patterns, regularities) from data in databases. The knowledge discovered can be applied for supporting decision-making, as for instance in the financial domain. The tool demonstrated illustrates first how data mining can support the dynamic clustering and the forecasting of stock trends, and then how XML can support the portfolio management through the definition of trading strategies.",
