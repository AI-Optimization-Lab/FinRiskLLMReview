  "title": "Behavior of Banks' Stock Market Prices during Long-Term Crises",
  "abstract": "Countries are drastically impacted by financial and fiscal crises. Financial crises have the worst impact on not only society, but also the economy. The Canadian economy underwent financial crises and recessions several times during the last century. In this paper, daily closing stock prices of five large Canadian banks were studied during the last five crisis periods. It is aimed to determine the most effective or dominant index prices on the daily closing stock price of the banks during the crisis periods. The five periods were selected from secondary data from January 1975 to December 2020 by using the graphs and the crises in the literature. Multiple linear regression was performed to analyze the impact of price indexes during crisis periods. Findings show that price index-financials had a positive impact on the daily closing price of banks during the last five economic crises in Canada. Since the banks have different investment tools in their portfolio, the impacts of price indexes on the daily closing prices depend on these portfolios, which ultimately could have led to the economic crises.",
