  "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe epidemiology of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be different worldwide. Despite similarities in medicine quality and formation, there are also significant differences concerning healthcare and ICU organisation, staffing, financial resources and population compliance and adherence. Large cohort data of critically ill patients from Central and Eastern Europe are also lacking.OBJECTIVESThe study objectives were to describe the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to Romanian ICUs with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify the factors associated with ICU mortality.DESIGNProspective, cohort, observational study.SETTINGNational recruitment, multicentre study, between March 2020 to March 2021.PATIENTSAll patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Romanian ICUs were eligible. There were no exclusion criteria.INTERVENTIONNone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREICU mortality.RESULTSThe statistical analysis included 9058 patients with definitive ICU outcome. The multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model found that age [odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23 to 1.31], male gender (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.4), medical history of neoplasia (OR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.22), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.88), type II diabetes (OR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.43), chronic heart failure (OR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49), dyspnoea (OR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5), SpO2 less than 90% (OR 3; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.5), admission SOFA score (OR 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.09), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on ICU admission (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.63) and the need for noninvasive (OR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.22) or invasive ventilation (OR 28; 95% CI, 22 to 35) and neuromuscular blockade (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 4.8), were associated with larger ICU mortality.Higher GCS on admission (OR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.83), treatment with hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95) and tocilizumab (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.71) were inversely associated with ICU mortality.CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 critically ill Romanian patients share common personal and clinical characteristics with published European cohorts. Public health measures and vaccination campaign should focus on patients at risk.",
