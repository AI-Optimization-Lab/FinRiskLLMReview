  "title": "The impact of socioeconomic determinants on respiratory mortality in Slovakia",
  "abstract": "Mortality from respiratory diseases is the third main cause of deaths in EU countries, and the number of respiratory deaths is expected to increase in the coming years. It does not focus on these issues, despite their considerable importance. The aim of this article is to explore the association between selected measures of socioeconomic status and mortality from respiratory diseases between 2005 and 2013 in the Slovak Republic. Using the panel regression model, we analysed data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and data from the National Health Information Center of the Slovak Republic. The results confirm the existence of the association between income inequalities and mortality from respiratory diseases. Income quintile ratio as a measure of income distribution inequality brings a reduction of the standardised mortality rate by 19.21 deaths each time it increases its value by one unit. Income expressed by mean equivalised net income per household performs as the least influencing indicator on the standardised mortality rate. Finally, detection of relevant respiratory risk factors is very important for planning financial and other treatment resources and managing health promotion policies.",
