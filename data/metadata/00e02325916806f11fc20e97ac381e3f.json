  "title": "Associations Between Moderately Severe to Severe Depression and Marijuana Usage Among Black Male Collegians: Results from the Healthy Minds Study",
  "abstract": "Marijuana use and depression are critical issues affecting the well-being of Black male collegians. This study examines the relationship between recent marijuana use and moderately severe to severe depression within this population, emphasizing the role of social determinants of mental health, such as financial stress and racial discrimination. Using data from the Healthy Minds Study (HMS), a cross-sectional web-based survey, 1,599 Black male collegians were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that recent marijuana use increased the likelihood of experiencing moderately severe to severe depression by 77%. Younger students and those experiencing financial stress or racial discrimination were also at higher risk. These findings highlight the importance of targeted mental health interventions that address substance use and social determinants of mental health. The study underscores the need for culturally tailored approaches to mitigate the adverse mental health effects faced by Black male collegians in higher education settings.",
