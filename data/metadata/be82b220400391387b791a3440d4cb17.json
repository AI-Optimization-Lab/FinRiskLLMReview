  "title": "Providing Learning Success as a Service: A Structured Literature Review",
  "abstract": "Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the educational sector has been forced to rapidly adapt digital forms of teaching, thus changed the status quo of teaching. Not only for coping with that situation but also with the adaption of digital technologies in general, educational service providers (ESP) become paramount. ESPs need to offer contemporary and innovative services which should serve the aim of gaining and even improving the learning outcomes. Furthermore, ESPs can take the heat off teachers who suffer under an increased workload. To address this issue, we conducted a literature review focusing on papers which covered educational service concepts that effect learning outcomes. The results are clustered by the groups of digital learning formats which in turn are transferred from the 2020 classification framework of digital learning formats by the mmb institute. Besides giving an overview of the current state of research, we demonstrate the research gap and recommendations for further research when referring to the role and service portfolio of ESPs.",
