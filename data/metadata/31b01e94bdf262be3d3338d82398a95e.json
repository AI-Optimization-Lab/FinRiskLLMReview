  "title": "Risk assessment method for guaranteeing safety in the train control system",
  "abstract": "Recently, failure of equipment has been linked directly to human casualties or financial losses from the increasing use of train control equipment utilizing computers. These systems have to progress to guarantee safety during the system life-cycle. In this paper, we examine the methods for risk analysis and assessment of safety activities and propose an optimized method for risk estimation. In the comparison of the risk graph and the risk matrix method for safety estimation, the proposed BP (Best Practice)-risk method combines the most beneficial properties of commonly used approaches.",
