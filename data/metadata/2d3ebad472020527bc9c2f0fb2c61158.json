  "title": "Systemic Risk Measurement of Listed Securities Firms in China",
  "abstract": "With the deepening of financial development of China, the risk of the financial industry accumulated ceaselessly. So the management risk of financial industry, especially the management risk of the securities industry is essential. Therefore, this paper studies the measuring method of systemic risk of the securities industry. First, this paper introduces the related theories and methods about how to estimate CoVaR by using quantile regression method; Secondly, we take the nine listed securities company in A-share as the research object to measure the risk spillover effect between listed securities and securities industry; Finally, according to the result of empirical analysis, this paper obtain the related conclusion.",
