  "title": "Computer-supported portfolio analysis and comparison using ontology-based patent classification mapping scheme: the case of mobile communication patent pools",
  "abstract": "Mobile communication patents must conform to LTE-Advanced (called fourth generation or 4G) specifications to be categorized as LTE-A standard essential patents (SEPs). Global LTE-A patent pools, such as Sisvel and Via Licensing, collect SEPs from patent assignees, facilitate the SEP licensing processes, and provide fast-forward technical solutions to licensees. This research develops a computer-supported ontology-based patent classification (ontology-IPC) mapping scheme. Two major LTE-A patent pools (Sisvel and Via Licensing) and a national research project pool provide the case study. The research methodology defines the patent pool profiles using visualization maps for collaborative SEPs licensing and provides critical data to avoid re-inventing technologies and infringing upon existing intellectual property. The research enables mobile network and device developers to work cooperatively to develop fast, dependable, and interoperable products and services. The ontology-IPC analysis of the data demonstrates the approach's versatile application to support national project research reviews.",
