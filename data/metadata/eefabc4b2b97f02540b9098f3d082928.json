  "title": "Network Risk Parity: graph theory-based portfolio construction",
  "abstract": "This study presents network risk parity, a graph theory-based portfolio construction methodology that arises from a thoughtful critique of the clustering-based approach used by hierarchical risk parity. Advantages of network risk parity include: the ability to capture one-to-many relationships between securities, overcoming the one-to-one limitation; the capacity to leverage the mathematics of graph theory, which enables us, among other things, to demonstrate that the resulting portfolios is less concentrated than those obtained with mean-variance; and the ability to simplify the model specification by eliminating the dependency on the selection of a distance and linkage function. Performance-wise, due to a better representation of systematic risk within the minimum spanning tree, network risk parity outperforms hierarchical risk parity and other competing methods, especially as the number of portfolio constituents increases.",
