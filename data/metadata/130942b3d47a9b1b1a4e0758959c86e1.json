  "title": "Research on the Development of Hospital Intelligent Finance Based on Artificial Intelligence",
  "abstract": "Based on the development background of the interweaving and integration of computer technology and Internet technology, China's artificial intelligence industry is quietly rising. In the social life of the information age, the artificial intelligence industry represented by machine deep learning is playing a very important role. This study in combination with the background of the new health reform, in view of the reform of the medical industry, analyzes the connotation of financial wisdom based on the important role of the hospital financial development problems, puts forward the development direction of artificial intelligence hospital financial wisdom development measures, designed to meet the changing external environment demand, reduces human costs, and improves the overall efficiency of hospital financial fund management. Based on the evaluation results, this paper proposes the correct direction for the development of hospital intelligence finance by using the BP neural network model. After the analysis, it is found that the development of artificial intelligence is an important measure to promote the development of hospital intelligent finance. In other words, hospital intelligent financial management is the product of the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology. At the present stage, the intelligent financial management problems of hospitals are mainly as follows: (1) lack of financial informatization, (2) lack of perfect financial risk early warning system, and (3) the phenomenon of information island in the financial system. After analyzing the above problems, the research believes that the development of hospital intelligent finance based on artificial intelligence needs to solve the above thorny problems, so as to improve the outcome of hospital intelligent finance development. The following work should be done: (1) strengthen the design of information sharing module, (2) intelligent control of the cost of hospitals, and (3) intelligent treatment of hospital accounting. Combining the development of artificial intelligence and hospital intelligent finance theory, combined with the actual trend of financial intelligence development under the background of artificial intelligence development in the new era, it provides scientific basis for the development of hospital intelligent finance.",
