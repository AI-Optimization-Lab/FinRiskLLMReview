  "title": "MAXIMO: A GOAL-BASED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION APPLICATION",
  "abstract": "In India, financial planning is considered to be a complicated concept. Most of the people are neither aware of the different investment options nor well off to pay the exorbitant fees of professional financial advisors. We propose MAXIMO, an application that provides tailor-made advice based on the user's income structure, expenditures, responsibilities, risk sensitivity, and goals. The application will diversify the user's capital into varied instruments of investments like Government and Corporate Bonds, Mutual Funds, Stock Market, and Gold. Machine learning-based prediction techniques are used for predicting the future values of these instruments. The proposed application is a means to provide customized financial planning to people who don't want to take any undue risk but still thrive to achieve their financial goals.",
