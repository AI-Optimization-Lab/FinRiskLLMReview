  "title": "Knowledge Production and Polluted Soil in Urban Planning: The Case of Helsinki",
  "abstract": "Knowledge production concerning local environmental problems could be more transparent. Polluted soil as an environmental problem is examined in cases from three different decades in Helsinki. The research material comprises official and public documents, such as planning documents, records of the City Board and interviews with the city's authorities. The themes of the interviews were decided after a preliminary analysis of the document data. The analysis focuses on changes in problem classification, knowledge production, risk management and the dynamics between these. Risk management and knowledge production are argued to have been conducted in a way that masks environmental problems, their historical roots and their causes from citizens and decision-makers. Furthermore, the risk management strategy transformed ecological risks into financial risks.",
