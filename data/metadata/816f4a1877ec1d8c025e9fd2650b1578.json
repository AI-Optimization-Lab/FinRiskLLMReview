  "title": "Classification Method of Regional Differentiation Characteristics of Enterprise Management",
  "abstract": "In the face of the risks and challenges brought by the downward pressure and regional differentiation, it is necessary to improve the enterprise management system, promote the reform of the financial system, create institutional conditions, and enhance the endurance of local finance and economy in order to prevent and resolve major risks. This paper puts forward the classification method of regional differentiation characteristics of enterprise management. Starting from the industrial and commercial management system, this paper further analyzes the characteristics of the rising trend of regional differentiation and the deep-seated causes of risk classification, and puts forward the general idea of preventing and resolving risks. This paper puts forward the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions from the aspects of improving the industrial and commercial management system, promoting the integration of fairness and efficiency, adjusting the direction of industrial and commercial management, and accelerating the reform of financial system.",
