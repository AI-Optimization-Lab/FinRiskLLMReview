  "title": "Board Characteristics and Bank's Portfolio Risk",
  "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the effect of the characteristics of boards on bank portfolio risk. Using data from 74 commercial banks in Indonesia in 2011-2017, this research performs panel data regression. The result of data analysis using panel data fixed-effect model shows that the characteristics of directors, age, gender, and the education level have influences on bank portfolio risk. Moreover, bank-specific factors such as the size of the managed public savings, the number of loans granted, the level of profitability also have significant effects on the level of bank risk. These results indicate that the characteristics of the board of directors, as the specific factors of banks, influence the level of risk of banks in Indonesia.",
