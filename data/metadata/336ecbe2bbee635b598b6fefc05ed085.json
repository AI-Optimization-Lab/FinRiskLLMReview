  "title": "Financial Behavior and its Impact on Financial Well-being among Muslim University Students",
  "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of financial behaviour on financial well-being of university students at University Malaysia Terengganu (UMT). Financial behaviour which includes saving, spending, debt management and financial planning in shaping financial well-being of young adults. However, despite growing interest in financial literacy, the relationship between student financial behaviour and financial well-being remains under- explored. A sample of 102 Muslim student from various academics disciplinary and year of enrolment, which include those with and without financial background was surveyed. The data will be analysed using Social Science Software (SPSS) for descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple regression. This research focuses on identifying patterns student behaviour and examines how the behaviour impact their ability to meet financial obligations, risk and financial goal to achieve them. The finding of this research will provide insight into the financial behaviour that promote better financial well-being among university students. The results are expected to contribute design of target positive financial behaviour and improve overall financial well-being of student in higher education institution.",
