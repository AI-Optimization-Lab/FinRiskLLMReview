  "title": "A 2020 baseline assessment for the monitoring of the End TB indicator of catastrophic costs in Burkina Faso",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prior assessment of the economic burden of TB showed high risk of catastrophic costs in Burkina Faso. A decade later, the National TB Programme conducted the first national patient cost survey, establishing a baseline for future policymaking.METHODS: A national TB patient cost survey was conducted early 2020. Following WHO methods, a structured questionnaire was administered to 465 patients (20 clusters) to report on the direct and indirect costs of TB, household income and coping strategies adopted by the TB-affected families. The share of households facing catastrophic costs was assessed. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with catastrophic costs due to TB.RESULTS: One in two (54.4%) TB-affected households in Burkina Faso faced catastrophic costs, resulting in major improvements over the past decade. On average, households incurred in US$962.64 per episode of care (respectively US$741.7, US$122.3 and US$98.6 for indirect, direct medical and non-medical costs), leaving substantial costs requiring mitigation strategies (39.8%). Major risk factors were associated with hospitalisation and wealth-related variables. Job loss, food insecurity and other social consequences were also experienced.CONCLUSION: Despite progress, reducing the End TB indicator of catastrophic costs remains central to policymaking to ensure effective financial protection in Burkina Faso.",
