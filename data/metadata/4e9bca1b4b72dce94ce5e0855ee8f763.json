  "title": "Investigating the impact of board characteristics on money laundering Evidence from Iranian listed companies",
  "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of board characteristics on money laundering in Iranian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach This was a descriptive-correlational study, and in terms of purpose, it was an applied research. The statistical population of this study was all companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange during the years 2012-2018. A sample of 150 companies was selected by screening method. Data analysis and hypothesis testing were performed using logistic regression and Eviews 10. Findings The results indicated that the board bonus and CEO duality (chief executive officer duality) had a significant effect on money laundering. CEO gender also had a significant effect on money laundering. Originality/value Sound management of risks related to money laundering by the board of directors is associated with stability, soundness and overall health of a country's financial system, which enables the integrity of the international financial system by meeting the Basel Committee goals, including strengthening the regulations, monitoring and improving current procedures, promoting financial stability and maintaining and enhancing a good corporate reputation; however, banks and other financial institutions are exposed to more serious risks, especially the reputation risk, operational risk, etc., if management does not play an effective role in the fight against money laundering. If management considers efficient and risk-driven policies and procedures in the fight against money laundering, then many problems and losses as well as many costs, including failure to collect receivables and to bring legal proceedings, can be prevented.",
