  "title": "Android-IoT Malware Classification and Detection Approach Using Deep URL Features Analysis",
  "abstract": "Currently, malware attacks pose a high risk to compromise the security of Android-IoT apps. These threats have the potential to steal critical information, causing economic, social, and financial harm. Because of their constant availability on the network, Android apps are easily attacked by URL-based traffic. In this paper, an Android malware classification and detection approach using deep and broad URL feature mining is proposed. This study entails the development of a novel traffic data preprocessing and transformation method that can detect malicious apps using network traffic analysis. The encrypted URL-based traffic is mined to decrypt the transmitted data. To extract the sequenced features, the N-gram analysis method is used, and afterward, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is utilized to reduce the features while preserving the actual semantics. The latent features are extracted using the latent semantic analysis tool. Finally, CNN-LSTM, a multi-view deep learning approach, is designed for effective malware classification and detection.",
