  "title": "Unconventional Monetary Policy, Bank Lending, and Security Holdings: The Yield-Induced Portfolio-Rebalancing Channel",
  "abstract": "This article studies the impact of unconventional monetary policy on bank lending and security holdings. I exploit granular security register data and use a difference- in-differences regression setup to provide evidence for a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing: Banks experiencing large average yield declines in their securities portfolio, induced by unconventional monetary policy, increase their real-sector lending more strongly relative to other banks. The effect is stronger for banks facing many reinvestment decisions. Moreover, I find that banks with large yield declines reduce their government bond holdings and sell securities bought under the asset-purchase program of the European Central Bank (ECB).",
