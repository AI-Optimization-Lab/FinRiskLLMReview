  "title": "ACCENTUATING THE IMPACTS OF POLITICAL NEWS ON THE STOCK PRICE, WORKING CAPITAL AND PERFORMANCE: AN EMPIRICAL REVIEW OF EMERGING ECONOMY",
  "abstract": "There is a paucity of academic studies on the impact of political news on stock returns, working capital, and firm performance. This study looks into the impact of previous political news on stock behavior in the future. For the empirical analysis, we used a data set of Pakistani non-financial listed firms from 2009 to 2018. We found a substantial positive effect of political news on the future stock returns, working capital, and firm performance using a portfolio, panel, and two-stage least square regression approach.",
