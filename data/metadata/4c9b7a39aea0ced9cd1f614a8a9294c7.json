  "title": "THE MAIN INDICATORS USED IN THE FINANCING OF THE CONSTANTA COUNTY CLINIC EMERGENCY HOSPITAL",
  "abstract": "The DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (DRG) system is only an instrument that can be used for the assessment of the activity results of hospitals and for their financing. In order to implement the DRG system the first step must always be to define the health policies and the aims in view. The second step is to select and apply the DRG system based on the desired purposes and the tender spots of the chosen pattern. The DRG financing may be made either retrospectively or prospectively depending on how one desire to share the financial risk between creditor and hospital. The hospital implements the DRG classification in order to obtain a better image of its results and to compare same with other hospitals results.",
