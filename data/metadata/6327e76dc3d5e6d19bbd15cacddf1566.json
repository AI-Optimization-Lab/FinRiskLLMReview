  "title": "Ownership effects among Native American banks, 2001-2016",
  "abstract": "Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), including Native American Banks (NatBs), play an integral role in providing financial services to the under-served. NatBs are split between those that are Tribal owned and those owned by individual Native Americans as private banks. This research explores differences between the two, other MDIs and comparable mainstream banks, using data from 2001 to 2016. Tribal NatBs are hypothesized to emphasize community development for the under-served over profit maximization, and to take on high levels of risk. Testing uses comparisons of population means and regressions, and the overall pattern of results and limited regression findings support those possibilities.",
