  "abstract": "Financial storm in Wall Street led to the global economic crisis and China's SME are faced with enormous pressure and challenges. Income tax planning is an important aspect of financial management. On the basis of China's national conditions, this paper firstly analyze the research and the implementation of China's SME income tax planning with classification analysis method, then probes into effective ways of tax planning income of China's SME, and finally defines problems and risk prevention what China's enterprises should pay attention to in the specific operation in income tax planning.",
