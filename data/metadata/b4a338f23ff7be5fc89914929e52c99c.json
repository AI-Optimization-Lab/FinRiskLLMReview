  "title": "Trends and determinants of use of long-acting reversible contraception use among young women in France: results from three national surveys conducted between 2000 and 2010",
  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate trends and determinants in the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), including intrauterine devices and implants, over the last decade among young women in France. Design: Data drawn from three cross-sectional national probability surveys. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): A total of 1,204 women, ages 15 to 29, who are at potential risk of an unintended pregnancy in 2000; 1,921 in 2005; and 1,281 in 2010. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Logistic regression models were used to explore trends in LARC use since 2000 and to examine determinants of LARC use in 2010. Result(s): A minority of women were using LARC methods, with a significant increase between 2000 and 2010, from 4.6% to 6.4%. The odds of LARC use in 2010 were higher among women 20 to 29 years, parous women, women with a history of unintended pregnancy, women in difficult financial situations, smokers, and women in the care of a gynecologist. Conclusion(s): This study shows that little progress has been made in LARC use among young women in France, despite these methods being widely available and reimbursed by the national health system.
