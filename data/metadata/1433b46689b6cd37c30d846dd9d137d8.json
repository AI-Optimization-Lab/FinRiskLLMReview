  "title": "Innovative Methodology for Elevating Big Data Analysis and Security",
  "abstract": "big amount of data and information transfer among, within, and through organizations all over the globe. This big data information may include sensitive, confidential and restricted data, like financial, legal or private information. Any loss, threat, or leakage of information may trigger high-security risk on such data. Securing big data during analysis phase is still a challenge, especially in cloud systems. This paper proposes a methodology to protect big data during analysis, by classifying data before any action such as moving, copying or processing can take place. Based on big data classification, the security procedures will be activated according to data level criticality.",
