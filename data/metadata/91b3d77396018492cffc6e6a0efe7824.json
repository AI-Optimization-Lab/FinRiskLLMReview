  "title": "Trends in hospitalization for alcoholic hepatitis from 2011 to 2017: A USA nationwide study",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the most lethal manifestations of alcohol-associated liver disease. In light of the increase in alcohol consumption worldwide, the incidence of AH is on the rise, and data examining the trends of AH admission is needed. AIM To examine inpatient admission trends secondary to AH, along with their clinical outcomes and epidemiological characteristics. METHODS The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was utilized, and data from 2011 to 2017 were reviewed. We included individuals aged >= 21 years who were admitted with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AH using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and its correspondent ICD-10 codes. Hepatitis not related to alcohol was excluded. The national estimates of inpatient admissions were obtained using sample weights provided by the NIS. RESULTS AH-related hospitalization demonstrated a significant increase in the USA from 281506(0.7% of the total admission in 2011) to 324050 (0.9% of the total admission in 2017). The median age was 54 years. The most common age group was 45-65 years (range 57.8%-60.7%). The most common race was white (63.2%-66.4%), and patients were predominantly male (69.7%-71.2%). The primary healthcare payers were Medicare (29.4%-30.7%) and Medicaid (21.5%-32.5%). The most common geographical location was the Southern USA (33.6%-34.4%). Most patients were admitted to a tertiary care center (50.2%-62.3%) located in urban areas. Mortality of AH in this inpatient sample was 5.3% in 2011 and 5.5% in 2017. The most common mortality-associated risk factors were acute renal failure (59.6%-72.1%) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (17.2%-20.3%). The total charges were noted to range between $25242.62 and $34874.50. CONCLUSION The number of AH inpatient hospitalizations significantly increased from 2011 to 2017. This could have a substantial financial impact with increasing healthcare costs and utilization. AH-mortality remained the same.",
