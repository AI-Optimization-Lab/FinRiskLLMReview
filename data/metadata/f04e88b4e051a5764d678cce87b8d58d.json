  "title": "Research on the Systematic Risk of Real Estate Listed Companies in China: Based on Financial Perspective",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we used all the A-share real estate listed companies in China as the sample. Based on the micro-company's financial data of the year 2015-2016, we selected 15 financial indicators to carry on the factor analysis, and 5 common factors, including the profitability factor, the solvency factor, and the growth ability factor, were extracted. We used multiple common linear regression models with five common factors and systemic risk indicators calculated by the capital asset pricing models, and the study found that the common factors had a significant impact on the systemic risk of the real estate listed companies in China and the impact level of the common factors on systemic risk.",
