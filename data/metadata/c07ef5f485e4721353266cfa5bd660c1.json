  "title": "Mapping the knowledge structure of artificial neural network research in the stock market: a bibliometric analysis and future research pathways",
  "abstract": "Purpose - In past decades, artificial neural network (ANN) models have revolutionised various stock market operations due to their superior ability to deal with nonlinear data and garnered considerable attention from researchers worldwide. The present study aims to synthesize the research field concerning ANN applications in the stock market to a) systematically map the research trends, key contributors, scientific collaborations, and knowledge structure, and b) uncover the challenges and future research areas in the field. Design/methodology/approach - To provide a comprehensive appraisal of the extant literature, the study adopted the mixed approach of quantitative (bibliometric analysis) and qualitative (intensive review of influential articles) assessment to analyse 1,483 articles published in the Scopus and Web of Science indexed journals during 1992-2022. The bibliographic data was processed and analysed using VOSviewer and R software. Findings - The results revealed the proliferation of articles since 2018, with China as the dominant country, Wang J as the most prolific author, Expert Systems with Applications as the leading journal, computer science as the dominant subject area, and stock price forecasting as the predominantly explored research theme in the field. Furthermore, portfolio optimization, sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and crisis prediction are found as recently emerged research areas. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is a novel attempt that holistically assesses the existing literature on ANN applications throughout the entire domain of stock market. The main contribution of the current study lies in discussing the challenges along with the viable methodological solutions and providing application area-wise knowledge gaps for future studies.",
