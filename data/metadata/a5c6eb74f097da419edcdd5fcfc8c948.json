  "title": "A Methodology for Investigating Opportunities for Service Technologies",
  "abstract": "This study proposes a new approach for investigating opportunities for service technologies through analyzing business method patents. First, technological interrelationship matrices of co-occurrence, relatedness, and cross-impact perspectives are constructed by conducting an association rule mining on the co-classification information of patent data. Second, the analytic network process is applied to the constructed technological interrelationship matrices in order to produce the importance values of service technologies from each perspective, considering their direct and indirect interrelationships. Third, data envelopment analysis is employed to the derived importance values in order to identify priorities of service technologies, putting three perspectives together. Finally, promising service technologies are investigated with portfolio analysis. The proposed approach could guide and help managers of firms to discover opportunities for service technologies.",
