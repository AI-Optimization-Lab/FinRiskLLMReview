  "title": "Quantile forecasts for financial volatilities based on parametric and asymmetric models",
  "abstract": "For financial volatilities such as realized volatility and volatility index, a new parametric quantile forecast strategy is proposed, focusing on forecast interval and value at risk (VaR) forecast. This fully addresses asymmetries in 3 parts: mean, volatility and distribution. The asymmetries are addressed by the LHAR (leverage heterogeneous autoregressive) model of McAleer and Medeiros (2008) and Corsi and Reno (2009) for the mean part, by the EGARCH model for the volatility part, and by the skew-t distribution for the error distribution part. The method is applied to the realized volatilities and the volatility indexes of the US S&P 500 index, the US NASDAQ index, the Korea KOSPI index in which significant asymmetries are identified. Considerable out-of-sample forecast improvements of the forecast interval and VaR forecast are demonstrated for the volatilities: forecast intervals of volatilities have better coverages with shorter lengths and VaR forecasts of volatility indexes have better violations if asymmetries are properly addressed rather than ignored. The proposed parametric method reveals considerably better out-of-sample performance than the recently proposed semiparametric quantile regression approach of Zikes and Barunik (2016).
