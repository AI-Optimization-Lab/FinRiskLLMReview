  "title": "A Peak Price Tracking-Based Learning System for Portfolio Selection",
  "abstract": "We propose a novel linear learning system based on the peak price tracking (PPT) strategy for portfolio selection (PS). Recently, the topic of tracking control attracts intensive attention and some novel models are proposed based on backstepping methods, such that the system output tracks a desired trajectory. The proposed system has a similar evolution with a transform function that aggressively tracks the increasing power of different assets. As a result, the better performing assets will receive more investment. The proposed PPT objective can be formulated as a fast backpropagation algorithm, which is suitable for large-scale and time-limited applications, such as high-frequency trading. Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets from diverse real financial markets show that PPT outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in computational time, cumulative wealth, and risk-adjusted metrics. It suggests that PPT is effective and even more robust than some defensive systems in PS.",
