  "title": "Relationships between Livelihood Risks and Livelihood Capitals: A Case Study in Shiyang River Basin, China",
  "abstract": "Using information collected through semi-structured questionnaires in 483 households, this paper examines the relationships between livelihood risks and livelihood capitals amongst rural farming communities in China's Shiyang River Basin. Based on an index system of livelihood risks (health, environmental, financial, social, information and connectivity risks) and livelihood capitals (human, physical and natural, financial and social capitals), relationships are measured and evaluated through a linear regression model. Results suggest that health risk and social risk have clear negative effects on livelihood capitals. This finding may support evidence-based policies intended to reduce health risk and social risk threats as well as underpinning improvements in rural farmers' capacities to withstand livelihood risk and to enhance well-being.",
