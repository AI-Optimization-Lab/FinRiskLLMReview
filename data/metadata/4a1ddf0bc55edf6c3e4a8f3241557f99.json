  "title": "Security Consideration of BIA Utilization in Smart Electricity Metering Systems",
  "abstract": "Smart electricity metering is a modern component of distribution networks, whereby it enables efficient management of the distribution system based on actual requirements and reporting of actual electricity consumption to the customer and the market regulator. It is a relatively complex issue encompassing wide range of technologies, business processes and legislative requirements. In order to create an effective Smart Metering System, it is advisable to use Business impact analysis to analyse the efficiency of data usage and the impacts of non-availability or loss of data in the power system. By implementing a BIA, distribution companies operating in the EU market reduce the risk of financial losses caused by non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An integral part of this is the establishment of security and mitigation measures to ensure a non-penalizing system of data transfer to the regulatory authorities in the energy sector. The main objective of the paper is to establish a model for data classification and its use in the BIA in the field of smart metering.",
