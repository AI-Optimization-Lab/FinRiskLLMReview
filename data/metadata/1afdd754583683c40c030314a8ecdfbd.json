  "title": "An R & D Project Dealing with Mechanical Bits and Pieces in Real Option Analysis",
  "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to study the R&D project under incomplete information. We extend the multi-step quadrinomial option pricing model through a practical case, which is the R&D project of the machinery to deal with mechanical bits and pieces. We pricing the real options valuation (ROV) of the project and show a decision tree, which can provide managers flexible decisions to analyze technology and market uncertainty.",
