  "title": "Evaluation of Parametric ES Tests",
  "abstract": "Since the beginning of the 21st century the theory of statistics offers a consistent, coherent methodology of risk measurement, based on the axiomatic risk definition. The central point of the axiomatic risk theory is the idea of the Expected Shortfall (ES), which is a risk measure that fulfils the set of coherency axioms. Since the inception of ES on the turn of the 21st century, numerous estimation methods has been developed and discussed, while testing procedures are still relatively few. As sample ES measure is calculated as the average value over a given threshold, the relevant distribution is unknown. Thus statistical evaluation of the ES model cannot use the natural measure of discrepancy between estimated and empirical ES. Hypothesis testing uses other means like regression approach, saddlepoint technique for approximate p-values or the goodness of fit of the truncated return density. The study presents parametric methods of statistical inference connected with ES measure and, through the simulation study, gives the comparison of the size and power of the considered tests. In order to reflect the stylized facts about real financial processes, simulation experiments are based on the GARCH processes.",
