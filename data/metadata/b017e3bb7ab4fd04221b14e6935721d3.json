  "title": "FORECASTING MODELS FOR DEFAULT RISK. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON INDUSTRIAL FIRMS IN CAMPANIA",
  "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to investigate several aspects of bankruptcy prediction within both theoretical and empirical frameworks. In particular, we are interested in analysing the predictability of default risk for industrial firms throughout the Campania region. Multivariate classification techniques were applied to a data-set of financial statements of a balanced sample of failed and healthy industrial enterprises for a given time period. The empirical findings on the predictive power of financial ratios aim to contribute to the elaboration of efficient prevention and recovery strategies in the area of interest.",
