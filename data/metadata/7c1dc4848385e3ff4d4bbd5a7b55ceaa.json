  "title": "Variation in stem form and risk of four commercially important hardwood species in the Acadian Forest: implications for potential sawlog volume and tree classification systems",
  "abstract": "Northern hardwood trees display a wide variety of stem forms and defects, which can substantially reduce their financial value and also complicate their silviculture. While attributes of stem form and defect have been incorporated into tree classification systems, their ability to assess product value and recovery in standing trees has not been adequately tested. To address this issue, we classified stem form and risk using a system developed by the Northern Hardwoods Research Institute (NHRI) for four species across several locations in Maine, New Hampshire, and New Brunswick: sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton), and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Using these data, we (i) quantified interspecific and regional variation in stem form and damage, (ii) related potential sawlog recovery to tree size, form, and risk, and (iii) compared the efficacy of the NHRI system with a commonly used classification system and a continuous measure of stem quality. High variation in both stem form and damage among the species was found, with red maple showing the largest range. A simplified NHRI system including three form classes proved to be sufficient in differentiating sawlog potential in individual trees, while a model using a continuous measure of stem quality (estimated merchantable sawlog height) performed best.",
