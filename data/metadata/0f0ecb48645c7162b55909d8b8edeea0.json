  "title": "Option Volatility Investment Strategy: The Combination of Neural Network and Classical Volatility Prediction Model",
  "abstract": "This study focuses on the volatility prediction and option volatility investment. By investigating the traditional Volatility Prediction Model and machine learning algorithms, this study tries to merge these two aspects together. This work setup a bridge of previous financial studies and machine learning studies by proposing an algorithm integrating neural network and three traditional volatility models, called Quantile based neural network and model integration combination algorithm. The algorithm effectively lowers the volatility prediction error (measured by root of mean square error, shorted for RMSE: 0.319724) and beat the Wavenet (RMSE: 0.44) which is the benchmark and surpasses integrated model (RMSE: 0.348346) in test set. In terms of option investment strategy, this paper constructs a CSI 300 index option portfolio which hedges the underlying asset price risk and exposes the volatility risk. Then propose the Option strategy of volatility prediction with dynamic thresholds. With the new algorithm above, the strategy improves the return-risk ratio in test set (measured by Sharpe ratio: 1.99-2.07).",
