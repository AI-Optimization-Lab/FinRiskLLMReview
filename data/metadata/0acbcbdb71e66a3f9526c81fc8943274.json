  "title": "Bank regulatory capital and liquidity creation: evidence from BRICS countries",
  "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between bank regulatory capital and liquidity creation in banks of BIRCS countries. Design/methodology/approach - Data from all publicly listed banks of BRICS nations for the period 2003-2014 have been collected and analyzed. Two-stage least-squares regression has been used to control endogeneity. The econometric model includes different control variables that have been selected based on the extant literature. Findings - Increase in bank capital negatively affects bank liquidity creation which implies that financial fragility-crowding out hypothesis holds for banks of BRICS countries. Originality/value - This study provides the evidence of the inverse relationship between bank regulatory capital and liquidity creation from emerging economies. The findings show that there is a trade-off between curtailing bank risk taking and liquidity creation. Therefore, the regulators must formulate policies to strike a balance between the two.",
