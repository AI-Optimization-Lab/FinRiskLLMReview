  "title": "EFFECT OF LIVELIHOOD RISK ON RISK-COPING STRATEGIES: CASE STUDY IN SHIYANG RIVER BASIN",
  "abstract": "This study examined the effect of livelihood risk on the options for livelihood strategies in rural farming communities in China's Shiyang River Basin. Using data collected from semi-structured interviews with 483 households, this study identified the effect of livelihood risk on livelihood strategies. By establishing an index system of livelihood risk (health, environmental, financial, social, and information and connectivity risks) and livelihood strategy (convert assets into cash, use loans, reduce consumption, let children drop out of school, go out to work and wait for government relief), this effect was measured and evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. The results indicated that health risk, environmental risk, and financial risk were significantly correlated with the options for livelihood strategies. Meanwhile, social risk and information and connectivity risk were not significantly correlated with options for livelihood strategies. These findings can support evidence-based policies that induce farmers to not only adopt more effective livelihood strategies and improve their well-being but also to establish specialized associations to improve their capacities and broaden their stock of livelihood strategies to mitigate livelihood risk.",
