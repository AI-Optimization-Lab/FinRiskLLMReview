  "title": "Factors associated with long bone fracture healing complications (delayed union, nonunion and malunions) in Arar, Saudi Arabia: A case control study",
  "abstract": "Background: Bone fractures are the commonest cause of hospitalized trauma. Fracture healing complications (FHC) is frequently associated pain, restricts the patient's activities, increases dependency and financial burden. This study aimed to identify factors which can affect fracture healing. Subject and methods: A nested case-cohort hospital-based study conducted patients (above the age 20 years) who were treated for acute fractures of long bones. 31 patients diagnosed with FHC (delayed union fracture) were chosen as cases and 124 Patients with normal fracture healing were included as controls. Results: By logistic regression analysis, smoking, age of the patient, gender, open fracture and diabetes were found to be independently associated with FHC. Conclusion: Smoking, age of the patient, gender; open fracture and diabetes were found to be the important risk factors of FHC.",
