  "title": "Colorectal cancer screening practices among cancer survivors five years after diagnosis",
  "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high incidence worldwide, especially in high-income countries. In France, a national CRC screening program targeting residents aged 50-74 years has been in place since 2009. Little is known about CRC screening practices in cancer survivors, even though some have an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the colorectum. This study aims to identify the barriers to CRC screening among cancer survivors. Methods This cross-sectional study based on the French national VICAN survey included individuals diagnosed in 2010 with a cancer in 1 of 11 locations other than the colorectum and interviewed 5 years after diagnosis about various health-related issues. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with lack of up-to-date CRC screening in cancer survivors without cancer progression. Results Of the 2935 cancer survivors included in the study, 35.3% reported undergoing a screening test in the previous 2 years. The rate of up-to-date CRC screening rose to 49.3% in survivors aged 51-75 years. Among these, lack of CRC screening in the recommended time frame was associated with obesity, current smoking, non-use of complementary medicine, perceived financial difficulties, and poor access to general practitioners. Conclusions Barriers to CRC screening can be personal and/or institutional.",
