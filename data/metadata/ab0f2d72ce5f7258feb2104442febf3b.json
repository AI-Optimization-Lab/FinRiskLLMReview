  "title": "Beyond Age and Sex: Enhancing Annuity Pricing",
  "abstract": "This paper examines the use of more extensive risk classification and its impact on annuitisation values in consumer markets with mortality heterogeneity. Prices of U.S. retail annuities do not currently reflect buyers' attributes other than age and sex. I qualitatively assess a number of proposed underwriting factors and show that the factors chosen can robustly predict mortality heterogeneity in a hazards framework. The relative value of annuities across demographic groups converges considerably under finer-grained pricing, but the change in consumers' well-being is asymmetric. Shorter-lived annuitants gain about 30 per cent in financial and utility-adjusted terms, whereas longer-lived annuitants experience losses of 16 per cent.",
