  "title": "Association of stressful life events with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus",
  "abstract": "Aims/IntroductionThis study was carried out to investigate the relationship of stressful life events (SLEs) with the risk of cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and MethodsA total of 316 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged >45 years were recruited in this study, and data on demographics, medical history, lifestyle characteristics and SLEs were collected. The cognitive status of patients was evaluated with a battery of cognitive function scales. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the risk and protective factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ResultsParticipants, including 217 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with MCI and 99 patients without MCI, were enrolled in the current study. Among the SLEs, the death of an offspring or parent (odds ratio [OR] 1.994, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.017-3.908) was a risk factor for MCI after adjustment for age and education level. In the subgroup of participants aged <60 years, the death of an offspring or parent (OR 2.731, 95% CI 1.119-6.665) and financial difficulty (OR 22.205, 95% CI 4.365-112.966) were risk factors for the development of MCI, whereas high working pressure (OR 0.154, 95% CI 0.048-0.495) and career changes (OR 0.324, 95% CI 0.124-0.847) were protective factors for MCI. ConclusionsThese data suggested that SLEs were associated with cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adverse life events, such as the death of an offspring or parent, were risk factors for cognitive impairment, whereas high work pressure in middle-aged people was a protective factor against cognitive impairment.",
