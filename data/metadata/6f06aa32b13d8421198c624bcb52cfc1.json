  "title": "The Relationship Between Children's Gender Composition and Parents' All-Cause Mortality Among Older Adults in Korea",
  "abstract": "Using data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 3,356 participants aged 65 or older) and estimating Cox proportional hazard regression models, this study investigated the association between gender composition of children and parents' mortality risk. This study showed that compared with having both daughters and sons, having exclusively daughters (but not exclusively sons) was associated with higher mortality risk. This association, however, was significant for mothers, but not for fathers. To shed light on source of this association, this study distinguished between mothers with only daughters who receive and do not receive regular financial support from children. Results showed that mothers had elevated mortality risk only if they do not receive regular financial support from their children. Traditional caregiving roles of sons for older parents in Korea may lead to a mortality disadvantage among mothers of daughters vis-a-vis a reduction in financial assistance from children.",
