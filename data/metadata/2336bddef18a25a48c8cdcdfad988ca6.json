  "title": "Factors Associated With Sleep Disturbances Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Older Adults With Chronic Conditions",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to sleep problems among older adults with chronic conditions. We examined factors linked to pandemic related sleep disturbances in a US sample of adults aged 50 and older with chronic conditions. Design: Cross-sectional anonymous online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. Setting: Michigan (82.3% of participants) and 33 other US states. Participants: Total of 705 adults (M = 64.57 years, SD = 8.82, range = 50-94) who reported at least one chronic condition. Measurements: Sociodemographic and health characteristics, physical activity, media use, pandemic-related stress, social resources, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. Results: In the fully adjusted regression models, people who reported more worry about COVID-19 infection, more financial strain, and greater loneliness reported significantly greater pandemic-related sleep disturbances. Conclusions: These findings identify factors that may heighten risk of sleep problems since the COVID-19 pandemic in an especially vulnerable subgroup of older adults.",
