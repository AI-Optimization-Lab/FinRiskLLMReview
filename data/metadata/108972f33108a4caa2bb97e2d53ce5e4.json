  "title": "Sequential tracking in pricing financial options using model based and neural network approaches",
  "abstract": "This paper shows how the prices of option contracts traded in financial markets can be tracked sequentially by means of the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm. I consider call and put. option pairs with identical strike price and time of maturity as a two output nonlinear system. The Black-Scholes approach popular in Finance literature and the Radial Basis Functions neural network are used in modelling the nonlinear system generating these observations. I show how both these systems may be identified recursively using the EKF algorithm. I present results of simulations on some FTSE 100 Index options data and discuss the implications of viewing the pricing problem in this sequential manner.",
