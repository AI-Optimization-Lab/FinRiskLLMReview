  "title": "Mental health in Ukraine in 2023",
  "abstract": "Background Very little is known about the mental health of the adult population of Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of seven mental health disorders, the proportion of adults screening positive for any disorder, and the sociodemographic factors associated with meeting requirements for each and any disorder.Methods A non-probability quota sample (N = 2,050) of adults living in Ukraine in September 2023 was collected online. Participants completed self-report questionnaires of the seven mental health disorders. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of the different disorders.Results Prevalence estimates ranged from 1.5% (cannabis use disorder) to 15.2% (generalized anxiety disorder), and 36.3% screened positive for any of the seven disorders. Females were significantly more likely than males (39.0% vs. 33.8%) to screen positive for any disorder. Disruption to life due to Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, greater financial worries, and having fewer positive childhood experiences were consistent risk factors for different mental health disorders and for any or multiple disorders.Conclusion Our findings show that approximately one in three adults living in Ukraine report problems consistent with meeting diagnostic requirements for a mental health disorder 18 months after Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine's mental healthcare system has been severely compromised by the loss of infrastructure and human capital due to the war. These findings may help to identify those most vulnerable so that limited resources can be used most effectively.",
