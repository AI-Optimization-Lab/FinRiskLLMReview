  "title": "Surgical treatment of spinal metastases",
  "abstract": "Background The spine represents a central organ in the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. Due to improved control of primary tumors, the incidence of spinal metastases is increasing. Metastatic involvement of the spine can affect both stability and neurologic function, and contribute significantly to patient morbidity, making spinal surgical management of these metastases a challenge that should be addressed by an interdisciplinary team. Materials and methods The surgical options for the treatment of spinal metastases are presented in the context of overall oncologic therapy. Results The different surgical options, starting with biopsy, decompression, separation surgery, dorsal and ventral instrumentation and decompression have their place in the management of spinal metastases, as do augmentation and ablation. Classification systems help to identify the correct surgical treatment option. For optimal care, an interdisciplinary team should have at its disposal the entire portfolio of surgical options. Conclusion The treatment of spinal metastases requires the involvement of all necessary disciplines. Interdisciplinarity is only possible in specialized centers or clinics with very good integration into an oncological network.",
