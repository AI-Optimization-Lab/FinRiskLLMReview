  "title": "Nonlinear Monte Carlo Schemes for Counterparty Risk on Credit Derivatives",
  "abstract": "Two nonlinear Monte Carlo schemes, namely, the linear Monte Carlo expansion with randomization of Fujii and Takahashi (Int J Theor Appl Financ 15(5):1250034(24), 2012 [9], Q J Financ 2(3), 1250015(24), 2012, [10]) and the marked branching diffusion scheme of Henry-Labordere (Risk Mag 25(7), 67-73, 2012, [13]), are compared in terms of applicability and numerical behavior regarding counterparty risk computations on credit derivatives. This is done in two dynamic copula models of portfolio credit risk: the dynamic Gaussian copula model and the model in which default dependence stems from joint defaults. For such high-dimensional and nonlinear pricing problems, more standard deterministic or simulation/regression schemes are ruled out by Bellman's curse of dimensionality and only purely forward Monte Carlo schemes can be used.",
