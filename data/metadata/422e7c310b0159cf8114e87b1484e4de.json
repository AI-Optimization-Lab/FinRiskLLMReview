  "abstract": "Background: Community based health insurance (CBHI) schemes are increasingly recognized as potential strategy for achieving health coverage in developing countries. Health insurance is also expected to afford financial protection because it reduces the risk associated with falling ill. A community based cross-sectional study design was employed. Multistage cluster, simple random, and systematic sampling techniques were used. A simple random sampling procedure was used tochoose the sampled household heads. The variables were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value < 0.05, used to determine the strength of the association. This study had 285 participants, with a response rate of 96.3% out of a total of 296 sampled study participants. 90.9% of repondents were willing to join, and 89.8% were willing to pay CBHI. Based on findings joining CBHI membership provided benefits such as lower out of pocket cost (86.8%), improved health status (8.3%), reduced severity risk (2.3%), and increased productivity (2.6%). This study showed that willingness to join CBHI was higher than the findings of an other study conducted in Ethiopia. These findings are helpful for planning as well as expanding the sceme through outthe country. The main challenges to health service utilization in government health facilities are a lack of available medicine, poor service delivery, lack of laboratories, health personnel improper behavior, and ashortage of ambulance services. To address such concerns, the government should be encouraged health care access.",
