  "title": "Alliance portfolio classification. Which portfolio do you have?",
  "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this article is to propose and discuss a systematic theoretical classification of alliance portfolios that allows to elucidate and develop the concept. Design/methodology/approach The study applies a conceptual approach. A review of the literature was carried out to support the conclusions of this paper. Findings The results of the classification identify three types of alliance portfolio, according to the level of management that each of them requires: additive, strategic and managed and strategic. These portfolio typologies are analyzed in an evolutionary perspective. Practical implications This article is of interest to managers as it emphasizes the management of the alliance portfolio, highlighting the elements or characteristics that determine the transition from one type of portfolio to another. Originality/value This paper contributes to the consolidation and reorientation of the extensive research into alliance portfolios and proposes a systematic classification that can help to interpret the results of research and guide future studies.",
