  "abstract": "This study assesses the performance of eight VaR models by means of the unconditional coverage and independence tests. The analysis was developed on a portfolio consisting of four stocks traded at Bucharest Stock Exchange and covered a period of five years, between October 2006 and September 2011. The results indicated that the performance of risk models is greatly affected by the characteristics of the data series used to estimate them. Also, the independence test showed that violation clustering is an actual threat for both simple and complex VaR approaches. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
