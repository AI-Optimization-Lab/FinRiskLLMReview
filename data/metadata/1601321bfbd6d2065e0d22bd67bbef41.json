  "title": "Hidden risks of construction in the third world",
  "abstract": "Today's global construction market is valued at approximately $3.25 trillion dollars, with about 25% of that total performed in the Third World. These nations, otherwise known as Lesser Developed Countries, are part of a system of classification that loosely stratifies the world into four economic tiers. The wealthiest compose the First World, Communist states are designated as the Second World; petroleum exporting countries form OPEC; and the remaining states constitute the Third World. At PricewaterhouseCoopers, we work with the participants who are engaged with construction projects around the world to help identify, monitor, assess and mitigate various kinds of project risk. These entail financial risks, contractual risks as well as country and political risks, among several others. Because we have had the fascinating opportunity to observe construction processes under an assortment of economic, cultural and political conditions, we better appreciate the numerous challenges that management teams must contend with to successfully execute their projects. This paper focuses on those special construction risks that are frequently encountered on projects located in the Third World. They encompass site safety, on-site cash reserves, coding of labor costs and activities, procurement of materials and equipment, modes of communication, travel, medical and health issues, site security, as well as language and cultural barriers. By pro-actively identifying these subtle risks and adjusting program budgets and schedules accordingly, projects in the Third World stand a far greater chance of profitable execution.",
