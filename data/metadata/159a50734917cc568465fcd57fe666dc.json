  "title": "The Impact of Special Events on Insurance Companies and Systemic Risk in Insurance Sector",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the special external shock events of insurance industry of China in 2018. The event analysis method is used to analyze the insurance companies' response to these external shock of special events. In view of the specific performances regarding to systemic risk: interconnection, contagiousness and impulse response, three methods are used respectively which are correlation test, Granger causality test and impulse function response, in order to describe the corresponding degree of systemic risk accumulation and analyze the possibility of its development into a systemic event. The results show that the insurance industry has formed a high degree of clustering, which has a significant impact on the overall financial systemic risk, and the large-scale compensation emergency has the potential to evolve into a systemic event and cause systemic risk probably.",
