  "title": "Risk Factors and Gender Differences for Depression in Chilean Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis from the National Health Survey 2016-2017",
  "abstract": "Depressive disorders are recognized as one of the most common mental health conditions across different age groups. However, the risk factors associated with depression among older people from low-and middle-income countries remains unclear. This study aims to identify socio-demographic, health and psychosocial-related factors associated with depression in Chilean older adults. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a representative sample of 1,765 adults aged >= 60 years participants from the Chilean National Health Survey 2016-2017. Depression was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF). Associations between the exposure variables and depression were investigated using Poisson regression analyses. The main findings indicated that women showed higher likelihood of depression than men (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.6 [95% CI: 1.40; 4.89]). An increased likelihood of depression was found in older adults with chronic pain, multimorbidity (>= 2 diseases), previous diagnose of depression, high perception of stress, financial stress, and difficulties for social participation. In women, higher likelihood of depression was found for those with the frailty phenotype (PR: 8.53 [95% CI: 1.68; 43.32]), rheumatoid arthritis (PR:2.41 [95% CI: 1.34; 4.34]), insomnia (PR:2.99 [95% CI: 1.74; 5.12]) and low self-rated well-being (PR:4.94 [95% CI: 2.26; 10.79]). Men who were divorced (PR:7.10 [95% CI: 1.44; 34.90]) or widowed (PR:10.83 [95% CI: 3.71; 31.58]), obese (PR:5.08 [95% CI: 1.48; 17.42) and who had asthma (PR: 7.60 [95% CI: 2.31; 24.99]) were associated with higher odds of depression. The current findings may have clinical implications for the early identification of older adults more susceptible to depression and also suggest the need to implement cultural and age-sensitive strategies to promote mental health in late life.",
