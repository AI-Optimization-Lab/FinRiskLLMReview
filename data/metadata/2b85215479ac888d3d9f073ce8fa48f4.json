  "title": "Empirical Research on Financial Risk Identification of Chinese Listed Companies Based on SOM Neural Network Model",
  "abstract": "This paper aims at applying Self-organizing Feature Map neural network algorithm on the research of Chinese listed company's financial risk identification and finally obtains good empirical results by taking 100 companies in China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2010 to 2011 as study samples. The results show that the Self-organizing Feature Map neural network algorithm is an appropriate method to identificate the financial risk of Chinese listed company. The analysis of empirical results is consistent with the actual situation.",
