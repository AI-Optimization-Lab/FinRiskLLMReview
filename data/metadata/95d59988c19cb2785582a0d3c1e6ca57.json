  "title": "Assessment of risk associated with closure and rehabilitation of dump sites",
  "abstract": "Egypt's government and civil society are addressing waste management issues, with an estimated 810,000 tons of solid waste collected annually. The government has issued warnings and initiated recycling initiatives for both legal and illegal dumpsites. This paper focuses on recent initiatives for the closure of dumpsites in megacities in Egypt. The research methodology has been developed by reviewing the most valuable international research for identification and assessment of risks that contribute to the closure and rehabilitation of open dumpsites in Egypt, as well as questionnaires and interviews with the key stakeholders involved in the closure activities. The closure phases are sorted into six classified sources of risk: site technical risks, social risks, environmental and human health factors, site rehabilitation risks (SRR), economic and financial risks (EFR), and strategic and construction partnering risks (SCPR), and 56 factors of risk. The research has found that each source classification has its own critical risks that should be considered as examples of which STR, SRR, EFR, and SCPR categories have the most critical risks. As presented in the case of Shabramant, the Giza Dumpsite Checklist. The research encourages the authorities and key stakeholders to use the risk assessment list for the closure and rehabilitation of dumpsites in Egypt.",
