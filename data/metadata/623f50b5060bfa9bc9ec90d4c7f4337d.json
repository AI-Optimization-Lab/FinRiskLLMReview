  "abstract": "Strict compliance with medication and life style modification are integral to secondary stroke prevention. This study was undertaken to find out medication adherence among stroke survivors and factors associated with it. Cross sectional survey among stroke survivors was conducted. Interview based self-reported medication adherence was defined as consumption at least >80% of their medications for last two weeks, based on last prescription. Structured interview using pretested interview schedule was done to collect other data. Sequential step wise logistic regression analysis was done to find out the facilitators and barriers to medication adherence. Two hundred and forty stroke survivors (mean age 58.64 +/- 10.96 years; 25.4% females) with a mean post-stroke period of 6.65 +/- 3.36 months were participated. Overall medication adherence was 43.8% (n = 105). Medication adherence was 34.3% (n = 134), 52.6% (n = 190) and 56.7% (n = 224) for antidiabetics, antihypertensives and statins respectively and was associated with risk factor control (Diabetes: Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.85; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.12-11.08, Hypertension: OR = 3.42; 95% CI 1.83-6.4, Dyslipidaemia: OR = 3.88; 95% CI 1.96-4.04). Having daily routine (OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.52-5.25), perceived need of medication (OR = 2.33; 95% CI 1.04-5.2) and perceived poor state of health (OR = 2.65; 95% CI 1.30-5.40) were facilitators. Memory issues (OR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.16-0.71), side effects (OR = 0.24; 95% CI 0.11-0.42) and financial constraints (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.91) were barriers to medication adherence. Establishing daily routines, periodic reminders, financial supports to buy medicines and patient education can enhance medication adherence to prevent future strokes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
