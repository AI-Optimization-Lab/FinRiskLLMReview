  "title": "Iterative nonparametric estimation of a log-optimal portfolio selection function",
  "abstract": "Let stock market vectors form a stationary ergodic sequence. For fixed d is an element of N, a log-optimal portfolio selection function of the past d observed vectors is iteratively estimated on the basis of a training sequence by use of gradients and nonparametric regression. Strong consistency is obtained under a boundedness and alpha -mixing condition without further assumptions on the distribution.",
