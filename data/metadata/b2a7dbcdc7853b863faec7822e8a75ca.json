  "title": "JF Aeroclub Airport Risk Assessment Prostejov",
  "abstract": "In recent years, the Czech Republic has developed a popularity in air transport and airlines. The reason is the classification of this type of transport as the safest. Air transport is used not only to transport people and cargo. This is a function where passenger air transport is a set of requirements for high comfort, flexibility and time savings, despite the financial demands. Thus, the demand of citizens for ordinary flying, both recreational and sport, is growing. In the Czech Republic, sport flying has a long tradition operated at airports, which are also part of aeroclubes. The article deals with the airport of the Josef Frantigek Prostejov Aeroclub and assesses possible risks at the airport. The methods set out in the Advisory Material for the development of airport contingency plans will be established for risk assessment. For these purposes simple Brainstorming, What if and partly modified CARVER methods were selected. The aim of the article is to present the results that assess the risks of a general possible threats to the Aeroclub airport.",
