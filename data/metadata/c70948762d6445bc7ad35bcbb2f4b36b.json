  "title": "Diabetes Detection Using Deep Neural Network",
  "abstract": "Diabetes is rapidly emerging worldwide issue with huge social, health and financial significances. Most of the people in the world suffer from Diabetes respective of new born child to old aged people including male and female. A diabetes patient has high blood sugar and it depend on the production of insulin in the body. Patients suffering from diabetes are treated with special diet and regular exercise. If diabetes is not controlled by the patient there is a chance of higher risk so for this a better treatment is required for this silent killer disease. Here in this paper authors have purposed Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the automatic identification of the disease. The experiment has done with the Pima Indian data set. The classification result has been presented in the result section.",
