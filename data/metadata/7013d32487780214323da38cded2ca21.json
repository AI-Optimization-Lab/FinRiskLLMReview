  "title": "Constructing early warning indicators for banks using machine learning models",
  "abstract": "This research contributes to bank liquidity risk management by employing supervised machine learning models to provide banks with early warnings of liquidity stress using market-based indicators. Identifying increasing levels of stress as early as possible provides management with a crucial window of time in which to assess and develop a potential response. This study uses publicly available data from 2007 to 2021, covering two severe stress periods: the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 crisis. The current version of the developed model then applies backtesting using the data from the COVID-19 crisis. The findings of this study show that the ensemble model with the RUSBoost algorithm predicts red and amber days with a success rate 21% greater than the average of other machine learning models; thus, it can greatly contribute to bank risk management.",
