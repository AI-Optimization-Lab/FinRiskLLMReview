  "title": "ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIO-ECOLOGICALLY STRUCTURED STRATEGIC PORTFOLIOS",
  "abstract": "The need to develop models for analyzing socio-ecologically structured strategic portfolios derives from concerns regarding the sustainable development manifested in the current economy. Such models are useful for underlying the strategy of the organizations oriented towards achieving their objectives and the requirements of sustainable development. The model that we propose is based on an algorithm of strategic portfolio classification focused on the organization's potential of sustainable development and on the sustainable demand manifested on the market, which provides logic for its application and makes it adaptable to the situations that occur in different sectors. The fact that the analysis of the strategic prescriptions is based on variables which are specific to the classical models of portfolio analysis provides the model with comparability and the transfer of strategic identity in the case of those organizations that aspire to a socio-ecological structure of their activity.",
