  "title": "Electric Power Enterprise Financial Risk Management Based On The Factor Analysis And BP Network",
  "abstract": "The comprehensive evaluation problem of electric power listed corporation has always been a focus since Market-oriented reform of the electric power industry, and financial risk evaluation play a key role to science investment decision of electric power listed corporation This paper presents a new composite forecasting method for financial risk of electric power corporation, modeling and forecasting based on Factor Analysis and Back-propagation Neural Network model. Combing reality financial data of electric power listed corporation and using Factor Analysis theory to select financial indexes, which are as modeling variables, then establishing financial risk estimation model based on Back-propagation Neural Network. Through training for the financial data, it shows that this model has a high accuracy to the results of financial risks evaluation, and it offers effective technical support to financial risk evading of electric power enterprise.",
