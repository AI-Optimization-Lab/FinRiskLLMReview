  "title": "A Hybrid GRA/MV Model for the Automatic Selection of Investment Portfolios with Minimum Risk and Maximum Return",
  "abstract": "In the proposed approach, financial data are collected automatically and are input to a GM(1,1) prediction model to forecast the future trends of the collected data. The forecast data are then reduced using a GM(1,N) model; classified using a K-Means clustering algorithm, and processed by a Rough Set (RS) classification module which selects appropriate investment stocks. Finally, a Minimum Variance At Risk (MVAR) scheme comprising five Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) models and the Markowitz means-variance (MV) model is employed to identify the efficient, frontier which achieves the optimal tradeoff between the minimum risk and the maximum rate of return.",
