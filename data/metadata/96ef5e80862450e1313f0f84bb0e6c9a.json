  "title": "Obesity is highly associated with a non-home discharge following total ankle arthroplasty",
  "abstract": "Studies have shown that non-home discharge following orthopedic procedures is associated with a higher risk of 30-day complications and significantly increases medical costs. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for being discharged to a non-home destination following total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). We included patients undergoing TAA from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (NSQIP) between 2014 and 2019. TAA was identified using CPT codes 27702, 27703 and 27704. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between discharge location (home versus non-home) and a series of exposure variables (e.g., patient demographics, patient health characteristics, and operative factors). A total of 1,704 patients were included, experiencing a 3.6% short term complication rate (61/1,704). 8.5% of the population were discharged to a non-home destination. In the final adjusted model, patients who were older [OR 1.11; 95%CI 1.08, 1.13], female [OR 2.94; 95%CI 2.04, 4.34], obese [OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.29, 2.89], had surgery in an inpatient setting [OR 5.73; 95%CI 1.78, 18.46], and ASA class IV [OR 10.65; 95%CI 1.03, 110.61] were at greater risk for a non-home discharge. People living with obesity experienced a nearly 2x greater likelihood of being discharged to a non-home destination after TAA despite their preoperative functional (e.g., ASA class) and metabolic status (i.e., diabetes). Opportunities to mitigate this risk will be needed to lessen the financial burden of TAA surgery as a growing number of obese patients become eligible for TAA in the US.",
