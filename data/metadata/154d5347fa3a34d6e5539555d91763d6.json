  "title": "Higher-order asymptotic theory of shrinkage estimation for general statistical models",
  "abstract": "In this study, we develop a higher-order asymptotic theory of shrinkage estimation for general statistical models, which includes dependent processes, multivariate models, and regression models (i.e., non-independent and identically distributed models). We introduce a shrinkage estimator of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and compare it with the standard MLE by using the third-order mean squared error. A sufficient condition for the shrinkage estimator to improve the MLE is given in a general setting. Our model is described as a curved statistical model p(-; theta(u)), where theta is a parameter of the larger model and u is a parameter of interest with dim u < dim theta. This setting is especially suitable for estimating portfolio coefficients u based on the mean and variance parameters theta. We finally provide the results of our numerical study and discuss an interesting feature of the shrinkage estimator. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.",
