  "title": "Exploration of Stock Portfolio Investment Construction Using Deep Learning Neural Network",
  "abstract": "To study the intelligent and efficient stock portfolio in China's financial market, based on the relevant theories such as deep learning (DL) neural network (NN) and stock portfolio, this study selects 111 stable stocks from the constituent stocks of the China Security Index (CSI) 300 from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, as the research samples. Then, it analyzes these research samples and imports the relevant data of 111 stocks into the DL NN model. The corresponding prediction results of stock prices are obtained. Finally, the stock portfolio model based on DL NN is compared with the data results of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 50 Index and CSI 500 Index. The results show that the closing prices of the selected 111 stocks are relatively stable and fluctuate up and down around the horizontal axis, and the positive and negative returns are relatively balanced, roughly between -5% and 5%. There is a phenomenon of fluctuation aggregation to a certain extent. Comparing the prediction results of different models reveals that the prediction results of model c are closest to the actual stock price trend. Comparing the relevant returns of the proposed stock portfolio with other stocks uncovers that the annualized return of the stock portfolio based on the DL NN model is 47.44%. The sharp ratio is 1.52, the maximum pullback is 18.15%, the monthly excess return is 3.11%, and the information ratio is 0.82. Compared with other indexes, the proposed stock portfolio shows the best results. Therefore, the proposal of the stock portfolio based on DL NN provides a theoretical basis for the development of the financial field in the future.",
