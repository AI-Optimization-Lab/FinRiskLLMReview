  "title": "Poor health literacy associated with stronger perceived barriers to breast cancer screening and overestimated breast cancer risk",
  "abstract": "BackgroundLow health literacy (HL) is negatively associated with mammography screening uptake. However, evidence of the links between poor HL and low mammography screening participation is scarce. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among participants of a cancer screening program. We measured HL using a validated Chinese instrument. We assessed breast cancer screening-related beliefs using the Health Belief Model and the accuracy of risk perception. We used multivariable regression models to estimate the relationship between HL and the outcomes. ResultsA total of 821 females were included. 264 (32.2%) had excellent or sufficient, 353 (43.0%) had problematic, and 204 (24.8%) had inadequate health literacy (IHL). Women with IHL were more likely to agree that high price (beta = -0.211, 95% CI -0.354 to -0.069), lack of time (beta = -0.219, 95% CI -0.351 to -0.088), inconvenient service time (beta = -0.291, 95% CI -0.421 to -0.160), long waiting time (beta = -0.305, 95% CI -0.447 to -0.164), fear of positive results (beta = -0.200, 95% CI -0.342 to -0.058), embarrassment (beta = -0.225, 95% CI -0.364 to -0.086), fear of pain (beta = -0.154, 95% CI -0.298 to -0.010), fear of radiation (beta = -0.177, 95% CI -0.298 to -0.056), lack of knowledge on service location (beta = -0.475, 95% CI -0.615 to -0.335), and lack of knowledge on mammography (beta = -0.360, 95% CI -0.492 to -0.228) were barriers. They were also less likely to have an accurate breast cancer risk perception (aOR 0.572, 95% CI 0.341 to 0.956). ConclusionWomen with lower HL could have stronger perceived barriers to BC screening and an over-estimation of their breast cancer risk. Tackling emotional and knowledge barriers, financial and logistical assistance, and guidance on risk perception are needed to increase their breast cancer screening uptake.",
