  "title": "An Empirical Investigation on Mobile Banking Service Adoption in Rural Karnataka",
  "abstract": "Government of India (GOI) initialized financial inclusion campaign to quell exclusion. The campaign did not gain expected progress. Government employed technologies to speed up the process. Among banking technologies, mobile banking appeared as a possible solution for financial exclusion with wide mobile phone coverage. Inputs on rural people's intention toward technologies for effective financial inclusion were essential. Technology adoption factors, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, attitude, perceived risk, and behavioral intention (BI), were short listed after literature review. Factors were subjected to reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multiple regression, and interaction analysis. Rural provinces in Karnataka state were surveyed. We used mixed sampling technique to reach 959 samples. Multiple regression-interaction analysis revealed age and gender moderated attitude's path toward BI.",
