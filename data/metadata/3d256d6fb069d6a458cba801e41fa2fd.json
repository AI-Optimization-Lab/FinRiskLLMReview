  "title": "Nonparametric Sequential Prediction While Deep Learning the Kernel",
  "abstract": "The research on online learning under stationary and ergodic processes has been mainly focused on achieving asymptotic guarantees. Although all the methods pursue the same asymptotic goal, their performance varies when handling finite sample datasets and depends heavily on which predefined density estimation method is chosen. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel algorithm that simultaneously satisfies a short-term goal, to perform as good as the best choice in hindsight of a data-adaptive kernel, learned using a deep neural network, and a long-term goal, to achieve the same theoretical asymptotic guarantee. We present theoretical proofs for our algorithms and demonstrate the validity of our method on the online portfolio selection problem.",
