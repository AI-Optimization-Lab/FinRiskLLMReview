  "title": "The Prediction of Cheating by University Students' Risk-taking Personality",
  "abstract": "The study investigated the factors that could predict cheating of 205 university students in Macao. Personal factors, such as risk-taking and academic self-concept, and contextual factor, such as perceived autonomy support from teachers, were independent variables. Different scales were applied; for example, the cheating scale, the DOSPERT scale, the academic self-concept scale, and the perceived autonomy support scale. Different regression analysis models were run, and results showed that academic self-concept, ethical, and financial risk-taking were found significant in predicting cheating, but ethical and financial risk-taking were found to have more predictive power.",
