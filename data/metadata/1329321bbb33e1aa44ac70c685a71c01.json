  "title": "Hedging effectiveness of precious metals across frequencies: Evidence from Wavelet based Dynamic Conditional Correlation analysis",
  "abstract": "This study examines the dynamic relationship between precious metals and stock markets of major developed (G7) and emerging (BRICS) nations. We use a hybrid wavelet-based Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) approach, which allows us to investigate the dynamic relationship between precious metals and stock markets in time and frequency domain. Our results suggest that DCC between the return series of precious metals and stock market varies with timescales in terms of dynamicity, persistence and strength of relationship. G7 and BRICS nations exhibit different dynamicity with precious metals over the study period (2000 to 2017). The dynamics between precious metals and G7 stock markets show similar patterns, which depicts a clustering behaviour, however, same is not true for BRICS nations. In contrast to existing literature, this study found that silver offers better hedging capability than other precious metals for both short and long-run. To construct a two-asset optimal portfolio of precious metal and stock index, palladium emerges as the most favourable option for both short and long-run. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
