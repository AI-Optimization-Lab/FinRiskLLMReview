  "title": "RAD-Seq Refines Previous Estimates of Genetic Structure in Lake Erie Walleye",
  "abstract": "Delineating population structure helps fishery managers to maintain a diverse portfolio of local spawning populations (stocks), as well as facilitate stock-specific management. In Lake Erie, commercial and recreational fisheries for Walleye Sander vitreus exploit numerous local spawning populations, which cannot be easily differentiated using traditional genetic data (e.g., microsatellites). Here, we used genomic information (12,264 polymorphic loci) generated using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to investigate stock structure in Lake Erie Walleye. We found low genetic divergence (genetic differentiation index F-ST = 0.0006-0.0019) among the four Lake Erie western basin stocks examined, which resulted in low classification accuracies for individual samples (40-60%). However, more structure existed between western and eastern Lake Erie basin stocks (F-ST = 0.0042-0.0064), resulting in greater than 95% classification accuracy of samples to a lake basin. Thus, our success in using genomics to identify stock structure varied with spatial scale. Based on our results, we offer suggestions to improve the efficacy of this new genetic tool for refining stock structure and eventually determining relative stock contributions in Lake Erie Walleye and other Great Lakes populations.",
