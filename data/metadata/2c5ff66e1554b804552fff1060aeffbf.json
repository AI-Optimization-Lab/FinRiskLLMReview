  "title": "Optimal structural synthesis, modeling, and control of micro-mechatronic systems",
  "abstract": "New advances in micro-machining, micro- and nano-scale motion structures and analog/digital ICs, provide enabling benefits and capabilities to design and manufacture micro-mechatronic systems (MMS). Critical issues are to improve power and thermal management, circuitry and actuator/sensor integration, and embedded electronically controlled microactuator/sensor assemblies. Very large-scale ICs and micromachining silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenic technologies have been developed and used to manufacture ICs and motion microstructures (actuators and sensors). While enabling technologies have been deployed, a spectrum of challenging problems remains. Micro-mechatronic systems have been widely used, and a worldwide market for MMS will be drastically increased in the near future. Analog, discrete, and hybrid MMS have been manufactured using the surface micro-machining technology (process used to fabricate ICs applying CMOS technologies). To deploy and commercialize MMS, a spectrum of problems must be solved, and a portfolio of analytical, numerical, and software design tools needs to be developed using multidisciplinary concepts. Electromagnetics and fluid dynamic, electro-thermo-mechanics and optics, biophysics and biochemistry, mechanical and structural design, analysis and optimization, simulation and virtual prototyping, among other important problems, must be thoroughly researched. There are several key focus areas studied in this paper. In particular, classification, structural synthesis and optimization, modeling and analysis, closed-loop system design and verification, as well as other long-standing problems are addressed and researched.
