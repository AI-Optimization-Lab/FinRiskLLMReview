  "title": "STOCK CHARACTERISTICS HERDED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS WITH HIGHER ABNORMAL RETURNS IN THE TAIWAN STOCK MARKET",
  "abstract": "This paper analyses the types of stocks herded by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) with higher positive abnormal returns in the emerging stock markets. Using a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model, we demonstrate that the positive price impact of the herd buying patterns of Fits in Taiwan depends on preferences for higher-turnover stocks, and larger-size stocks. Furthermore, the price impact of FIIs herd buying behavior influenced by stock characteristics is different during bullish and bearish periods. Investors in the emerging market can follow Fits and purchase stocks that the latter have overbought to improve the portfolio performance.",
