  "title": "Expert Learning through Generalized Inverse Multiobjective Optimization: Models, Insights, and Algorithms",
  "abstract": "We consider a new unsupervised learning task of inferring parameters of a multiobjective decision making model, based on a set of observed decisions from the human expert. This setting is important in applications (such as the task of portfolio management) where it may be difficult to obtain the human expert's intrinsic decision making model. We formulate such a learning problem as an inverse multiobjective optimization problem (IMOP) and propose its first sophisticated model with statistical guarantees. Then, we reveal several fundamental connections between IMOP, K-means clustering, and manifold learning. Leveraging these critical insights and connections, we propose two algorithms to solve IMOP through manifold learning and clustering. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our model and the computational efficacy of algorithms.",
