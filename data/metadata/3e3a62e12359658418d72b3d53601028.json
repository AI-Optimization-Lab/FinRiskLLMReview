  "abstract": "Research background: Big data-driven artificial Internet of Things (IoT) fintech algorithms can provide real-time personalized financial service access, strengthen risk management, and manage, monitor, and mitigate transaction operational risks by operational credit risk management, suspicious financial transaction abnormal pattern detection, and synthetic financial data-based fraud simulation. Blockchain technologies, automated financial planning and investment advice services, and risk scoring and fraud detection tools can be leveraged in financial trading forecasting and planning, cryptocurrency transactions, and financial workflow automation and fraud detection. Algorithmic trading and fraud detection tools, distributed ledger and cryptocurrency technologies, and ensemble learning and support vector machine algorithms are pivotal in predictive analytics-based risk mitigation, customer behavior and preference-based financial product and service personalization, and financial transaction and fraud detection automation. Credit scoring and risk management tools can offer financial personalized recommendations based on customer data, behavior, and preferences, in addition to transaction history, by generative adversarial and deep learning recurrent neural networks. Purpose of the article: We show that blockchain and edge computing technologies, generative artificial IoT-based fintech algorithms, and transaction monitoring and credit scoring tools can be harnessed in financial decision-making processes and loan default rate mitigation for transaction, payment, and credit process efficiency. Generative and predictive artificial intelligence (AI) algorithmic trading systems can drive coherent customer service operations, provide tailored financial and investment advice, and influence financial decision processing, while performing real-time risk assessment and financial and trading risk scenario simulation across fluctuating market conditions. Fraud and money laundering prevention tools, block- chain and financial transaction technologies, and federated and decentralized machine learning algorithms can articulate algorithmic profiling-based transaction data patterns and structures, credit assessment, loan repaying likelihood prediction, and interest rate and credit lending risk management by real-time financial pattern and economic forecast-based credit analysis across investment payment and transaction record infrastructures. Methods: Research published between 2023 and 2024 was identified and analyzed across ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases by use of screening and quality assessment software systems such as Abstrackr, AMSTAR, AXIS, CADIMA, CASP, Catchii, DistillerSR, Eppi-Reviewer, MMAT, Nested Knowledge, PICO Portal, Rayyan, ROBIS, and SRDR+. Findings & value added: The main value added derived from the systematic literature review is that generative AI-based operational risk management, fraud detection, and transaction monitoring tools can provide personalized financial support and services and clarify financial and credit decisions and operations by financial decision-making process automation in dynamic business environments based on fraud detection capabilities and transaction data analysis and assessment. The benefits for theory and current state of the art are that credit risk and financial forecasting tools, artificial IoT-based fintech and generative AI algorithms, and algorithmic trading and distributed ledger technologies can be deployed in financial decision- making and customer behavior pattern optimization, credit score assessment, and money laundering and fraudulent payment detection. Policy implications reveal that investment management and algorithmic credit scoring tools can streamline financial activity operational efficiency, design financial planning analysis and forecasting, and carry out financial service and transaction data analysis for informed transaction decision-making and fraudulent behavior pattern and incident detection, taking into account credit history and risk evaluation and improving personalized experiences.",
