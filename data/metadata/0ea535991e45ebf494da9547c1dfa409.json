  "title": "Radical prostatectomy readmissions: Causes, risk factors, national rates, & costs",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Readmissions have substantial clinical and financial impacts on the healthcare system. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is considered a standard treatment in the management of clinically localized prostate cancer. Yet, there is a paucity of research evaluating readmissions for RP in a national dataset. Patients and methods: Patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer managed with RP were identified within the 2016 to 2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patient factors, facility factors, and surgical characteristics were evaluated for associations with read-mission using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 133,727 patients receiving RP were identified. Early (30-day) and late (31- 90-day) readmission rates were 4.2% and 1.8% respectively. The most common cause of early readmission was postoperative digestive system complication (10%) and the most common cause of late readmission was septicemia (13%). On multivariable logistic regression, factors associated with both early and late readmission include nonroutine discharge at index (early: OR 1.877, 95% CI 1.667-2.113; late: OR 1.801, 95% CI 1.490-2.183), and circulatory system comorbidity (early: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.082-1.538); late: OR 1.515, 95% CI 1.157-1.984). Conclusions: Our findings regarding factors associated with readmission provide insight for RP counseling and may inform postoperative care pathways. Elucidation of readmission trends may allow the identification and proactive management of patients at higher risk for readmission. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
