  "title": "RETRACTED: Research on Enterprise Financial Management and Prediction System Based on SaaS Model (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "In order to supervise and forewarn the sustainable operation ability of enterprises efficiently and accurately, this paper proposes an enterprise financial management and forecasting system based on SaaS model. First of all, in order to continue to effectively predict and analyze the enterprise finance, first analyze and extract the report data in the financial system. Then, by building a deep belief network model to predict the enterprise financial data, in order to reduce the cost of enterprises, the financial system designed in this paper chooses the cloud technology service framework based on SaaS model. Finally, in order to analyze the risk identification performance of the financial management and prediction system in this paper, the risk sample data of an enterprise's financial system is selected for simulation test. The results show that the correct rate of risk identification of the financial management system designed in this paper is higher than other comparison systems, which speeds up the speed of risk identification of the financial information management system, and has certain practical application value.",
