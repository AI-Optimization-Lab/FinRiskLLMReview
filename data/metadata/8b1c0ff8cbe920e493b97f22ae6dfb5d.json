  "title": "RETRACTED: Analysis of Option Butterfly Portfolio Models Based on Nonparametric Estimation Deep Learning Method (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "The option butterfly portfolio is the commonly option arbitrage strategy. In reality, because the distribution of the option state price density (SPD) function is not normal and unknown, so the nonparametric deep learning methods to estimate option butterfly portfolio returns are proposed. This paper constructs the single-index nonparametric option pricing model which contains multiple influencing factors and presents the nonparametric estimation form for option butterfly portfolio returns. The empirical analysis shows that the SPD function estimated by using single-index nonparametric option model can effectively calculate the option butterfly portfolio returns with the minimum option strike price interval and provide an effective reference tool for risk-averse investors with limited risk preferences.",
