  "title": "Building contextual classifiers by integrating fuzzy rule based classification technique and k-nn method for credit scoring",
  "abstract": "Credit-risk evaluation is a very challenging and important problem in the domain of financial analysis. Many classification methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle this problem. Statistical and neural network based approaches are among the most popular paradigms. However, most of these methods produce so-called hard classifiers, those generate decisions without any accompanying confidence measure. In contrast, soft classifiers, such as those designed using fuzzy set theoretic approach; produce a measure of support for the decision (and also alternative decisions) that provides the analyst with greater insight. In this paper, we propose a method of building credit-scoring models using fuzzy rule based classifiers. First, the rule base is learned from the training data using a SOM based method. Then the fuzzy k-nn rule is incorporated with it to design a contextual classifier that integrates the context information from the training set for more robust and qualitatively better classification. Further, a method of seamlessly integrating business constraints into the model is also demonstrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
