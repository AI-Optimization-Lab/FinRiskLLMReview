  "title": "What Factors Affect the Intention to Borrow Through Peer to Peer Lending in Indonesia?",
  "abstract": "This research aims to investigate various intentions that influence borrowers in using a technology that focuses on the peer to peer lending platform as a growing financial services business in Indonesia. We use a survey by distributing online questionnaires and collect data from 183 borrower through peer to peer lending. The linear regression results that have been done show that trust, perceived risk, utilitarian value, and perceived cost have a significant effect on intention to borrow through peer to peer lending whereas ease of use shows insignificant results. The limitations of this study emphasize the first ten peer to peer lending companies registered with the OJK. Also, this study consisted of five factors measured against intention to borrow through peer to peer lending.",
