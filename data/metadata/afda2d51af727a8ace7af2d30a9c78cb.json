  "title": "Deterministic economic analysis of feedlot Red Angus young steers: slaughter weights and bonus",
  "abstract": "The joint analysis of indicators of the investment project is very relevant in making decisions, resulting in more consistent information regarding risk assessment and its confrontation with the possibility of return. This research aimed to evaluate the economic feasibility of Red Angus young steers finished in feedlot, slaughtered at 340, 373, 396 or 430kg with use of various financial indicators, marketed with or without bonus. The purchase of feeder cattle and feeding were variable costs with a higher share in the total cost. In the analysis with bonus, the regression analysis to gross margin, net margin, net present value, benefit: cost index and additional return on investment showed quadratic behavior, with the point of maximum at 406kg (R$ 185.17), 406kg (R$ 161.76), 393kg (R$ 128.29), 392kg (1.12), 392kg (11.98%), respectively. In the analysis without bonus, gross margin and net margin showed a quadratic response (346kg, with R$ 110.31 and R$ 86.90, respectively), while for the other indicators, there was a linear reduction as an increase in slaughter weight.",
