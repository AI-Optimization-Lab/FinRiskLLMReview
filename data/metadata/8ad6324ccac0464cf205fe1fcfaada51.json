  "abstract": "PurposePatients with Germ cell tumours (GCT) are at risk of long-term toxicities due to multimodality therapy. It is debatable whether there is an impact on the quality of life(QoL) of GCT survivors.MethodsA case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in India, using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire, to compare the QoL between GCT survivors(disease free > 2 years) and healthy matched controls. A multivariate regression model was used to identify factors affecting QoL.ResultsA total of 55 cases and 100 controls were recruited. Cases had a median age of 32 years (interquartile range, IQR 28-40 years), ECOG PS of 0-1(75%), advanced stage III (58%), chemotherapy (94%) and 66% were > 5 years from diagnosis. The median age of controls: 35 years (IQR 28-43 years). A statistically significant difference was seen for emotional (85.8 & PLUSMN; 14.2 vs 91.7 & PLUSMN; 10.4, p 0.005), social(83.0 & PLUSMN; 22.0 vs 95.2 & PLUSMN; 9.6, p < 0.001) and global scales (80.4 & PLUSMN; 21.1 vs 91.3 & PLUSMN; 9.7, p < 0.001). Cases had more nausea and vomiting(3.3 & PLUSMN; 7.4 vs 1.0 & PLUSMN; 3.9, p 0.015), pain(13.9 & PLUSMN; 13.9 vs 4.8 & PLUSMN; 9.8, p < 0.001), dyspnea(7.9 + 14.3 vs 2.7 & PLUSMN; 9.1, p 0.007), and appetite loss(6.7 & PLUSMN; 14.9 vs 1.9 & PLUSMN; 7.9, p 0.016) and greater financial toxicity(31.5 & PLUSMN; 32.3 vs 9.0 & PLUSMN; 16.3, p < 0.001). Adjusting for age, performance status, BMI, stage, chemotherapy, RPLND, recurrent disease, and time since diagnosis, no predictive variables were significant.ConclusionThere is a detrimental impact of history of GCT in long term survivors of GCT.",
