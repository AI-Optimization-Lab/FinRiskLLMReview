  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of chronic pain on functionality and its consequences on work and patient income.METHODS: A total of 103 patients from the Multidisciplinary Pain Center of the Clinics Hospital of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais were interviewed between January 2020 and June 2021, applying questionnaires on mobile devices. Socioeconomic data, multidimensional characterization of pain, and instruments for assessing pain functionality and intensity were analyzed. Pain intensity was categorized as mild, moderate, or intense for comparative analysis. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and variables that jointly influence the outcome of pain intensity.RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 55 years, were predominantly female, married or in a stable relationship, white race, and completed high school. The median family income was R$2,200. Most patients were retired due to disability and pain-related causes. Functionality analysis showed severe disability directly associated with pain intensity. The financial impacts observed were correlated with the pain intensity of the patients. Age was a risk factor for pain intensity, while sex, family income, and duration of pain served as protective factors.CONCLUSION: Chronic pain was associated with severe disability, decreased productivity, and exit from the labor market, with a negative impact on financial condition. Age, sex, family income, and duration of pain were directly associated with pain intensity.",
