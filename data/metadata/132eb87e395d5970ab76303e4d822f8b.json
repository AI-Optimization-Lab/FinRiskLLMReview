  "title": "INFORMATION MODEL OF E-PORTFOLIO",
  "abstract": "The e-portfolio is an important structured information resource reflecting the competence of the student acquired at different stages of learning (pre-school, general education, college, university, further education) and practical activities. The information contained in the e-portfolio is important for the student, the educational organization and the employer. For the effective use e-portfolio should include a unified reference framework, competency model, personal data, etc. In the article is contributed the conceptual approach and the information model of the electronic portfolio of the student, taking into account the fundamental requirements of international standards and national specifics of the Russian education. There was developed a high-level conceptual model of e-portfolio, which can be the interface between the three main stakeholders: the student, the educational institution and employer. It determines the content and functional components that support e-portfolio systems and solve problems of data interoperability between these components. The key characteristics of e-portfolio, their classification by purpose, functionality and target audience were considered. The information base structure, reflecting levels of education, competence, labor function, qualification thesis and other information about the student was submitted. For a software implementation was designed a logical database model.",
