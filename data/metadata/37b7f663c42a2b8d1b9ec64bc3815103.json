  "title": "An Institutional Academic and Research Track Curriculum for Radiology Residents: Development, Implementation, and Outcomes Assessment at 6 Years",
  "abstract": "Rationale and Objectives: We report the creation of a voluntary research development curriculum for radiology residents at our institution, detailing outcomes after 6 years of existence. Materials and Methods: We developed a comprehensive Academic and Research Track (ART) curriculum for radiology residents in our department, including mentorship, monthly meetings, didactic curriculum, ongoing evaluation/feedback, protected academic time, and financial support. A literature review identified all indexed publications for our residency graduates from 6 years pre(2007-2012) to 6 years post-ART (2013-2018) intervention. We also documented career outcomes (academic versus private practice). Summary statistics, Chi-square, and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: ART group demonstrated significantly greater publication likelihood versus pre-ART predecessors (odds ratio [OR]: 3.59, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.40-9.19; risk ratios [RR]: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.19-2.11; p= 0.01), contemporaneous non-ART cohort (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.12-8.33; RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.96; p = 0.04), and combined pre-ART plus non-ART group (OR: 3.34, 95% CI: 1.35-8.22; RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.87-2.29; p = 0.012). In Poisson regression, ART was a significant factor for total, first author, and senior author publications among all graduates and among the subset which remained in academics (all p -values < 0.05). Estimators were positive in all regressions, indicating a positive effect of ART for increasing numbers of publications. Conclusion: ART membership was associated with significantly increased indexed publications. A greater proportion of ART members remained in academics compared to non-ART members, but did not reach statistical significance. We detail our ART structure and curriculum, which may be used as a malleable template for other radiology departments.",
