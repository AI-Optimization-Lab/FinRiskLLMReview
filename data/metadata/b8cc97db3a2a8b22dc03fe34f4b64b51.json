  "title": "THE IMPACT OF IFRS ON EARNING SMOOTHING AND DISCRETIONARY ACCRUALS ON THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY OF INDIA",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The study investigates the impact ofIFRS on India's listed automobile companies with the assistance ofdiscretionary accruals and earnings smoothing.Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data from 59 automobile companies listed in BSE and NSE spanning over ten years from 2010 to 2020, Pre and post-IFRS impact has been analysed by applying a t-test. Correlation is used to check the association among variables. Further, panel regression is applied to observe the combined impact of all the variables of the companies' understudy with E -views' help.Findings: The findings deduced from the empirical results that the applied analysis catalyses the reality of adopting IFRS in India as a decisive factor in improving the majority ofautomobile industries' financialstatements. The results further supported IFRS with a significant positive effect on most variables selected for comparison. Meanwhile, the research output of the study is helpful for the aut omobile companies' managers, portfolio investors, and policymakers.Originality/value: The study is among the earlier attempts to examine the association between IFRS on India's listed automobile companies with the assistance of discretionary accruals and earnings smoothing",
