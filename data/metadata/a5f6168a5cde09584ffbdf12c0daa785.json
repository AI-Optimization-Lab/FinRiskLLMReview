  "title": "Anxiety trajectories from pregnancy to one-year postpartum and their contributors during the COVID-19 pandemic",
  "abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety in the peripartum period (pregnancy through one-year postpartum) has negative impacts on mothers and infants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high rates of anxiety were reported worldwide, but trajectories for how these symptoms change longitudinally in the peripartum period remain unknown.MethodsA total of 1,411 women who were pregnant during the second U.S. COVID-19 surge completed four study questionnaires between December 2020 and March 2022, including assessments of anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) and individual and community-level contributors. Latent Class Growth Mixture Models (LCGMM) were used to identify anxiety trajectories, and multinomial logistic regression was used to identify contributors to class membership.ResultsThree classes of anxiety symptom trajectories were identified. Class 1 (n = 956, 67.8%) experienced minimal/mild anxiety throughout the peripartum period. Class 2 (n = 362, 25.7%) experienced initial moderate anxiety that remained stable. Class 3 (n = 93, 6.6%) experienced initial moderate anxiety that increased to severe in the postpartum period. Stress and history of mental health diagnosis contributed to higher initial levels of anxiety and ongoing social support contributed to lower levels of anxiety. In addition, financial insecurity increased the risk of belonging to Class 3.ConclusionsScreening for anxiety symptoms and psychosocial vulnerabilities in the peripartum period is vital, as is early intervention. This is especially the case among women with limited financial and social resources who may experience chronic or worsening anxiety as they transition to parenthood.",
