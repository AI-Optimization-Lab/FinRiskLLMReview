  "title": "Research on Demand Side Resources Planning Strategy of Load Aggregator Considering CVaR",
  "abstract": "With the rapid development of demand response (DR) technology, the construction of load aggregator (LA) has gradually received attention. In this paper, the bilateral uncertainties faced by LAs is considered to solve the investment planning problem of new LAs. The K-means clustering method is used to process historical electricity price data and analyze the uncertainties of DR signals. Based on the portfolio theory and CVaR model, the demand side resources (DSRs) optimization configuration model of the LA is established. The example analyzes the DSRs planning results of LAs under different risk preferences, and emphasizes the role of energy storage devices in stabilizing risks.",
