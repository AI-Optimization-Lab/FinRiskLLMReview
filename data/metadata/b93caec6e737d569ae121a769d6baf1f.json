  "title": "Food insecurity is associated with lower diet quality among dental students",
  "abstract": "PurposeFood insecurity is associated with lower diet quality, adverse health outcomes, and academic difficulty among undergraduate students. The objective was to identify the relationship between food security status and diet quality in dental students. MethodsAll dental students attending Howard University (n = 286) or the University of Iowa (n = 326) during the fall 2021 semester were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey designed to query demographics, food security status (i.e., United States Department of Agriculture's ten item Adult Food Security Module), and diet quality (i.e., short Healthy Eating Index). The survey was administered using the Qualtrics platform. ResultsResponse rates were similar for Howard (32.5%) and Iowa (29.4%). Students with food insecurity (46.0%) were slightly older and more likely to be Black or other, first generation professional/graduate students, and receive financial aid than peers with food security (p < 0.050). Food insecurity was associated with lower intakes of fruits and vegetables (p & LE; 0.005), higher intakes of added sugars (p < 0.001), and lower diet quality (p = 0.003). In linear regression analyses that controlled for other variables, food insecurity (p = 0.012), school site (p = 0.027), and gender (p = 0.039) were predictive of lower diet quality. ConclusionsThe inability to procure adequate and appropriate foods was associated with marginal dietary habits (i.e., less than ideal food choices and eating behaviors) and lower diet quality in dental students. Both marginal dietary habits and lower diet quality increase chronic disease risk and may present a barrier to academic success. Addressing food insecurity among dental students is necessary to ensure equitable opportunities for a healthy workforce in the future.",
