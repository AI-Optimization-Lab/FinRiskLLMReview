  "abstract": "Objectives: To explore the prevalence and risk factors associated with circadian syndrome (CricS) in communitydwelling middle-aged to older adults. Method: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 13,516 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). We used logistic regression to compute the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (Cls), using covariates derived through the health ecology model. Results: The overall prevalence of CricS was 31.5 % (25.0 % males and 37.1 % females). With controlling all covariates, social isolation (OR 1.164, 95%CI 1.033-1.310), irritable mood (OR 1.689, 95%CI 1.488-1.917), fear responses (OR 1.546, 95%CI 1.262-1.894), chronic disease (OR 1.577, 95%CI 1.392-1.788), and financial debt (OR 0.806, 95%CI 0.657-0.990) were significantly correlated with increased CricS risk in males, whereas CricS syndrome was significantly associated with age (OR 1.285, 95%CI 1.214-1.361), married (OR 1.258, 95%CI 1.089-1.452), current drinkers (OR 0.835, 95%CI 0.716-0.974), social isolation (OR 1.175, 95%CI 1.065-1.296), irritable mood (OR 1.346, 95%CI 1.210-1.497), fear responses (OR 1.202, 95%CI 1.047-1.378), chronic disease (OR 1.363, 95%CI 1.225-1.517), chronic pain (OR 1.177, 95%CI 1.058-1.309), and universal basic income (OR 0.742, 95%CI 0.611-0.900) in females. Conclusion: CricS is common in middle-aged to older adults, and health behavior factors have an important impact on CricS. The potential predictors identified for CricS should be further studied to prevent the occurrence of adverse health events in the presenium stage.",
