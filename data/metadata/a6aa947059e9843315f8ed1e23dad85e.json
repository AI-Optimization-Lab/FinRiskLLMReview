  "title": "Restructuring Measurements Impact on Bank Risk After the Global Financial Crisis - Empirical Evidence from Vietnam",
  "abstract": "Project 254 signed in November 2011 which is relating to Restructuring the system of credit institutions in the period of 2011-2015 has been considered as a milestone in marking the Vietnamese government to prevent the influence of the financial crisis of 2008. This paper identifies hypotheses evaluating the impact of restructuring measurements on the risk of the Vietnamese's commercial banks in 10 years, starting from 2008. Using the OLS regression method for analysis by running Eviews and ANOVA test in SPSS with a unique database of 216 observations of 31 commercial banks in Vietnam, it was found that: (i) The bail-out activities of the State Bank of Vietnam in 2015 does not influence on bank risk, (ii) The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) do not support the bank to reduce risk, it increases the risk for acquiring banks, (iii) The global crisis 2008 exerts dire consequence on the bank system in Vietnam, (iv) There is the difference of risk among the groups of the bank experiencing a different number of years of operation. Basing on this result, the paper also makes recommendations to the Government, The State Bank of Vietnam and the commercial banks for effective risk management toward the development of the Vietnamese banking system.",
