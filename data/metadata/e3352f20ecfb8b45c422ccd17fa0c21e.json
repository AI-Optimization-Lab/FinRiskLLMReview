  "title": "Abnormal behavior identification of enterprise cloud platform financial system based on artificial neural network",
  "abstract": "This paper presents an effective and accurate method to analyze the network traffic risk of enterprise public cloud financial system by using deep learning algorithm. To build the analytical model, the collected data is preprocessed to extract relevant features that contribute to risk analysis. The pre-processed data is used to train the deep learning model. The model is designed to learn patterns and relationships in network traffic data. The network traffic risk analysis module is constructed by combining the deep learning model with the system architecture of the enterprise public cloud financial system. Through a trained deep learning model, the module is able to accurately identify abnormal behavior in network traffic and provide corresponding risk assessments. The results show that the proposed system module can accurately identify abnormal behavior in network traffic and provide risk assessment.",
