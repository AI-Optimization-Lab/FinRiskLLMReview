  "title": "Financial Market Prediction Using Feed Forward Neural Network",
  "abstract": "This paper outlines a methodology for aiding the decision making process for investment between two financial market assets (eg a risky asset versus a risk-free asset or between two risky assets itself), using neural network architecture. A Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network has been evaluated. The model is employed for arriving at a decision as to where to invest in the next time step. given data from the current time step. The time step could be chosen on daily/weekly/monthly basis, based on the investment requirement. In this study, the FFNN has yielded good results over RBF. Consequently two such FFNN have been developed to enable us make a decision on investment in the next time step to decide between two risky assets. The prediction made by the two FFNN models has been validated from the actual market data.",
