  "title": "Algorithm for cardinality-constrained quadratic optimization",
  "abstract": "This paper describes an algorithm for cardinality-constrained quadratic optimization problems, which are convex quadratic programming problems with a limit on the number of non-zeros in the optimal solution. In particular, we consider problems of subset selection in regression and portfolio selection in asset management and propose branch-and-bound based algorithms that take advantage of the special structure of these problems. We compare our tailored methods against CPLEX's quadratic mixed-integer solver and conclude that the proposed algorithms have practical advantages for the special class of problems we consider.",
