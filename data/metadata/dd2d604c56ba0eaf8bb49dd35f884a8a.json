  "title": "Systematic Development of a Machine Learning-Based Asset Management Tool for Wastewater Pipeline Networks",
  "abstract": "Utility companies face significant challenges in managing wastewater distribution networks (WWDN), where continuous service delivery is crucial. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) rated the U.S. wastewater treatment infrastructure as inadequate, assigning it a D+ grade due to its high risk of failure. Such failures can lead to severe economic and environmental damage, with untreated waste contaminating ecosystems and causing costly cleanups. Traditionally, the industry has relied on reactive, subjective asset management, addressing issues only after failures occur. This reactive approach often results in unexpected expenses and strains operational budgets. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive, data-driven asset management framework for the wastewater industry. Our strategy aims to reduce unforeseen costs by minimizing the likelihood of asset failure, environmental risks, and financial losses. By leveraging machine learning, specifically random forest classification, and analyzing historical data, we developed a predictive tool in Python. This tool identifies high-risk assets, enabling prioritized maintenance actions, ultimately mitigating potential environmental impacts and associated costs.",
