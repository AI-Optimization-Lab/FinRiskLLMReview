  "abstract": "Purpose. The purpose of this article is to identify and and systematize organizational and economic risks that may arise during the ecologization of production processes in the agricultural sector, as well as to summarize the main stages of 'risk management' of agricultural greening and justify the the necessary tools to reduce their likelihood. Methodology/approach. The methodological bases of the work are general scientific and specific methods of economic theory as well as a systematic approach to the study of economic phenomena. The paper uses an abstract-logical method - for the logical formation of the main aspects and conclusions of the study; the method of questionnaire survey to determine the types of risk from the implementation of elements of ecologization and the method of expert assessments in order to establish the average weight of risks of ecologization of agriculture. Results. Approaches to determining the natures of risks are generalized and the definition of risks of ecologization of the agricultural sector of the economy are formulated. There was held the typification of the main types of organizational and economic risk, which may occur during the ecologization of production processes in the industry on the basis of the questionnaire method. The use of the method of expert assessments made it possible to assess the weight (importance) of identified risks. The main tools for reducing the risks of ecologization of agriculture at the level of enterprises and the state are proposed. Originality/scientific novelty. The methodological approach to monitoring the risks of ecologization of agriculture has been improved and their definition has been formulated; further developed the classification of risks of ecologization of agriculture, which were grouped into four groups: financial and economic, production risks, logistics and institutional risks; the degrees of their importance in this process were determined and the main tools for reducing the risk of ecologization at the enterprise and state level were standardized. Practical value/implications. The results of the study allow a more comprehensive assessment of the risks of ecologization of the agricultural sector, to form priority areas for their management and to summarize the main tools for reducing the risk of ecologization at the enterprise level and at the state level.",
