  "title": "Effect of birthplace on cardiometabolic risk among blacks in the Metabolic Syndrome Outcome Study (MetSO)",
  "abstract": "Background: Metabolic syndrome poses an increased global burden of disease and causes immense financial burden, warranting heightened public health attention. The present study assessed the prevalence and severity of cardiometabolic risk among foreign-born versus US-born blacks, while exploring potential gender-based effects. Methods: A total of 1035 patients from the Metabolic Syndrome Outcome Study (Trial registration: NCT01946659) provided sociodemographic, medical history, and clinical data. General Linear Model (GLM) was used to assess the effects of birthplace and gender on cardiometabolic parameters, adjusting for age differences in the sample. Results: Of the sample, 61.6 % were foreign-born blacks (FBB) and 38.4 % were US-born blacks (USB). FBB had significantly lower BMI compared with USB (32.76 +/- 0.35 vs. 35.41 +/- 0.44, F = 22.57), but had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (136.70 +/- 0.77 vs. 132.83 +/- 0.98; F = 9.60) and fasting glucose levels than did USB (146.46 +/- 3.37 vs. 135.02 +/- 4.27; F = 4.40). Men had higher diastolic BP (76.67 +/- 0.65 vs. 75.05 +/- 0.45; F = 4.20), glucose (146.53 +/- 4.48 vs. 134.95 +/- 3.07; F = 4.55) and triglyceride levels (148.10 +/- 4.51 vs. 130.60 +/- 3.09; F = 10.25) compared with women, but women had higher LDL-cholesterol (109.24 +/- 1.49 vs. 98.49 +/- 2.18; F = 16.60) and HDL-cholesterol levels (50.71 +/- 0.66 vs. 42.77 +/- 0.97; F = 46.01) than did men. Conclusions: Results showed that birthplace has a significant influence on cardiometabolic profiles of blacks with metabolic syndrome. Patients' gender also had an independent influence on cardiometabolic profile.",
