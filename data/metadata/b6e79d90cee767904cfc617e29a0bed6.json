  "title": "Application of Cluster Analysis in Stock Selection in United States Stock Market",
  "abstract": "Quantitative trading plays a significant role in stock selection due to its great flexibility and operability. A stock selection strategy was introduced based on the K-means clustering model in machine learning. Some technical indicators, such as MA, KDJ, and MACD with short and long periods, were taken into consideration in our strategy. The United States market stocks were divided into several clusters. And stocks close to the center of the best cluster were chosen to construct a portfolio. Experimental results showed that the investment strategy has a higher excess return rate during the bull market and decreases synchronously with the market trend during the bear market. This strategy, however, is superior to the performance of the S&P500 index at any time. This paper proposes a feasible strategy, which could get a considerable rate of return, to solve the problem of US stock selection.",
