  "title": "Locational Strategy of Professional Hosts: Effect on Perceived Quality and Revenue Performance of Airbnb Listings",
  "abstract": "Professional hosts usually invest in properties at various locations. Our study aims to investigate the effect of their locational strategy (clustering vs. diversification) on the perceived quality and revenue performance of each listing in their portfolio. Using data of Airbnb in New York City, we find that locational clustering drives the perceived quality but undermines the revenue performance of each listing, and these effects are further moderated by the size of the listing portfolio managed by a professional host. Implications for Airbnb investment using effective locational strategy are provided.",
