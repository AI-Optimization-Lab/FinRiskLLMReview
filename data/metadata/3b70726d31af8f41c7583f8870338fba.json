  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinically risk-adjusted financial model to estimate the cost associated with a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy programme. METHODS: Prospectively collected data of 236 VATS lobectomy patients (August 2012-December 2013) were analysed retrospectively. Fixed and variable intraoperative and postoperative costs were retrieved from the Hospital Accounting Department. Baseline and surgical variables were tested for a possible association with total cost using a multivariable linear regression and bootstrap analyses. Costs were calculated in GBP and expressed in Euros (EUR: GBP exchange rate 1.4). RESULTS: The average total cost of a VATS lobectomy was (sic)11 368 (range (sic)6992-(sic)62 535). Average intraoperative (including surgical and anaesthetic time, overhead, disposable materials) and postoperative costs [including ward stay, high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU) and variable costs associated with management of complications] were (sic)8226 (range (sic)5656-(sic)13 296) and (sic)3029 (range (sic)529-(sic)51 970), respectively. The following variables remained reliably associated with total costs after linear regression analysis and bootstrap: carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) < 60% predicted value (P = 0.02, bootstrap 63%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; P = 0.035, bootstrap 57%). The following model was developed to estimate the total costs: 10 523 + 1894 x COPD + 2376 x DLCO < 60%. The comparison between predicted and observed costs was repeated in 1000 bootstrapped samples to verify the stability of the model. The two values were not different (P > 0.05) in 86% of the samples. A hypothetical patient with COPD and DLCO less than 60% would cost (sic)4270 more than a patient without COPD and with higher DLCO values ((sic)14 793 vs (sic)10 523). CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adjusting financial data can help estimate the total cost associated with VATS lobectomy based on clinical factors. This model can be used to audit the internal financial performance of a VATS lobectomy programme for budgeting, planning and for appropriate bundled payment reimbursements.",
