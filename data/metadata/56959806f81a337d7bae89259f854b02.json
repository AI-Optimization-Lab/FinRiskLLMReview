  "title": "Title: Perceived familial financial insecurity and obesity among Korean adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic",
  "abstract": "Background: In high -income countries, socioeconomically disadvantaged adolescents experience a higher risk of obesity, which may have been further exacerbated during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the association between obesity and familial financial insecurity, utilizing data on subjective household socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived family -level financial deterioration induced by COVID-19. Methods: We utilized data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents, in 2020 and 2021. The independent and joint associations of two primary exposures, subjective household SES and perceived family -level financial deterioration, with obesity were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Among 106,979 adolescents aged 12-18 years, 16.9% of boys and 9.0% of girls met the criteria for obesity. Notably, 70.5% reported experiencing COVID-19-related financial deterioration. Both subjective household SES and perceived family -level financial deterioration independently and synergistically increased the odds of obesity. A graded association was observed between obesity and lower SES and more severe financial deterioration, particularly among girls. Younger adolescents were more sensitive to household SES, whereas older adolescents were more sensitive to financial deterioration. Conclusions: While the COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique social context, our findings highlight that financially insecure adolescents were at an increased risk of obesity during the early phase of the pandemic. This underscores the need for obesity -prevention strategies in times of macroeconomic recession to address not only the persistent influence of household SES but also the direct and indirect effects of family -level financial deterioration.",
