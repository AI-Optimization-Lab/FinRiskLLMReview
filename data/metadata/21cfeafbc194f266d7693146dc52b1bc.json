  "title": "Facilitating User Authorization from Imbalanced Data Logs of Credit Cards Using Artificial Intelligence",
  "abstract": "An effective machine learning implementation means that artificial intelligence has tremendous potential to help and automate financial threat assessment for commercial firms and credit agencies. The scope of this study is to build a predictive framework to help the credit bureau by modelling/assessing the credit card delinquency risk. Machine learning enables risk assessment by predicting deception in large imbalanced data by classifying the transaction as normal or fraudster. In case of fraud transaction, an alert can be sent to the related financial organization that can suspend the release of payment for particular transaction. Of all the machine learning models such as RUSBoost, decision tree, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine, the overall predictive performance of customized RUSBoost is the most impressive. The evaluation metrics used in the experimentation are sensitivity, specificity, precision, F scores, and area under receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves. Datasets used for training and testing of the models have been taken from kaggle.com.",
