  "title": "Trend representation based log-density regularization system for portfolio optimization",
  "abstract": "Portfolio optimization (PO) has been catching more and more attention in the artificial intelligence and the machine learning communities. In this paper, we propose a novel Trend Representation based Log density Regularization (TRLR) system for portfolio optimization. Its novelty falls into two aspects. First, it introduces a log-density regularization to the increasing factor of portfolio, which is seldom addressed by previous PO systems. It reflects a relationship between the portfolio and the price relative at an equilibrium point. Second, TRLR exploits a novel trend representation by taking the time variable as regressor in a weighted ridge regression, hence TRLR captures price trend patterns effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets from real-world financial markets demonstrate that TRLR achieves significantly better performance than other state-of-the-art strategies and runs fast, which shows its effectiveness and efficiency for large-scale applications.
