  "title": "Investigating the burden of mental distress among nurses at a provincial COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study",
  "abstract": "Background The current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has distorted the physical, mental, and psychological condition of frontline healthcare providers in health facilities. This study aims to investigate the prevalence, and risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses working in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 491 nurses, aged between 31, and 56 years, using a self-administered questionnaire. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), and demographic questions were used to screen the presence of psychological problems, and their associated factors. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress was 8.5 %, 20.6 and 6.3 %, respectively. Regression analysis showed that anxiety was significantly higher among nurses working in non-COVID wards (p = .01), those who experienced social rejection (p < .05), and those who frequently watched television (p < .05). Those who had temporary contracts were more stressed (p < .05), and those who faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly experienced depression, anxiety, and stress at 10.5 %, 23.5 %, and 8.1 % respectively(p < .05). Conclusions While the prevalence of mental distress in this hospital is low, it exists, and hospital management should consider training for all nurses, public sensitization on COVID-19, and provision of financial subsidies for frontline workers, in order to manage the risk factors.",
