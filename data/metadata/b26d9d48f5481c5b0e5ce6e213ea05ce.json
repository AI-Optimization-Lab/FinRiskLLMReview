  "title": "Optimization of Agricultural Land Use on the Basis of Mathematical Methods of Financial Analysis and the Theory of Fuzzy Sets",
  "abstract": "The article presents the optimization model of unsustainable land use on the basis of data on crop acreage and yield for major agricultural crops grown in the Rostov region. The following mathematical apparatus used for modeling: methods of regression analysis and nonlinear optimization, commonly used in the mathematical methods of financial analysis to optimize portfolios of financial instruments. The model allows to calculate the optimal quantitative distribution of territories that ensures the maximum average yield with minimal average risk. Model modified on the basis of fuzzy set theory to apply in practical calculations, the overall estimated harvest of crop species.",
