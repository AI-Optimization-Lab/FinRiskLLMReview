  "title": "Provincial Maternal Mortality Surveillance Systems in China",
  "abstract": "Background. Provincial maternal mortality surveillance systems (PMMSS) have been set up in nearly all the provinces in China to monitor local maternal mortality and provide the evidence for maternal health interventions suited to local conditions. However, till now little is known outside of China about the characteristics of PMMSS. Methods. A systematic review of the literature contained in PubMed and China Academic Journal Network Publishing database was carried out. The current situation on PMMSS was described. Provincial disparities on PMMR in six provinces were analyzed by Poisson regression analysis. Results. A total of 35 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 31 were published in Chinese. PMMSS were set up and adjusted by the provincial government based on their own financial resources and demand. Provinces from remote region had the highest risk of maternal mortality, followed by provinces from inland region and coast region. Conclusions. PMMSS may be the most reliable data source for measuring provincial level MMR in each province. Great provincial disparities on PMMSS and PMMR do exist within the country; more emphasis should be placed on improving PMMSS and reducing PMMR particularly in the provinces with high maternal death burden.",
