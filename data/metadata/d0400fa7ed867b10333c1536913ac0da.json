  "title": "Psychosocial Factors Related to Smoking: The Midlife Study",
  "abstract": "Background: There is limited research on the correlates of cigarette smoking in women in late midlife. Objectives: The present study examined the associations between risk factors in several psychosocial domains and current cigarette smoking among women in their mid-60s. These domains included risks in personal attributes, family relationships, negative life events, financial stressors, contextual factors, and problematic alcohol use. Methods: Data were from a cohort of women originally living in two upstate New York counties (N = 511) in late midlife (mean age 65). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The results supported our hypotheses. The cumulative psychosocial risk index was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of cigarette smoking [A.O.R. = 1.53; 95% C. I. (1.3-.181); p < .001] after controlling for age and educational level. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: It is important to reduce the number of psychosocial risk factors faced by women in their 60s in order to reduce the likelihood of continued cigarette smoking.",
