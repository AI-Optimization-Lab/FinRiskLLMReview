  "title": "Measuring systemic risk during the COVID-19 period: A TALIS3 approach",
  "abstract": "The rapid spread of COVID-19 has had severe impacts on financial markets. We analyzed the systemic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in different supersectors of STOXX600 North America and the STOXX600 Europe, using the TrAffic Light System for Systemic Stress (TALIS(3)) approach which provides a comprehensive color-based classification for grouping sectors according to system and sector stress level. We contrasted the financial markets' reaction in North America and Europe, noticing that in Europe the systemic impact has been more persistent during March-May 2021. By evaluating the sectorial contribution to market risk, we observed heterogeneity between North America and Europe.",
