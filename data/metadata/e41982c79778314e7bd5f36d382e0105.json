  "title": "RISK MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT IN ANTICRISIS MANAGEMENT OF INTERMEDIARY TRAVEL AGENCIES",
  "abstract": "The article presents the results of the research in the field of risk management at the travel agencies, criteria for risk areas classification are stated and these areas are classified. A chart scheme of the risk management process within the mechanism of anticrisis management is created. For risk determination in the financial resources usage three indices of financial firmness are offered.",
