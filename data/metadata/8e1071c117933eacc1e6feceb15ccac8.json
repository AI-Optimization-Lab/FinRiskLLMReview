  "title": "Three approaches to the estimation of market model betas",
  "abstract": "The article describes the portfolio market model based on bivariate normality of returns on an. individual and on the market portfolio. The parameters of the estimated market model are those of the regression function which we use for estimating the parameters of the market model. The investors are mostly interested in estimating betas what can be done either by creating classical confidence intervals, or by using Bayesian approach or by making direct use of the results of the simple regression.",
