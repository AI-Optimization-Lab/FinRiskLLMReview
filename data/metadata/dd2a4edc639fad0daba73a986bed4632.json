  "title": "Injury epidemiology of workers by age, sex and industrial classification using the medical claim data of National Health Insurance in South Korea, 2012-2015: a population-based retrospective study",
  "abstract": "Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the risk of inpatient hospitalisation for all-cause injuries, according to age, sex and industrial classification (IC) in South Korea. Design A population-based retrospective study. Setting and participants Data from the National Health Insurance Database on medical claims for the entire population of South Korean workers aged 25-59 years from January 2012 to December 2015 were retrieved. We observed 30 900 712 person-years (63.1%) in male workers and 18 105 272 person-years (36.9%) in female workers. Main outcome measures The inpatient hospitalisation for all-cause injury was defined as admission for which the principal diagnosis included S00-T98 in the Korean version of International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. Results Of 788 575 hospitalisations for all-cause injuries from 2012 to 2015, there were 565 107 cases in male workers (1 828.8 per 100 000 person-years) and 223 468 cases in female workers (1 234.3 per 100 000 person-years). The top five ICs with hospitalisation rate ratios (HRR) for all-cause injuries in both sexes compared with the financial intermediation IC included agriculture, hunting and forestry (HRR (95% CI); male: 2.09 (1.98 to 2.20); female: 1.53 (1.40 to 1.67)); mining and quarrying (male: 2.05 (1.92 to 2.19); female: 1.54 (1.27 to 1.87)) and fishing (male: 1.68 (1.57 to 1.80); female: 1.71 (1.51 to 1.93)). A U-shaped relationship occurred between age and risk for injuries in males; however, only a linear relationship was shown in females, regardless of IC. Conclusions The risk of injures varied by IC. The workers in agriculture, hunting, forestry, mining, quarrying and fishing were more vulnerable to injuries. The risk for injuries were higher among men and the age effect on this risk differed by sex. Thus, policy makers need to consider specific measures for prevention of injuries according to age, sex and IC.",
