  "title": "Addressing hunger among households with children utilizing food assistance resources: an analysis of food pantry users",
  "abstract": "AimHouseholds with children have higher rates of food insecurity compared to households without children. Financial instabilities, including job loss, decreased income, and family structure changes are food insecurity risk factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, programs were implemented to alleviate the impacts on food insecurity, but those expanded benefits were decreased in March 2023, leaving many families with economic burden.Subject and methodsThis study used a cross-sectional survey administered to food pantry users across ten food pantries in Eastern Massachusetts from June to August 2018, with 279 users reporting at least one child in the household. The outcome, hunger, was assessed using a modified version of the Household Hunger Scale. Households were categorized (one child, two children, or three or more children). Mixed-effects logistic regression models assessed the relationship between hunger categories and number of children in the household.ResultsThis study found that having more children in the household increases the severity of hunger. Households with at least three children had 1.46 times the odds (95% CI: 1.08, 1.97) of moderate hunger and 1.85 times the odds (95% CI: 1.11, 3.07) of severe hunger compared to one-child households. Severe hunger was associated with monthly household income, with higher incomes having a protective effect for severe hunger.ConclusionPrograms and policies addressing food insecurity are critical for supporting households with children already accessing supports, so removal of benefits may impact food insecurity. A multi-pronged approach including government-funded benefits and food pantry services is most effective in alleviating food insecurity.SignificancePrevious studies show that food insecurity increases with more children in the household compared to households without children, but focus less on populations already utilizing food assistance programs such as food pantries. This study examines hunger in households with children who are already at risk for food insecurity and receive food pantry services. Studying this population is essential given the recent decision by the US government to remove expanded COVID-19 benefits addressing food insecurity. Households with children experiencing food insecurity now depend upon those benefits and will be affected by their removal. These study findings can inform future resource allocation.",
