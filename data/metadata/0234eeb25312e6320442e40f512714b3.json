  "abstract": "BACKGROUND The need for extensive surgical debridement with necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) may put patients at high risk for unplanned readmission. However, there is a paucity of data on the burden of readmission in patients afflicted with NSTI. We hypothesized that unplanned readmission would significantly contribute to the burden of disease after discharge from initial hospitalization. METHODS The Nationwide Readmission Database was used to identify adults undergoing debridement for NSTI hospitalizations from 2010 to 2017. Risk factors for 90-day readmission were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS There were a total of 82,738 NSTI admissions during the study period, of which 25,076 (30.3%) underwent 90-day readmissions. Median time to readmission was 25 days (interquartile range, 9-49 days). Fragmentation of care, longer length of index stay (>2 weeks), and Medicaid status were independent risk factors for readmission. Median cost of a readmission was US $10,543. Readmission added 174,640 hospital days to episodes of care over the study period, resulting in an estimated financial burden of US $1.4 billion. CONCLUSION Unplanned readmission caused by NSTIs is common and costly. Interventions that target patients at risk for readmission may help decrease the burden of disease.",
