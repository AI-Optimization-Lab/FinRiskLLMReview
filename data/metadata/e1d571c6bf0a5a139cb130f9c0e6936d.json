  "title": "THE USEFULNESS OF CASH FLOW STATEMENTS IN BANK LENDING DECISIONS: INSIGHTS FROM BULGARIAN PRACTICES",
  "abstract": "This study examines the role and utility of the Statement of Cash Flows in the credit decision-making process from the perspective of Bulgarian banks. The main purpose is to evaluate how banks use the Statement of Cash Flows to assess the creditworthiness and financial health of the enterprises. A survey of leading Bulgarian banks reveals differences in how they understand and use this information in credit analysis. The findings reveal that, although banks acknowledge the importance of the Statement of Cash Flow for assessing liquidity and risk, it is often overshadowed by other financial reports such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Common issues identified include improper classification of cash flows and lack of clarity in the regulation of noncash transactions, which hinders the full utility of the Statement of Cash Flows in the credit evaluation process. Although the Statement of Cash Flows is useful for evaluating credit risk, the research identifies limitations in its current use by banks. Recommendations to improve Cash flow statement structure and credit assessments using cash flow information are provided.",
