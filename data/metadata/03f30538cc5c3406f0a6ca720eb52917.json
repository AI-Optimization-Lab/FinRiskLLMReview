  "title": "Loan Portfolio and Sustainability in Financial Institutions: An Empirical Study of Indian MFIs",
  "abstract": "This paper studies the loan portfolio management and financial health status of Indian Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs), devoted mostly in rural sector. Taking secondary data on operational parameters of different categories of MSMEs, it compares financial performance of different units, across categories. The present paper, using regression model analysis finds that NBFC-MFIs are better managed microfinance organizations, which have successfully exploited the capital market for market driven funds. It uses NPA related indicators and offbalance-sheet data for statistical analysis.",
