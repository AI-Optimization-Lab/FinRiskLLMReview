  "title": "A Technology Classification Model for Mobile Content and Service Delivery Platforms",
  "abstract": "The growing complexity of mobile rich media digital contents and services requires the integration of next generation middleware platform within Mobile Network Operators and Service Providers infrastructural architecture, for supporting the overall process of content creation, management and delivery. The purpose of the research is to design a technology classification model for Content & Services Delivery Platforms - CSDPs -, the core of Mobile Middleware Technology Providers - MMTPs - value proposition. A three-steps theoretical framework is provided, which identifies a set of significant classification variables to support the platforms positioning analysis. Afterwards, through adopting the multiple case studies research methodology, the model is applied to map the current CSDP offer presented by a sample of 24 companies, classified as MMTP, so to test the framework validity and get a valuable insight on the actual state of the art for such solutions. The main findings show that existing platforms possess major strengths - e.g. wide content portfolio manageable, integration between mobile and web channels and frequent recourse to SOA and Web Service approach -, while some drawbacks - poor support to context aware and location-based services, verticality and low interoperability of some proprietary products, criticality of content adaptation etc. - are still limiting the solutions effectiveness.",
