  "title": "The short-term effects of fixed copayment policy on elderly health spending and service utilization: evidence from South Korea's age-based policy using exact date of birth",
  "abstract": "A large number of the poor elderly in Korea have been exposed to the risk of insufficient proper medical treatments because of financial restrictions. South Korea launched policies to reduce the cost-sharing burden on the elderly, including one compelling the elderly to pay a fixed out-of-pocket amount for outpatient treatments. The impacts of such policies, however, have yet to be elucidated. In this paper, we estimate the short-term effects of the fixed outpatient copayment policy on the health-related behavior of the elderly. We employed a regression discontinuity design by using the exact days before and after the sample's 65th birthdate as the assignment variable, along with the restricted individual-level 2012 and 2013 National Health Insurance claims data. Results show that the policy increased the elderly's health service utilization numbers and reduced out-of-pocket spending for insured services. Moreover, the effects on prescription spending and the insurer's burden differed depending on beneficiaries' characteristics.",
