  "title": "Determinants of Default Risks and Risk Management: Evidence from Rural Banks in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the determinants of default risk of rural banks in East Java, Indonesia. The method used is descriptive verification and logistic regression analysis. The data used is secondary in the form of monthly annual financial reports of rural banks in East Java during the period 2009-2018. From the results, it was shown that net interest margin (NIM) as a proxy of market risk, non-perfonning loan (NPL) as a proxy of credit risk, operation efficiency as a proxy of operational risk and return on assets (ROA) as a proxy of profitability have a significant influence on default risk. Meanwhile, the loan to deposit (LDR) ratio as a proxy of liquidity risk has no significant influence on default risk. Banks need to implement risk management and meet the capital adequacy requirements of regulators so that they are resistant to risk, and also, compliant with bank governance to be able to produce high returns for rural banks have an impact on sustainability and its existence. The ability to identify setbacks in bank conditions and the ability to distinguish between healthy and problematic banks will enable to anticipate default banks.",
