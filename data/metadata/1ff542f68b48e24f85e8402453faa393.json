  "title": "The impact of neural networks in finance",
  "abstract": "The financial industry is becoming more and more dependent on advanced computer-technologies in order to maintain competitiveness in a global economy. Neural networks represent an exciting technology with a wide scope for potential applications, ranging from routine credit assessment operations to driving of large scale portfolio management strategies. Some of these applications have already resulted in dramatic increases in productivity. This paper brings together, from diverse sources, a collection of current research issues on neural networks in the financial domain. It examines a range of neural network systems related to financial applications from different levels of maturity to fielded products. It discusses the success rate of the neural network systems, and their performance in resolving particular financial problems.",
