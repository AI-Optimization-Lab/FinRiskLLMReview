  "title": "Currency hedging for international stock portfolios: The usefulness of mean-variance analysis",
  "abstract": "We test whether hedging currency risk improves the performance of international stock portfolios. We show that an auxiliary regression provides a wealth of information about the optimal portfolio holdings for non-mean-variance investors, analogous to the information provided by the Jensen regression about optimal portfolio holdings for the mean-variance case. We find that static hedging with currency forwards does not lead to significant improvements in portfolio performance for a US-Dollar based stock portfolio from the G5 countries, whereas dynamic hedges that are conditional on the interest rate spread do. These conclusions hold for both mean-variance and power utility investors and show up both in-sample and out-of-sample. However, the optimal forward positions can differ significantly for both types of investors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
