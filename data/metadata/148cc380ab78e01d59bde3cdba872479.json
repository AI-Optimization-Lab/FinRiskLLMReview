  "title": "Credit Risk Evaluation Model on listed corporations in China based on Principal Components Analysis and Grey Theory",
  "abstract": "This paper is to establish credit risk evaluation model adjusted to listed corporations in China, combining theoretical approach and Empirical Analysis research method. The model uses Principal Components Analysis to extract the main variable indicators for credit risk evaluation, and Grey Theory to establish the evaluation system. Then financial data of listed corporations in China's household appliance industry in 2007 were used as samples to do empirical research, and conspicuous results were made. The model provides an appropriate approach to effectively evaluate credit risk of listed corporations for financial institutions and capital markets participants. Thus, it is also an essential measure to promote the healthy development of capital markets positive initiatives.",
