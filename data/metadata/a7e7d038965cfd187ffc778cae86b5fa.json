  "title": "Optimizing a portfolio of mean-reverting assets with transaction costs via a feedforward neural network",
  "abstract": "Optimizing a portfolio of mean-reverting assets under transaction costs and a finite horizon is severely constrained by the curse of high dimensionality. To overcome the exponential barrier, we develop an efficient, scalable algorithm by employing a feedforward neural network. A novel concept is to apply HJB equations as an advanced start for the neural network. Empirical tests with several practical examples, including a portfolio of 48 correlated pair trades over 50 time steps, show the advantages of the approach in a high-dimensional setting. We conjecture that other financial optimization problems are amenable to similar approaches.",
