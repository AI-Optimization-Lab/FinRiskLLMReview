  "title": "The impact of liberalization and foreign investment in Colombia's financial sector",
  "abstract": "This study analyzes financial liberalization measures undertaken in 1990, of which an opening to foreign investment was a major component. After a brief description of the major changes in legislation on foreign investment, we compare performance of foreign-owned vs. domestic banks, first using a descriptive approach, then in a more systematic manner using econometric analysis. Panel data estimations reveal that financial liberalization in general had a beneficial impact on bank behavior in Colombia, by increasing competition, lowering intermediation costs and improving loan quality. Although the positive contribution of foreign entry may be overstated in recent studies by not controlling for other liberalization factors, foreign land domestic) entry beginning in 1990 did improve bank behavior by enhancing operative efficiency and competition. However, the greater competition may have resulted in increased risk and a subsequent deterioration in loan quality, particularly among domestic banks. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
