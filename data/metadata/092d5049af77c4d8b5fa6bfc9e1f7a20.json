  "title": "Risk Spillover Effects of Chinese Listed Commercial Banks Based on Dynamic CoVaR",
  "abstract": "In recent years, the development of Chinese financial market has experienced ups and downs. The financial risks have revealed the fragility of Chinese financial system. There is also bank systemic risk in different degrees behind the crisis. The banking effect research system is most closely related to the capital market and social economy. Thus, it has great significance to measure and transmit the systemic risk of banks. This paper uses the dynamic CoVaR method based on quantile regression to measure the systemic risk contribution of 13 listed commercial banks in China by using the weekly yield and other state variables, including the state owned banking system and the joint stock banking system.",
