  "abstract": "In the southwest mountains, a lot of dangerous rock bands are widely distributed, whose formation conditions are complex, which are diverse, specially located and dangerous. How to reinforce such complex unstable rock band? In this paper, the treatment of typical dangerous rock band is taken as an example, the classification investigation and one by one evaluation is performed first, and then each block composing the complex and dangerous rock band is analyzed and calculated. According to the site conditions and calculated results of each block composing the dangerous rock, using clearing risk - repairing - reinforcement- landscaping and other technology portfolio approach, forming a comprehensive treatment program to conduct a thorough treatment for each dangerous rock, it is proved that such a reinforcement technique has good effects with the management of dangerous rock.",
