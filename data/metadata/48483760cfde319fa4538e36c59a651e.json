  "title": "Enterprise generative artificial intelligence technologies, Internet of Things and blockchain-based fintech management, and digital twin industrial metaverse in the cognitive algorithmic economy",
  "abstract": "Research background: Enterprise generative AI system-based worker behavior tracking and monitoring, socially responsible organizational practices, employee performance management satisfaction, and human resource management procedures, relationships, and outcomes develop on hiring and objective performance assessment algorithms in terms of human resource management activities, functions, processes, practices, policies, and productivity. Deep reinforcement and machine learning techniques, operational and analytical generative AI and cloud capabilities, and real-time anomalous behavior recognition systems further fintech development for credit and lending services, payment analytics processes, and risk assessment, monitoring, and mitigation. Generative AI tools can bolster predictive analytics by collaborative and interconnected sensor and machine data for tailored, seamless, and finetuned product, operational process, and organizational workflow development, efficiency, and innovation, driving agile transformative changes in digital twin industrial metaverse. Purpose of the article: We show that enterprise generative AI-driven schedule prediction tools, job search and algorithmic hiring systems, and synthetic training data can improve team selection, job performance and firing decisions, hiring decision processes, and workforce productivity in terms of prediction and decision-making by use of algorithmic management, system performance, and production process tracking tools. Blockchain-based fintech operations can shape cloud-based financial and digital banking services, quote-to-cash process automation, cash-settled crypto futures, digital loan decisioning, asset tokenization simulated transactions, transaction switching and routing operations, tailored peer-to-peer lending, and proactive credit line management. Collaborative unstructured enterprise data processing, infrastructure, and governance can develop on AI decision and behavior automation technology, retrieval augmented generation and development management systems, and real-time data descriptive and predictive analytics, driving productivity surges and competitive advantage in digital twin industrial metaverse. Methods: Reference and review management tools, together with evidence synthesis screening software, harnessed were Abstrackr, AMSTAR, ASReview Lab, CASP, Catchii, Citation- chaser, DistillerSR, JBI SUMARI, Litstream, PICO Portal, and Rayyan. Findings & value added: The current state of the art is improved for theory on organizational issues and for policy making as deep learning-based generative AI tools and workplace monitoring systems can augment performance and productivity, gauge employee effectiveness, build resilient, satisfied, and engaged workforce, assess human capital, skill, and career development, drive employee and productivity expectations in relation to flexibility and stability, and shape turnover, retention, and loyalty. Cloud and account servicing technologies can be deployed in generative AI fintechs for embedded cryptocurrency trading, transaction moni toring and processing, digital asset transfers, payment screening, corporate and retail banking operations, and fraud prevention. Generative AI technologies can reshape jobs and reimagine meaningful work, involving creativity and innovation and adaptable and resilient sustained performance, providing valuable constructive feedback, optimizing workplace flexibility and psychological safety, and measuring and supporting autonomy and flexibility-based efficien- cy, performance, and productivity, while configuring demanding, engaging, and rewarding experiences by cloud and edge computing devices in digital twin industrial metaverse.",
