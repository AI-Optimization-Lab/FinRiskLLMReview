  "title": "Does gold or Bitcoin hedge economic policy uncertainty?",
  "abstract": "Calculating the hedge and safe-haven properties of gold and Bitcoin via GARCH model and quantile regression with dummy variables. We find that: (1) Neither gold nor Bitcoin can serve as a strong hedge or safe-haven for economic policy uncertainty (EPU) at the average condition. (2) Bitcoin is more responsive to EPU shocks, while gold maintains stability with smaller hedge and safe-haven coefficients. (3) In most cases, both gold and Bitcoin can act as the weak hedge and weak safe-haven against EPU during the extreme bearish and bullish markets, which two can be considered for portfolio diversification during the normal market.",
