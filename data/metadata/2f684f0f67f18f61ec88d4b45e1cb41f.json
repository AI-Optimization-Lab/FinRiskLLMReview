  "title": "Research on Credit Risk Recognizing Model in Enterprises of Credit-sale",
  "abstract": "In this paper, by Logit regression technology, we construct a model for recognizing and warning credit risk based on financial and non-financial Ratios. The test's resualt show that the accuracy of the model is up to 86.6%.Obversely, it can offer enterprise some supports for recognizing and warning credit risk in credit sale.",
