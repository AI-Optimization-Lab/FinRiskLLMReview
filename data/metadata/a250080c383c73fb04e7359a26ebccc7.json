  "title": "Combining Value-Focused Thinking and PROMETHEE Techniques for Selecting a Portfolio of Distributed Energy Generation Projects in the Brazilian Electricity Sector",
  "abstract": "This article aims to propose a multi-criteria model to support decision-making from a portfolio in selecting technologies for Distributed Generation of Energy (DGE) projects based on the characteristics of the geographic space in Brazil. The decision model involves using multi-criteria to support the evaluation, prioritization, and selection of projects under a multistage decision-making process that fits into a strategic management cycle within the energy sector of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil). The over-classification techniques Preference Ranking Organization Technique for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) II and V were applied under the Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) approach, reflecting the decision-maker or manager preferences among several conflicting criteria in the investment context of sustainable distributed energy generation projects. Based on real data, a numerical application is employed to view the steps of this decision model and illustrate the adequacy and effectiveness in practical issues of portfolio management.",
