  "title": "Study and Prevention of Systematic Risk of Insurance Industry of China",
  "abstract": "The insurance industry is a risk management industry which cannot be ignored in the financial system. It promotes the stable development of the market economy with its special social and economic compensation mechanism. Therefore, to explore the systemic risk of insurance industry can prevent the spread of financial risks and ensure the healthy development of China's market economy. The quantile regression of CoVaR has good pertinence to the measurement of systematic risk of insurance industry. Adopting the method of CoVaR, this paper took the China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited as the representative enterprise to measure and analyze spillover effect of the systematic risk of Chinese insurance company. The countermeasures from the realistic perspective were put forward to decrease the possibility of risk's breakout.",
