  "title": "Dtree: An Online Visualization Platform for Decision Analysis",
  "abstract": "This paper discusses the conceptualization and design of Dtree, an online visualization platform for conducting decision-tree-based decision analysis. Dtree aims to bring the functions of abstracting decision question, sophisticated math analysis of decision scenarios, and interactive visualization of the analysis output under a single coherent system in a web environment. We conceptualized a spiral and rising process of data-model-knowledge cycle emphasizing the interactivity, through a form of interactive report/webpage, of the model analysis output that bridges the gap and enable the cross-feeding between knowledge and data in an iterative manner. In visualization design of Dtree, we obey a couple of principles such as easy tree navigation and simplified control of analytical functions in order to optimize its usability. Furthermore, we also outline the technical implementation of Dtree, for both the front end and the back end. Finally, the functionalities of Dtree are demonstrated with a real-world application in medical industry. We believe that our experiment with realization of an online decision analytical program adds great value to the existing portfolio of decision making analysis toolbox.",
