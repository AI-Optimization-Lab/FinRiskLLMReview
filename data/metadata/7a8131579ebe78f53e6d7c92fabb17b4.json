  "title": "Design of Financial Risk Early Warning System in Enterprise Economic Management Based on Cluster Algorithm",
  "abstract": "When the domestic and foreign market economic environment has undergone great changes, it is very important to analyze the financial risk early warning in the economic management of enterprises. Financial risk belongs to the basic content of enterprise economic management, it is more pay attention to the risk main body is the participants of the market economy and competitors, research scholars research on the definition of this theory is divided into two aspects, on the one hand that belongs to the enterprise financial activities of the enterprise financial risk is influenced by uncertain factors causing income appeared deviation; On the other hand, financial risk is the uncertainty of the enterprise using monetary funds to repay maturing debts. In this paper, the enterprise economic management of financial risk early warning to start from the main points, and then according to the interdisciplinary perspective of systematic thinking on how to build a financial risk early warning system, and clustering algorithm as the core of the technical platform for empirical analysis. The final results show that the financial risk early warning system has application advantages in enterprise economic management based on clustering algorithm.",
