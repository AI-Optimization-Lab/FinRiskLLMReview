  "abstract": "Introduction: Due to immunosuppression and underlying comorbidities, transplant recipients represent a vulnerable population following emergency general surgery (EGS) operations. The present study sought to evaluate clinical and financial outcomes of transplant patients undergoing EGS. Methods: The 2010-2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for adults (>= 18 years) with nonelective EGS. Operations included bowel resection, perforated ulcer repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy and lysis of adhesions. Patients were classified by transplant history (Non-transplant, Kidney/Pancreas, Liver, Heart/Lung). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality while perioperative complications, resource utilization and readmissions were secondarily considered. Multivariable regression models evaluated the association of transplant status on outcomes. Entropy balancing was employed to obtain a weighted comparison to adjust for intergroup differences. Results: Of 7,914,815 patients undergoing EGS, 25,278 (0.32 %) had prior transplantation. The incidence of transplant patients increased temporally (2010: 0.23 %, 2020: 0.36 %, p < 0.001) with Kidney/Pancreas comprising the largest proportion (63.5 %). Non-transplant more frequently underwent appendectomy and cholecystectomy while transplant patients more commonly received bowel resections. Following entropy balancing, Liver was associated with decreased odds of mortality (AOR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.54-0.83, Reference: Non-transplant). Incremental hospitalization duration was longer in Liver and Heart/Lung compared to Non-transplant. Odds of acute kidney injury, readmissions and costs were higher in all transplant types. Conclusion: The incidence of transplant recipients undergoing EGS operations has increased. Liver was observed to have lower mortality compared to Non-transplant. Transplant recipient status, regardless of organ, was associated with greater resource utilization and non-elective readmissions. Multidisciplinary care coordination is warranted to mitigate outcomes in this high-risk population. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
