  "abstract": "This article describes design considerations of two interrelated programs that together make Learning Portfolio (LEAP) prototype system far accessing engineering information for engineers. The two programs are: Engineering Information Sources and Access (EISA), implemented as a Web-based self-learning prototype system; and Information Sources that Every Engineer should Know; ISEEK adds embedded instructional layer, representative queries, and constitutes the core layer of engineering sources for a beginner engineering student. Of analytical significance, the project has (1) defined indicators of information literacy (IL) for engineering students; (2) developed IL questionnaire to test engineering students' IL skills; (3) developed information literacy profile of engineering students under study; (4) assessed existing information resources, tools and search techniques. Of practical significance, we have: (5) applied students' responses in the design of EISA; (6) implemented the EISA information literacy program for engineers; (7) developed a series of hypertext-based tutorials each dealing with a specific IL issue; and (8) proposed set of the four design principles (i.e., understanding the user; active learning; conceptual model of teaching; and modularity). Finally, the article identifies and discusses future work.",
