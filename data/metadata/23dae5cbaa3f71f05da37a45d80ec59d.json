  "title": "Corporate Governance and Financial Distress in the Indonesia Banking Sector: An Empirical Study",
  "abstract": "Studying the relationship between corporate governance, interest rate risk and financial distress is the aim of this study. To examine this relationship, interest rate risk is used as a moderating variable. The variables used in this study are the board of directors and institutional ownership as proxies for corporate governance, and net interest margin is used as a proxy for interest rate risk. The research was conducted on the conventional banking sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the period 2015-2019. Sampling of data using purposive sampling method. Data analysis to determine the relationship and hypothesis testing using logistic regression. The results showed that institutional ownership had a negative effect on financial distress at a significance level of less than 5%, while interest rate risk had a negative effect on a significance level of less than 10%, and the board of directors had a negative but insignificant effect. Interest rate risk acts as a moderating variable in determining the relationship between institutional ownership and financial distress. Institutional ownership has an impact on increasing financial distress in banks with high interest rate risk.",
