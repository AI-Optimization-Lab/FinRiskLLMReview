  "title": "Research on the Application of Data Mining In the Financial Risk Early Warning of Listing Corporation",
  "abstract": "Based on the CRISP-DM process, studied the data mining Logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, neural network model and their application in the financial risk early warning of listed Companies. According to four models can predict the response rate and chose Logistic regression as the final model of data mining, and in accordance with the actual situation of Chinese listed companies to build the financial early warning system. By choosing the electronics industry listed companies as samples, based on the financial data of normal listed companies and ST companies, and conducting experiments to evaluate the model, the results show that: in the CRISP-DM process, based on Logistic regression data mining technology to establish financial risk prediction model, predicting the correct rate and response rate more than 85%, the stability of the model is higher, and verify the effectiveness of the data mining technology in the financial risk warning.",
