  "title": "Ontario's Healthy Babies Healthy Children Screen tool: identifying postpartum families in need of home visiting services in Ottawa, Canada",
  "abstract": "Intervention Across Ontario, the Healthy Babies Healthy Children (HBHC) postpartum screening tool is routinely used to identify families with potential risk of negative development outcomes for children. Research question To identify screening questions associated with subsequent high-risk in-depth assessment (IDA) in order to prioritize services. Methods Ottawa families who gave birth (2013-2016) consented to the postpartum HBHC Screen (N = 29,162). Maternal socio-demographics, perinatal indicators, and 36 questions assessing pregnancy/birth, family, parenting, infant development, and health professional observations were analyzed for association with a high-risk IDA using regression analysis. Results Upon first screen, 51% of families scored two or more risks. Most commonly, labour/delivery complications (27%), previous loss (26%), health professional concerns (22%), and mental illness (17%) were identified. Among IDA completions, 41% were assessed as high risk and this proportion increased when screened with 4+ risks. Characteristics associated with high - risk IDA among families scoring two or three included the following: maternal age <= 19 years (aRR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.50-2.80), 20-29 years (1.3, 1.12-1.53), >= 35 years (1.2, 1.04-1.45); combination breast and formula feeding on discharge (1.2, 1.03-1.37); <18 years old at birth of first child (1.7, 1.13-2.43); single parent and no partner involved (1.6, 1.07-2.33); high school incomplete (1.8, 1.45-2.35); newcomer support needed (1.8, 1.43-2.17); financial concerns (1.6, 1.27-2.14); history of mental Illness (1.2, 1.01-1.33); and parent disability (1.7, 1.09-2.78). Conclusion While offering the IDA when scoring 2+ risks is a provincial requirement, practices of increasing effort toward contacting families screened with 4+ risks are substantiated. An adapted approach to prioritize families screened with two or three risks is described.",
