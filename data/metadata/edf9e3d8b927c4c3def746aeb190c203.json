  "title": "Correlates of Depressive Symptoms Among Hispanic Older Adults Living in Public Housing",
  "abstract": "The study explored determinants of depressive symptoms among 297 Hispanic older adults living in public housing (M-age = 76.0, SD = 7.74). Following a basic stress model, the focus was on the effects of demographic variables, risk factors (functional disability, self-perceived health, and acculturation), and social resources (network of relatives and network of friends). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that financial status, which was a significant predictor in the initial model, became non-significant when risk factors were taken into consideration. All three risk factors were found to be significant; depressive symptoms were predicted by greater levels of functional disability, more negative self-perceived health, and lower levels of acculturation. In the final model, networks of both relatives and friends were shown to be significant even after we controlled for the effects of demographics and risk factors. Findings discussed in the article were made in the context of culture and residential setting.",
