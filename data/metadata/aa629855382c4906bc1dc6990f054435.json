  "title": "Understanding and predicting systemic corporate distress: a machine-learning approach",
  "abstract": "In this paper we study systemic nonfinancial corporate sector distress using firmlevel probabilities of default, covering 55 economies and spanning the last three decades. Systemic corporate distress is identified by elevated probabilities of default across a large portion of the firms in an economy. A machine-learning-based early-warning system is constructed to predict the risk of systemic distress in one year's time. Our results show that credit expansion, monetary policy tightening, overvalued stock prices and debt-linked balance-sheet weaknesses predict corporate distress. We also find that systemic corporate distress events are associated with contractions in gross domestic product. Their impacts are milder than those of financial crises.",
