  "title": "Demographic and socioeconomic correlates of multimorbidity due to Non-communicable diseases among adult men in India: Evidence from the nationally representative survey (NFHS-5)",
  "abstract": "Background: Multimorbidity is the multiple chronic conditions due to Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for an extended period. Such chronic conditions are associated with an individual's livelihood and other factors. The study aims to determine the association between demographic and socioeconomic indicators with multimorbidity and its spatial differentials. Methods: The study has been conducted incorporating NFHS-5 (2019-2021) data. For statistical analysis, we have used bivariate analysis and a Multinomial Logistic Regression model at a 95% confidence interval (CI) to show the Odds Ratio (OR) of multimorbidity; and crude odds ratio to test the strength and precision of the association of effect of demographic and socioeconomic variables. The geospatial analysis was also done to show the geographic variation of multimorbidity. Results: The result revealed that the age group of 45-54 years (OR: 5.889; CI:4.763-7.281), those who were married (OR: 2.117; CI:1.664-2.693), belonged more affluent wealthy group (OR: 1.512; CI:1.195-1.912), overweight (OR: 2.022; CI:1.634-2.502), lived in eastern (OR: 2.328; CI:1.833-2.957) and southern region (OR: 1.973; CI:1.569-2.483) and consumed substances (OR: 1.164; CI:1.034-1.310) as well as consume alcohol (OR: 1.608; CI:1.427-1.811) are more likely to suffer with multimorbidity. Conclusions: Many aspects of the multimorbidity challenges still need to be understood to prevent and reduce its burden. Thus, more attention is required from epidemiologists, health researchers, and policymakers to reduce premature mortality due to NCDs, universal health coverage, financial risk protection, and access to essential healthcare services to achieve Sustainable Development Goal-3 (SDG-3) by 2030.",
