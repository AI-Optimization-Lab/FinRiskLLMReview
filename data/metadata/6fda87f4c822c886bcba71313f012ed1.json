  "abstract": "GARCH model can be used to describe the characteristics of returns fluctuation, which can forecast the returns and risk of financial assets. This paper makes use of GARCH model and its hybrid models, such as GARCH-M model, E-GARCH model, T-GARCH model and I-GARCH model, to the empirical research on the data of Shanghai Securities Composite Index from January 2, 2001 to May 20, 2013. The results show that there are the characteristics of High Kurtosis and Fat Tail, Volatility Clustering and the phenomenon of high risk and high reward.",
