  "title": "Bimodal Characteristic Returns and Predictability Enhancement via Machine Learning",
  "abstract": "This paper documents the bimodality of momentum stocks: both high- and lowmomentum stocks have nontrivial probabilities for both high and low returns. The bimodality makes the momentum strategy fundamentally risky and can cause a large loss. To alleviate the bimodality and improve return predictability, this paper develops a novel cross-sectional prediction model via machine learning. By reclassifying stocks based on their predicted financial performance, the model significantly outperforms off-the-shelf machine learning models. Tested on the U.S. market, a value-weighted long-short portfolio earns a monthly alpha of 2.4% (t-statistic = 6.63) when regressed against the Fama-French five factors plus themomentumand short-termreversal factors.",
