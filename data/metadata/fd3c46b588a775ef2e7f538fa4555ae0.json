  "title": "Currency Pair Trading Simulator using ML Models",
  "abstract": "The Currency Pair Trading Simulator is a software project designed to offer traders a realistic and risk-free environment for refining their currency pair trading strategies. Leveraging advanced technologies like SQLite, MongoDB, and pandas, the simulator utilizes historical price data, order execution algorithms, and machine learning models to create an accurate trading experience. Traders can experiment with different approaches, analyze historical data, and make data-driven decisions without risking real capital. Additionally, machine learning algorithms like XGBoost Regression help predict price movements and assess the effectiveness of trading strategies. This simulator offers several key advantages. It allows traders to practice and improve their trading strategies without the fear of financial losses. Traders can also evaluate the accuracy of prediction models and make necessary adjustments to their strategies. Furthermore, this tool is valuable for both novice and experienced traders, as well as financial and educational institutions, enabling them to enhance trading skills, conduct research, and improve risk management practices.",
