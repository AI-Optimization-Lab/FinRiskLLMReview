  "title": "A method of risk analysis about BOT project",
  "abstract": "Traditional financial valuation method about BOT project is discussed and the shortcoming of this method is pointed out when it is used to analysis project's risk. Based on it, rational risk-adjusted discount rate is calculated by CAPM model; a project risk management technology is introduced to the investment's risk analysis; risk and return about investment of BOT highway project is valued synthetically by discounted cash flow model which combines decision tree model and scenario analysis. So a brief and applied risk-return analysis method is presented.",
