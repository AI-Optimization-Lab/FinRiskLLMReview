  "title": "Performance of the China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme-based on CHNS data",
  "abstract": "Medical financial risk is the core issue in the process of new cooperative health reform. Based on the analysis of the factors affected participation and financial risk, NCMS did not reduce medical impoverishment effectively according to the result of 2006 CHNS data regression. On the contrary, health insurance encourages people to seek health care and increases the risk of high and catastrophic spending, the primary goal of expanding primary health care services and enlarging insurance coverage has not achieved as well. To further explore the reasons causing medical financial risk, the paper analyzes the relationship between individual's health condition and personal endowments, medical expenditure and insurance status in a micro way. It is found that physical condition is better for the non-participants. Adverse selection exists in China's new cooperative medical insurance market. Based on the results above, the paper puts forward reasonable suggestions, such as enlarging the scope of protection, eliminating geographic restriction, increasing government spending and developing optimal co-insurance rates etc. to achieve policy objectives at the end.",
