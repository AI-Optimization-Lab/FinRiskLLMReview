  "title": "Do green policies produce green jobs?",
  "abstract": "ObjectiveWe examine the relationship between clean energy policies and green job growth. MethodsUsing a set of meta-regression analyses, we assess the green job creation performance of a wide variety of policies in the American states. ResultsOur findings indicate that renewable portfolio standards and public benefit funds are systematically associated with increases in green jobs, although the effects of other policy tools are ambiguous at best. Effect estimates in the existing literature are significantly driven by how the dependent and core independent variables are measured. ConclusionOverall, our findings suggest that some policies may be an effective component of an energy-based economic development strategy, but that for others a more robust evidence base is needed in order to clarify their effects.",
