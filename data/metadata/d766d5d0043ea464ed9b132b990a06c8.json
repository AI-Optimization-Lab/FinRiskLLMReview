  "title": "RETRACTED: Risk Assessment of Agricultural Economic Management Based on the Multivariate Statistical Computing Method (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "The modernization process of Chinese agriculture has posed new challenges to agriculture economic management. However, existing studies focus on financial and ecological and environmental risks of agriculture economic management while lacking the necessary attention to other types of agricultural economic management. Therefore, we first propose that the risk of agricultural economic management is of five types-economic, social, political, cultural, and ecological and environmental risks-and further clarify the interactions among the five risk types. Given that the five types of risks are nested with each other, we adopted a multivariate statistical algorithm based on complex network theory to scientifically evaluate the risk management of agriculture economy. The results show the applicability of the algorithm to risk clustering analysis and risk coefficient estimation. The article concludes with the corresponding theoretical and practical implications.",
