  "title": "Risk Protection, Service Use, and Health Outcomes under Colombia's Health Insurance Program for the Poor",
  "abstract": "Unexpected medical care spending imposes considerable financial risk on developing country households. Based on managed care models of health insurance in wealthy countries, Colombia's Regimen Subsidiado is a publicly financed insurance program targeted to the poor, aiming both to provide risk protection and to promote allocative efficiency in the use of medical care. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that the program has shielded the poor from some financial risk while increasing the use of traditionally underutilized preventive services-with measurable health gains.",
