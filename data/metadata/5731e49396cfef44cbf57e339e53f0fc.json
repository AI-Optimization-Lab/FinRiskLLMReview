  "title": "Major financial problems, low mental well-being and reduced HIV/STI testing among sex workers in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional survey",
  "abstract": "Objectives To determine associations between the banning of sex work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and work, financial problems, mental well-being and HIV/sexually transmittable infection (STI) testing among sex workers in the Netherlands. Design Two cross-sectional online surveys. The first survey covered two time-periods: pre-COVID-19 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019) and period 1 (15 March 2020 to 1 July 2020). The second survey covered period 2 (1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021). Setting The Netherlands Participants In total, 106 (first survey) and 196 (second survey) sex workers participated. Most of the participants in the first and second survey were cisgender women (respectively, 76.4% and 66.5%), followed by cisgender men (respectively, 12.3% and 15.7%) and the combination of transgender men, transgender women, non-binary or other (respectively, 11.3% and 17.6%). Most participants were born in the Netherlands (respectively, 61.4% and 69.7%). Primary and secondary outcome measures We provide descriptive statistics of self-reported work during and prior to COVID-19 measures, financial problems due to COVID-19 measures and HIV/STI testing and mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also performed logistic and linear regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with reporting financial problems due to COVID-19 measures, not testing for HIV/STIs and lower mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results In periods 1 and 2, respectively, 69.6% and 62.0% reported financial problems due to the COVID-19 measures. Among those who reported to have had sex with clients, the percentage not HIV/STI testing was: 4.5% (95% CI: 0.9; 12.5) pre-COVID-19, 28.2% (95% CI: 15.0; 44.9) in period 1, and 15.2% (95% CI: 9.7; 22.3) in period 2. In the multivariate analysis, reported financial problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with not HIV/STI testing (OR: 12.1, p<0.001) and lower mental well-being (B: -2.7, p<0.001). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic control measures in the Netherlands were associated with major financial problems, low mental well-being and reduced HIV/STI testing among sex workers.",
