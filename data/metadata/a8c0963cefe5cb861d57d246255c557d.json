  "title": "Clustering and Comparative Analysis on Z Scores Time Series of Public Listed Companies in Non-ferrous Metal Industry",
  "abstract": "The global financial turmoil has brought grim situation to the world economy, in investment activities and corporate financial management, related early-warning indicators of financial risk become the focus of attention of the Stakeholders. This paper selects public listed companies of non-ferrous metal industry in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange as research object, to test the usefulness of Z score in Altman's Z-score predicting model, it showed that the original discriminant Value in the industry were too high; then, trying to cluster analysis based on time series of Z scores and discriminant the classification, and then testing the prediction of time series of Z score in the industry.",
