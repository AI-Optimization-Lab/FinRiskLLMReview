  "title": "Research on wave image analysis in the implied volatility of stock options",
  "abstract": "The study of volatility rarely starts from the perspective of implied volatility, and rarely combines stochastic volatility models with option pricing, which is a major flaw in research. Based on this, this study combined image processing technology to construct the wave image processing model and analyze the implied volatility of stock options and combined the image processing method to construct the implicit volatility surface output model. At the same time, the implied volatility surface model is constructed by mobile phone big data, image segmentation and noise processing are performed by image processing, and the performance of the model is analyzed by regression analysis. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the model. The results show that the model constructed in this paper has certain effects and can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research.",
