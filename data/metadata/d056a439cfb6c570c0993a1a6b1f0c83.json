  "title": "Risk-averse Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization",
  "abstract": "This investigation explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic portfolio optimization with risk assessment. The challenges include market complexity, uncertain reactions, and regulatory requirements for risk-averse decisions. Our solution leverages Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to capture uncertainties. We successfully implemented a risk-averse Reinforcement Learning algorithm, achieving 18 percent lower risk. Reinforcement Learning with risk-aversion shows promise for optimizing portfolios for risk-averse investors. (c) 2024 The Author(s).
