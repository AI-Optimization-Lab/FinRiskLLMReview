  "title": "Black-Litterman portfolio optimization based on GARCH-EVT-Copula and LSTM models",
  "abstract": "In constructing diversified portfolios, the investors might be interested in incorporating some quantifiable views or opinions. The Black-Litterman model is a useful approach to integrate investors' views into the Markowitz allocation model. In this paper we utilize a deep learning model to estimate the investors's views and use GARCH-EVT-Copula to model the dependence structure between stock market returns in a large portfolio. The findings show that the Black-Litterman model for portfolio optimization based on GARCH-EVT-Copula and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models gives better performances as compared with the traditional max-Sharpe and the original Black-Litterman portfolio problems.",
