  "title": "MODELLING THE CAUSAL RELATIONS ON THE CZECH CREDIT MARKET",
  "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to analyze the causal relations on the Czech credit market. Analysis of five selected characteristics is realized in period 2000-2010. It used the OLS regression analysis for estimate of model. The regression analysis showed that, in the analyzed period, the quality of portfolio and the concentration of the credit market have negative impact on total loans. The profitability (ROA) and two week repo rate have positive impact on total loans. The share of interest income to total income was excluded from the final model, because redundant variables test Likelihood ratio confirms, that these variables are not significant for the model.",
