  "abstract": "Bakken, I. J., Wenzel, H. G., Gotestam, K. G., Johansson, A. & Oren, A. (2009). Internet addiction among Norwegian adults: A stratified probability sample study. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 50, 121-127. Most Norwegians are Internet users. We conducted a stratified probability sample study (Norway, 2007, age-group 16-74 years, N = 3,399, response rate 35.3%, 87.1% Internet users) to assess the prevalence of Internet addiction and at-risk Internet use by the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ). The prevalence of Internet addiction (YDQ score 5-8) was 1.0% and an additional 5.2% were at-risk Internet users (YDQ score 3-4). Internet addiction and at-risk Internet use was strongly dependent on gender and age with highest prevalences among young males (16-29 years 4.1% and 19.0%, 30-39 years 3.3% and 10.7%). Logistic regression showed that male gender, young age, university level education, and an unsatisfactory financial situation were factors positively associated with problematic Internet use (at-risk and addicted use combined). Time spent on the Internet and prevalence of self-reported sleeping disorders, depression, and other psychological impairments increased linearly with YDQ score. Problematic Internet use clearly affects the lives of many people.",
