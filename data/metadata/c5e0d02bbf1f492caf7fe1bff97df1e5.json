  "title": "Modern methods of forming an innovation strategy of the banking sector of the economy",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to develop modern approaches to the formation of innovation strategies of credit institutions based on non-technological innovations. As a result of the analysis of theoretical material, a conceptual model was developed for the formation of the innovation policy of credit institutions, and the impact of non-technological innovations on the efficiency of their functioning was assessed. Based on the classification of the portfolio of innovation tools, a mathematical model has been developed and a methodology has been proposed for operative control over the process of implementing a set of innovation strategies included in the development plan of a credit institution.",
