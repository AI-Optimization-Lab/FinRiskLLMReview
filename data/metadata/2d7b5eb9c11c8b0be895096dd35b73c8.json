  "title": "Risk analysis for agrivoltaic projects in rural farming communities in SSA",
  "abstract": "Access to decentralized energy solutions is critical for the development of rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). One form of decentralized energy technology, agrivoltaics (AV), has gained attention in the last decade as a means to tackle energy poverty in off-grid communities. The success of renewable energy (RE) projects of any kind, however, depends on existing challenges and risks that may be faced at different stages. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the main risk factors when implementing agrivoltaics on a community level in SSA. Based on the PESTLE framework, the paper develops a first risk classification system for international agrivoltaic projects in rural farming communities in SSA. By making use of a mixedmethods approach, the research enables the prioritization of potential risks in terms of their occurrence and significance; furthermore, it discusses mitigation strategies. Results indicate that there are various multifaceted risks associated with agrivoltaics, primarily including financial challenges and regulatory barriers. In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of stakeholder involvement as well as a need for long-term community engagement and capacity building to ensure a successful implementation and sustainability of agrivoltaic projects.",
