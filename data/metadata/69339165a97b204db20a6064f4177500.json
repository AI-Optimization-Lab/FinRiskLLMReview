  "title": "Risk Management in a Changing World",
  "abstract": "Each human activity carries a range of risks, which include in its classification intermediate steps to identify them. As the economy is affected by global competition and globalization requirements of current policies, it is exposed to many risks and problems, which ultimately lead to investment failure or failure to achieve the desired results. Risk management as a science is based on the realistic analysis of economic phenomena, and as a shroud of the art of standard modeling. It is the scientific approach or approach to dealing with pure risk by anticipating possible losses to the investment by designing and implementing procedures that reduce the possibility of loss or minimize the financial impact of losses to the minimum. Risk management identifies and measures manages the risks to which the financial institution is exposed, for the sake of caution and control, neutralizing or minimizing the impact thereof. Therefore, risk management is a process of measuring and evaluating risks and developing strategies to manage them so as not to negatively affect the rates of stability and economic balance, as well as the rates of growth and economic development.",
