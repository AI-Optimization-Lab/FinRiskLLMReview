  "title": "Valuing American Options by Weighted Least-squares Quasi-Monte Carlo",
  "abstract": "American options pricing has the backward nature of iterative search feature. Based on the least-squares Monte Carlo(LSM), this paper employs Faure sequences and doubles the sample's number by antithetic variate method to decrease the variance of simulation. Then, underling assets are valued. Thus, weighted least-squares quasi-Monte Carlo (WLSQM) is proposed by weighted least-squares regression. Comparing the two methods with option value, standard error and computation cost, WLSQM is better than LSM, which validates WLSQM is efficient on pricing American options.",
