  "title": "Hedging derivative securities based on the neural network coefficient model",
  "abstract": "Investment in options has attracted much interest among investors for both speculative and hedging reasons in financial markets at present. Applying neural networks to forecast volatility in option pricing has increased in popularity in recent years since many studies have indicated that the conventional option pricing models are not sufficiently accurate. This article proposes a neural network coefficient (NNC) model to re-price option values to improve on the tracking error in the measurement of hedging capability. The NNC model uses the variables introduced by the Black-Scholes (BS) Model and applies the linear regression (LR) model to price option values. It is worth noting that each corresponding weight coefficient in LR is constructed by a complete neural network rather than by a scalar value. By capturing the nonlinear behaviors of option pricing, our proposed NNC model has lower tracking error and better hedging capability than the BS model. Besides, the experimental data are obtained from the Taiwan Stock Index Commodity (TIMEX) index options instead of artificially simulated data in order to avoid departing from reality.",
