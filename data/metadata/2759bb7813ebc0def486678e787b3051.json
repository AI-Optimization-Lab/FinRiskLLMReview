  "title": "Digital HP finance 's role in the economic resilience of enterprises ' digital transformation",
  "abstract": "To promote digital transformation by enterprises and provide more convenient and efficient financial services, this study analyzes enterprise digital transformation ' s promotion mechanism and economic influence factors globally and clarifies the role of inclusive digital finance in selfregulation and reducing financing difficulties during enterprise transformation. Finally, an economic resilience model is constructed to select parameters of economic factors, refined into two dimensions: enterprise transformation ability and enterprise upgrading ability. The digital economy is found to be conducive to improving the gross profit margin of enterprises with a significance greater than 0. A regression analysis shows that the estimated coefficients of the digital financial inclusion index, breadth of coverage, and depth of use are all significantly positive, and the different nature of the firms passes the significance test at the 1 % level. Thus, inclusive digital finance reduces the business risk of digital transformation and promotes the development of enterprises in the direction of specialization and innovation.",
