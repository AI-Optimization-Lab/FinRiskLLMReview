  "title": "ANALYSIS OF RISK VARIABLES IN ONLINE BANKING",
  "abstract": "The complexity and diversity of banking risks has been on the rise in recent years due to increased competition between banks and the increasing number of financial products and services. Innovative banking financial services aimed at serving the population of the digitalized environment have caused major changes in online banking risks. The complex changes and regulations, as well as the increase in the volume of digital data, represent only a few of the factors that determine the change. As a result the associated risks are numerous. Bank risks in the digital environment are generated by fraudulent actions made on data, failures of the online banking system, cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-activism etc. These cyber threats lead to a variety of risks affecting the online banking system, such as: financial risks (R11 - R13); operational risks (R14); security risks (R15); fraud risks (R16); money-laundering risks (R17); reputational risks (R18); technological risks (R19). All these risk categories will be the subject of this paper. The code (R11-R21) will be used for easier identification during the paper. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to identify bank risks from another perspective for establishing a framework of risk variables for the machine-learning model that will be developed in future research. In this paper, the literature review was the central source to confirm our results.",
