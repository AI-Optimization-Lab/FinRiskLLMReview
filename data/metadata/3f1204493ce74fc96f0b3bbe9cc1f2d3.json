  "title": "Leveraging momentum clustering and PID control for enhanced portfolio management",
  "abstract": "Efficient wealth management in dynamic financial environments is crucial for maximizing returns and mitigating risk. Therefore, this study presents an adaptive portfolio management strategy that combines momentum-based clustering, a Proportional-Integration-Derivative (PID) controller, and efficient frontier (EF) analysis to construct optimal portfolios in dynamic financial environments. A novel integration of a PID controller dynamically adjusts the asset weights to address the limitations of static optimization methods. EF analysis is then employed to identify portfolios with optimal risk-return trade-offs. Our dynamic strategy demonstrates competitive performance compared to conventional benchmarks. From 2017 to 2023, the approach yielded a cumulative return of 135.5%, surpassing Standard and Poor's 500 (46.66%), Russell's 2000 Index (11.47%) and NASDAQ (67.88%). These findings suggest that the integration of clustering techniques and PID controllers offers a promising approach for portfolio management. IMPACT STATEMENTThis research presents a novel framework integrating momentum clustering and PIDcontrol into portfolio management, leveraging a decade of S&P 500 stock data. Bycombining technical indicators, rolling factor betas, and dynamic optimization, thestrategy demonstrates superior adaptability to varying market conditions. The incorp-oration of advanced metrics, such as Sharpe and Sortino ratios, and efficient frontiermodeling ensures rigorous evaluation of performance. This approach outperforms tra-ditional benchmarks like the S&P 500 and DJIA and provides a scalable and robustsolution for achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns. The findings contribute signifi-cantly to the fields of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading by offering a meth-odology that bridges static optimization with real-time adaptability, addressing thechallenges of economic cyclicality and market volatility.",
