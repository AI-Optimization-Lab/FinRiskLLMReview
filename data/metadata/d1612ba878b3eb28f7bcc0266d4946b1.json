  "title": "The Influence of Interest Rate of Indonesian Central Bank Certificate and Non Performing Loan to Investment Loans in SME'S in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to obtain information and knowledge based on data and facts from the effect of SBI interest rate and non-performing loans to investment-lending in SMEs in Indonesia. The method used is a form of time series from the years 2011-2015 using quantitative methods with descriptive analysis. This data is presented every year on a monthly basis obtained from the website of Bank Indonesia (bi.go.id). This study uses the data time series regression model with Cochrane-Orcutt correction techniques. Based on the analysis of simultaneous, SBI interest rate and NPL have the significant effect on SME investment lending. Based on the results of a partial analysis, the SBI interest rate has no effect on investment lending SME and Non-Performing Loans have a significant negative effect on investment lending to the SMEs. The Variations influence of two independent variables can be determined based on the R2 value of 0.991465 which indicates that 99% of the variation in the SME loan portfolio was affected by the SBI interest rate and the NPL and the rest influenced by other factors outside the research method.",
