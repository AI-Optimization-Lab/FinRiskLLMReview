  "abstract": "Estimating the contribution of DSS to financial consulting decision-making is attracting considerable interest in the fast-growing field of banking DSS. This study evaluated the perceived role of banking DSS in the decision-making of investment counselors. A questionnaire was submitted to 40 investment counselors to determine the comparative importance of DSS information components. Data were analyzed using two complementary methods (analytical hierarchy processing and Neumann-Segev). The most important information components were customer's and investment risk classification, and customer goals and nature of investment. The results differed across administrative ranks and as a function of the user's experience level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
