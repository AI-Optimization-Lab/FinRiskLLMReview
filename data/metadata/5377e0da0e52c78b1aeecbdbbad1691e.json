  "title": "EFFECT OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON AIRLINES",
  "abstract": "Purpose - Considering the idiosyncratic industry structure and active participation in CSR implementation, this study investigates the effect of multiple CSR dimensions in an airline context. This study hypothesizes that disaggregated CSR dimensions may have varying effects on airline organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach - The information was mainly drawn from COMPUSTAT and the CRSP Stock/Portfolio using the standard industry classification code (SIC) 4512. KLD was also a source of CSR information. The study period was 2000-2012. Main findings - The study found that the employee dimension plays a significant role in enhancing profitability and airline quality rating and in mitigating systematic risk. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the product dimension positively affects airline value. Originality/value - The research contributes to the body of CSR and airline literature. The study results will also help practitioners allocate corporate resources to appropriate CSR activities.",
