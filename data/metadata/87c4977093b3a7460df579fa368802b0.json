  "title": "The relationship between socio-demographic factors and depression: a cross sectional study among civilian participants in hostilities in Ukraine",
  "abstract": "There is still a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to civilian participants in hostilities. This is despite the fact that there is an extensive body of literature on major depressive disorder (MDD) in individuals who have experienced armed conflict. The purpose of this article is to identify socio-demographic factors which are related to levels of depression among civilian participants in the war in Ukraine, based on a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2019 from a convenience sample of 314 Ukrainian adults (235 males). Depression was assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify possible predictors of depression. Significant predictors were: loss of a loved one, place of residence, age, health insurance, financial situation, and marital status (F (6, 224) = 10.515, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.21; Adjusted R-2 = 0.19). They also show that symptoms of depression resulting from the loss of a loved one due to war can be reduced through participation in an educational system. Having children is associated with a risk of more severe depression. Specialists are encouraged to engage in face-to-face interviews and to maintain a supportive and safe environment for participants in hostilities, e.g., in the area of education.",
