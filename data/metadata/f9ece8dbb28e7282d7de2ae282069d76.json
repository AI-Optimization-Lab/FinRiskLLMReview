  "title": "Factors Influencing Student Learning in Portfolio Assessed Introductory Programming",
  "abstract": "Constructive alignment combines constructive learning theories with aligned curriculum to promote deep learning. Using an action research methodology, this work reflects upon twelve iterations, over 6-years, of a project that aimed to implement constructive alignment using portfolio assessment for teaching introductory programming. Student results and staff reflections are used to highlight factors and principles that influenced the teaching and learning environment created. The paper advocates for the use of pragmatic constructive learning theories, aligned curriculum, formative feedback, and a positive view of student motivation. These insights can be used to help guide the development of student-centered teaching and learning environments.",
