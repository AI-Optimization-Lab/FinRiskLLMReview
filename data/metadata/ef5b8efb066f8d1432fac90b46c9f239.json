  "title": "Analysis of Influencing Factors of Financial Market Volatility Based on Cluster Analysis",
  "abstract": "The financial market has certain volatility in its stability due to the influence of many factors. In the analysis of the financial market, it is necessary to combine scientific and effective intelligent algorithms. Based on the cluster analysis algorithm, this paper analyzes the factors affecting financial market volatility. Moreover, this paper conducts a more in-depth study and summary of the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, derives the analysis and solution process of the improved algorithm in detail, and gives the steps to improve the clustering algorithm. In addition, this paper constructs an analysis model of financial market volatility influencing factors based on cluster analysis and establishes a supply chain financial credit risk evaluation index system that includes the quality of corporate managers, corporate indicators, and asset structure. Finally, this paper verifies the performance of the algorithm model of this paper through experimental research. It can be seen from the experimental research results that the methods and models proposed in this paper have certain effects.",
