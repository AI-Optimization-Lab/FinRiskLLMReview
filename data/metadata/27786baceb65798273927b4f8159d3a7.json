  "title": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING OF GREEN FINANCE AS AN ELEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION MANAGEMENT",
  "abstract": "Currently, the Ukrainian economy is beginning to implement the concept of green finance at the legislative level. But the minimum legal framework is already present to protect the environment of Ukrainians. The management of eco-innovation is essential, as most countries that negatively contribute to the sustainable environment are primarily countries with significant financial shortfalls. The article aims to determine the basic theoretical and practical principles of financial engineering of green finance as an element of environmental innovation management. European countries were selected to study the possibilities of financial engineering of green finance as an element of environmental innovation management. The study period is 2000-2020. The article analyzes and studies the main indicators of energy production and usage, adjusted savings, rent for using natural energy sources, Environmental Performance Index 2020, environmental health indicator, and other indicators for the studied countries. Regarding the possibilities of green financing in Ukraine, the existing normative legal acts are considered. For developing areas for improving the management of environmental innovations, this study was conducted in the following logical sequence: built a multifactor linear regression model net inflows of foreign direct investment; the influence of factors on the performance indicator is determined; the most influential factors for determining the directions of future improvement have been identified. The authors confirmed thAT the financial engineering of green finance is a tool that combines the world of finance, innovation, and business with environmental behavior. It is an activity area for many participants, including individual and business consumers, manufacturers, investors, and financial lenders. Unlike traditional financial activities, green finance focuses on environmental friendliness and pays more attention to the environment. Thus, investing in climate change and clean energy knowledge could better assess risk and return. Two important strategies in global sustainable development are energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources. As for the development of renewable energy industries, the main factor hindering the development of industrialization is the lack of capital and an effective financing mechanism.",
