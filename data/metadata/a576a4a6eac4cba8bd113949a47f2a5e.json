  "title": "Associations of socioeconomic status indicators and migrant status with risk of a low vegetable and fruit consumption in children",
  "abstract": "Background: It is important to provide insight in potential target groups for interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in children's vegetable/fruit consumption. In earlier studies often single indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) or migrant status have been used. However, SES is a multidimensional concept and different indicators may measure different SES dimensions. Our objective is to explore multiple associations of SES indicators and migrant status with risk of a low vegetable/fruit consumption in a large multi-ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of children. Methods: We included 5,010 parents of 4-to 12-year-olds from a Dutch public health survey administered in 2018. Cross-sectional associations of parental education, material deprivation, perceived financial difficulties, neighbourhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and migrant status with low (<= 4 days a week) vegetable and fruit consumption in children were assessed using multilevel multivariable logistic regression models. Results are displayed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of the 4-to 12-year-olds, 22.1% had a low vegetable consumption and 11.9% a low fruit consumption. Low (OR 2.51; 95%CI: 2.05, 3.07) and intermediate (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.54, 2.17) parental education, material deprivation (OR 1.45; 95%CI: 1.19, 1.76), low NSES (OR 1.28; 95%CI: 1.04, 1.58) and a non-Western migrant status (OR 1.94; 95%CI: 1.66, 2.26) were associated with a higher risk of a low vegetable consumption. Low (OR 1.68; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.17) and intermediate (OR 1.39; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.72) parental education and material deprivation (OR 1.63; 95%CI: 11.27, 2.08) were also associated with a higher risk of a low fruit consumption. Conclusion: Our findings indicate associations of multiple SES indicators and migrant status with a higher risk of a low vegetable/fruit consumption in children and thus help to identify potential target groups.",
