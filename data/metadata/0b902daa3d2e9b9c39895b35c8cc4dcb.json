  "title": "RATING FOR ASSESSMENT OF CREDIT UNIONS: AN APPLICATION OF THE PEARLS MODEL",
  "abstract": "As other financial organizations, to perform their activities credit unions carry out loans and intermediation operations, offering credit risk to other agents. The goal of this paper is to present a rating model for assessment of credit unions. It was used financial data available through the COSIF system of Central Bank of Brazil, the PEARLS model of economic-financial assessment and the classification methodology of the Brazilian Guarantee Fund for Credit Unions (FGCOOP). The rating model was estimated through multinomial logistic regression. The total accuracy was 80.1%. With the model results and considering its high accuracy degree, it is possible to verify that the use of PEARLS model allowed the development of a model for monitoring the risks that credit unions represent to financial market. The achieved rating model is simple and has a practical relevance to agents. The academic relevance is related to the methodology for economic-financial assessment of credit unions which can be a reference for future studies. Moreover, the relevance is highlighted due to lack of studies on ratings to assess financial firms in Brazil.",
