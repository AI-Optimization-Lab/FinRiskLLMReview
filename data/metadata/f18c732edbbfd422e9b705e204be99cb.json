  "title": "Factors associated with symptom distress in women with breast cancer prior to initiation of chemotherapy",
  "abstract": "Background: Symptom distress in women with breast cancer is associated with early discontinuation of chemotherapy and may influence treatment outcomes. Describing racial differences in prechemotherapy symptom distress and examining contextual variables of the symptom experience may inform our understanding of the complex problem of racial disparities in breast cancer. Aim: To determine if perceived social support, healthcare system distrust, and economic hardship predict symptom distress in women with breast cancer prior to their first chemotherapy treatment. Design: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional. Methods: Baseline data (N = 119) was used from a multisite, longitudinal study comparing the symptom experience and ability to receive chemotherapy of Black and White women with breast cancer (R01MD012245; Rosenzweig, PI). Measures included the Symptom Distress Scale, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Health Care System Distrust Scale, and Psychological Sense of Economic Hardship scale. The analysis consisted of multiple regression and a t-test. Results: On average, participants reported five symptoms prior to chemotherapy. Black women reported higher symptoms distress than White women; t(68.34) = 2.15, p = 0.035. The model explained 26% of variance in symptom distress; F(5, 112) = 9.01, p < 0.001. While controlling for age and race, greater perceived economic hardship contributed to higher symptom distress (beta = 0.36, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.34). Race, health care system distrust and social support did not significantly predict symptom distress. Conclusion: Assessment of perceived financial hardship prior to beginning chemotherapy is critical to identify those patients at risk for greater symptom distress.",
