  "title": "Czech Industrial Real Estate Market: The Quest for Realistic Model",
  "abstract": "The study presents reconstruction of the Czech industrial real estate market model by using expert data applied along the Fischer-Di PasqualeWheaton model. Research shows that literature focuses on office, retail, and residential markets, while industrial real estate sector is being completely overlooked. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine linear regression functions of supply and demand at the space market and of industrial portfolio value at the capital market. The paper concludes that the analysis provided a realistic model which can be used for predictions of shifts in industrial property values. Analysis of the industrial real estate market shall continue to allow adoption of the ongoing structural changes connected to e-commerce, shared economy, and industry 4.0. Productivity of space and behavior on the space market are identified as key subjects of further examination within the economics of space and time.",
