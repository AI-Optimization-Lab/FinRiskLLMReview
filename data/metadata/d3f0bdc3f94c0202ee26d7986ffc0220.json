  "title": "Market and business-related key factors supporting the use of compostable bioplastics in the apparel industry: A cross-sector analysis",
  "abstract": "Bioplastics have a high potential to replace conventional and less environmentally friendly plastics. A transition is already well approached in some sectors, such as food packaging. The literature often reports that apparel made from compostable bioplastics could be used in a circular way. To date, such clothes are still rare, although model theory often points to added value from more sustainable clothing. This study investigates whether the textile, food and technics industries see success for bioplastics differently in market and company conditions. Subsequently, it clarifies whether apparel manufacturers should pursue the plastics transition cooperatively with their retailers for better market access, or whether they should align their supply chain with the food or technics sectors ahead in transition. For this, German expert opinions from a cross-sector survey (n = 100) were differentiated by means of portfolio analysis, where the industries are positioned in a McKinsey matrix based on regression models. Regarding resources for a plastic change, the textile industry is only little behind the food sector. However, the market potential is estimated to be similarly moderate as in the technics branch. Obviously, pull effects are still insufficiently pronounced in the fashion market today. Hence, apparel suppliers should cooperatively enhance sales with their retailers providing better market access. Since company factors are less advanced in the technics industry, textile producers should rather follow the food sector when furtherly adopting their supply chain, which might promise cooperation gains then.
