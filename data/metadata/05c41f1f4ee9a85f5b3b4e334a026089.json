  "title": "Prevalence of toothache in Chinese adults aged 65 years and above",
  "abstract": "Objectives To investigate the prevalence of toothache and its risk indicators in the older Chinese population. Methods National cross-sectional survey data on 25 048 Chinese people >= 65 years in 2011, 2014 and 2018 survey year were analysed and then pooled. Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in prevalence among specific subgroups. Multivariate modified Poisson regression analyses with robust error variances were used to detect related factors and prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated. Results The prevalence of toothache was 16.3% (95% CI: 15.5%-17.1%), 12.8% (95% CI: 12.0%-13.7%) and 16.0% (95% CI: 15.3%-16.7%) in years 2011, 2014 and 2018. In the pooled multivariate Poisson regression model, factors associated with toothache were female (PR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.18-1.37), younger age (PR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.63-2.09), currently married and living with spouse (PR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15), current living in urban area (PR:1.12, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20), enough financial support (PR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.65-0.74), having chronic disease (PR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.57), higher sugar intake (PR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17), salty flavour (PR:1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23), smoking (PR: 1.14, 95% CI:1.06-1.23) or drinking (PR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.25), with denture (PR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.22) and higher toothbrushing frequency (PR: 1.25-1.50). Conclusions More than one in ten older Chinese population had toothache, and it was related to age, gender, socioeconomic status, behaviour and oral health status. Lifestyle interventions should be taken to avoid the occurrence of the toothache.",
