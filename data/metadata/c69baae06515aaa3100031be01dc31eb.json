  "title": "The Study on the Credit Risk Assessment of Borrower in P2P Network of China",
  "abstract": "On account of the rapid development of modern network technology, more and more online financial services come to being. Take P2P network as an example. Now, such financial services model in our country is taking great risk. This is mainly a study on credit risk. Based on BP neural network, P2P network platform credit risk evaluation model were built to train and simulate. The results show that the final data generated by these models are of practical value. It is capable of using P2P network platform on personal credit risk evaluation scientifically. At the end of the article, some valuable suggestions are put forward in regard to P2P network loan personal credit risk evaluation system.",
