  "title": "Innovative Mechanism of Rural Finance: Risk Assessment Methods and Impact Factors of Agricultural Loans Based on Personal Emotion and Artificial Intelligence",
  "abstract": "Agricultural finance is in an embarrassing position in the current financial environment, especially during the process of COVID-19. Based on a small-scale peasant economy, it can no longer meet the rapidly rising demand of farmers for agricultural finance. Moreover, there has been a serious disconnection between the financial system of secondary and tertiary industries, and the quality of development needs to be improved urgently. The agricultural loan risk assessment has always been the main problem that we pay great attention to in the innovation of agricultural finance. Agricultural loans are an indispensable element in supporting agricultural development and promoting rural revitalization strategy. However, financial institutions have certain credit risks in reviewing and issuing agricultural loans. This article studies the speech emotion recognition of farmers in loan review to assess loan risk. As for emotional confusion caused by speech segmentation, a special method of data connection between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Networks is designed, and a variable-length speech emotion recognition model including CNN and Bi-LSTM is designed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the risk assessment of farmers in loan review.",
