  "title": "Breast Cancer Incidence among Female Workers by Different Occupations and Industries: A Longitudinal Population-Based Matched Case-Control Study in Taiwan",
  "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence worldwide and in Taiwan. The relationship between breast cancer and occupational types remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate lifetime breast cancer incidence by different occupational industries among female workers in Taiwan. Methods: A population-based retrospective case-control study was conducted using three nationwide population-based databases. Matched case and control groups were identified with 1-to-4 exact matching among 103,047 female workers with breast cancer diagnosed in 2008-2017 and those without breast cancer. Their lifetime labor enrollment records were tracked using the National Labor Insurance Database, 1950-2017. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the association between types of occupational industries and risk of incident breast cancer. Results: Our study found slightly significant breast cancer risk among the following major occupational classifications: manufacturing (OR: 1.027, 95% CI: 1.011-1.043); wholesale and retail trade (OR: 1.068, 95% CI: 1.052-1.084); information and communication (OR: 1.074, 95% CI: 1.043-1.105); financial and insurance activities (OR: 1.109, 95% CI: 1.086-1.133); real estate activities (OR: 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016-1.085); professional, scientific, and technical activities (OR: 1.118, 95% CI: 1.091-1.145); public administration, defense, and social security (OR: 1.054, 95% CI: 1.023-1.087), education (OR: 1.199, 95% CI: 1.168-1.230); and human health and social work activities (OR: 1.125, 95% CI: 1.096-1.156). Conclusions: Greater percentages of industrial occupations (i.e., manufacturing, wholesale and retail, or health professionals) were associated with slightly increased breast cancer risk. Further studies should investigate the possible risk factors among female workers in those industries with slightly higher incidence of breast cancer.",
