  "title": "Estimation of Improved BEKK Model and Its Application in Investment Portfolio",
  "abstract": "When data sets are large, it is difficult to estimate the BEKK model because of the influence of data dimensionality and noise. To address this deficiency of the BEKK model, we apply the modified Cholesky decomposition and a penalty function to the estimation of the BEKK model, and propose an Improved BEKK (IMP-BEKK) model. The IMP-BEKK model first transforms the problem of estimating a complex covariance matrix into a series of regression models by using the modified Cholesky decomposition, and then solves the problem of the dimensionality curse by introducing a penalty function. Through simulation and empirical testing, it is found that the IMP-BEKK model significantly improves the efficiency of estimation and prediction of large matrices, allowing investors to obtain higher returns and economic benefits when the IMP-BEKK model is applied to a portfolio.",
