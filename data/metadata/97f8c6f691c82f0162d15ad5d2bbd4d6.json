  "title": "THE APPLICATION OF ADDITIVE MODEL IN PREDICTING THE RISK OF BANKRUPTCY",
  "abstract": "In this paper the following research problem was addressed: Is DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method a suitable alternative to prediction models in predicting the risk of bankruptcy? In relation to research problem the aim of the paper was formulated: To use DEA method in predicting the risk of bankruptcy and compare its results with the results of selected prediction models. The research was carried out on a sample of 343 businesses operating in Slovak heat industry. To fulfil the aim we applied additive DEA model. We chose this model because of negative values of financial indicators. We compared the results of additive DEA model with the results of Altman model, Virag-Hajdu logit model and Zmijew ski probit model. We found out that according to prediction models, 161 businesses from the analyzed sample are threatened with bankruptcy. The important conclusion of this paper is that additive model allows us to classify businesses into larger amount of scales than prediction models and therefore the classification is more precise.",
