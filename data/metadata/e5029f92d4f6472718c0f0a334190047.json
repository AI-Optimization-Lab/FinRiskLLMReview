  "title": "UnMute Toolkit: Speech Interactions Designed With Minoritised Language Speakers",
  "abstract": "In this paper and interactive exhibit we demonstrate a portfolio of systems and approaches that progressively vary on the theme of co-creating and situating spoken-language technologies to suit the needs, functions, and ways of speaking of diverse, resource-constrained, and under-heard language communities in South Africa and India. These systems demonstrate the benefits of human-centred machine learning methodologies and showcase how language technologies and conversational systems can broaden digital participation of minoritised language communities.",
