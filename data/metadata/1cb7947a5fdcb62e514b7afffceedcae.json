  "title": "Generic-based Wear debris identification - The first step towards morphological classification",
  "abstract": "By combining modern software packages, the means for identifying and 'labelling' wear debris produced under controlled laboratory wear test conditions has been established in conjunction with a new, generic-based wear particle data-base. Abrasive, adhesive and pitting fatigue. modes of wear and failure have been investigated to establish a fully documented portfolio of particle images whose origins and manifestations are formally identified and catalogued. The implications for establishing a wear particle classification methodology are discussed in relation to the current and future requirements of the RAF for monitoring the wear state of engine and gearbox systems.",
