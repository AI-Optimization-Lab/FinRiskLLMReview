  "title": "Risk management in exploration drilling",
  "abstract": "In late 1997, BP Amoco realized that a step change in drilling performance, including health, safety, and environment (HSE) performance, was necessary to sustain the future of the Norwegian operation. A review determined which factors contributed to successful exploration drilling projects. A detailed planning process was developed and underpinned by a set of Ten Principles. Identifying, understanding, and managing the HSE and financial risks involved in an operation are vital to achieve world-class levels of performance. A key feature is how risk assessment is integrated seamlessly into the project workflow.",
