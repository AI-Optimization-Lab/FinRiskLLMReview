  "title": "Risk factors for dementia in highly educated elderly people in Tianjin, China",
  "abstract": "Background: Low education level has been thought an important and specific risk factor for dementia. Therefore, we surveyed dementia in a highly educated population in Tianjin, China. Methods: In total, 1324 old people (aged 55 years and over) in three cluster samples from university communities in Tianjin responded to our survey. Data from psychological tests and dementia questionnaires were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) was 4.98%, 2.11%, and 2.27%, respectively. A history of stroke (OR = 6.036), lack of fruit (OR = 5.489), early parental death (OR = 3.102), household financial management (OR = 2.638), a history of cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.434), a history of hypertension (OR = 2.042), physical exercise (OR = 2.556), were significantly associated with dementia in a single-factor analysis. Four independent variables were entered in a regression equation: early parental death (OR = 6.417), lack of fruit in the diet (OR = 3.919), personal stroke history (OR = 3.901), and lack of physical exercise (OR = 2.220). Conclusion: The prevalence of dementia was lower in highly educated elderly people in universities in Tianjin than in the general population. Risk factors for dementia included disease history, living habits, and early parental death, so corresponding interventions are required. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
