  "title": "The Importance of Regions on Debt Networks",
  "abstract": "This paper researches the important regions identification on real-world debt networks via epidemic dynamic model. The authors observe that regions with lower betweenness centrality and higher clustering coefficient are unstable on the networks from the perspective of network topology. Moreover, excessive debt is not the only reason of the risk infection. Network topological structure is also a significant factor. The findings can deepen the understanding of the spread process of risk in real financial systems.",
