  "title": "Sexual debut and risk behaviors among orphaned and vulnerable children in Zambia: which protective deficits shape HIV risk?",
  "abstract": "Orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) are not only affected by, but also rendered at-risk of, HIV due to overlapping deficits in protective assets, from school to household financial security. Drawing from a protective deficit framework, this study examines correlates of sexual risk - including multiple sexual partnerships, unprotected sex, and age at sexual debut - among OVC aged 13-17 years in Zambia. In May-October 2016, a two-stage stratified random sampling design was used to recruit OVC and their adult caregivers (N = 2,034) in four provinces. OVC-caregiver dyads completed a structured interview addressing household characteristics, protective assets (i.e. finances, schooling, and nutrition), and general health and wellbeing. Associations of factors derived from the multi-component protective deficits framework were examined using multivariable ordered logistic regression, comparing sexually inexperienced OVC to those with a sexual debut and reporting >= 1 sexual behavior(s). A sub-analysis of older (ages 15-17) OVC identified correlates of early (before age 15) and later (at or after age 15) sexual debut using multinomial logistic regression. Among 735 OVC aged 13-17, 14% reported a sexual debut, among whom 14% and 22% reported 2+ past-year partners and non-condom last sex, respectively. Older age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 2.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.32-3.27), male sex (aOR = 1.90, CI 1.22-2.96), not having a birth certificate (aOR = 2.05, CI 1.03-4.09), out-of-school status (aOR = 2.63, CI 1.66-4.16), and non-household labor (aOR = 1.84, CI 1.01-3.38) were significantly associated with higher sexual risk. Male sex was the only factor significantly associated with early sexual debut in multivariable analysis. Sexual risk-reduction strategies require age- and sex-specific differentiation and should be prioritized for OVC in financially distressed households.",
