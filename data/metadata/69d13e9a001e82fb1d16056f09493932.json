  "title": "Investment Portfolio Trading based on Markov Chain and Fuzzy Logic",
  "abstract": "In the present paper, a trading strategy is proposed for a portfolio composed of shares in the stock exchange. The proposed strategy is based mainly on three blocks: 1) a K - means clustering algorithm is used to determine and learn the internal hidden patterns in the time series of stock market prices, 2) a pattern predictor is performed based on a simple Markov chain, and 3) a fuzzy inference system take the decision to trade based on the estimation. The fuzzy inference system is composed by the rules provided by a expert trader. The performance of the trading algorithm is validated through simulations using real prices of the Mexican stock exchange.",
