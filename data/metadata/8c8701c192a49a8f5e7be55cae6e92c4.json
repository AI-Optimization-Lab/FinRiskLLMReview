  "title": "Lumbopelvic Pain in Pregnancy in a Diverse Urban Patient Population: Prevalence and Risk Factors",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Pregnancy lumbopelvic pain (PLPP) is a common ailment during pregnancy with physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. Prior literature has focused on majority Caucasian patient populations; none have focused on Hispanic populations, especially in the United States.Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of pregnant people who experience PLPP in mostly Hispanic population.Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional survey Setting: Academic medical center Patients: All pregnant people attending a prenatal visit in obstetrical offices from July 2018 through March 2020 were asked to complete a questionnaire compiling demographic, socioeconomic information as well as describe any pain symptoms. Furthermore, the Pregnancy Mobility Index (PMI), Pelvic Girdle Pain Questionnaire (PGQ), and the Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID) were included.Results: In a cohort (n = 851) that was 62% Hispanic, we found a 63% point-prevalence rate for PLPP. Pregnant people who reported PLPP were further along in their pregnancy, did have significantly higher scores for the PMI and PGQ, indicating a greater level of disability, and reported issues with incontinence (QUID). Results of the logistic regression found that a higher PMI score and financial instability were factors influencing PLPP.Conclusions: In a cohort of majority Hispanic people, we found that 63% of respondents had PLPP. Our study found that a higher PMI score and financial instability were factors influencing PLPP. Clinicians should be alert to pregnant people who express their difficulties with activities of daily living as they may be at risk of PLPP, and could benefit from further evaluation and treatment.",
