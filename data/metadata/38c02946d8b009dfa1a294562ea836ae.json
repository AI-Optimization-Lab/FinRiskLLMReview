  "title": "Integrated production of whey protein concentrate and lactose derivatives: What is the best combination?",
  "abstract": "In order to model and analyze the techno-economic feasibility of a whey processing unit for the production of whey protein concentrate (WPC) integrated with processing of lactose, the present study utilized the software SuperPro Designer (R) for modeling of the processes, including risk analysis and study of reduced pollution impacts. Six models were constructed for the production of WPC and processing of lactose, which were (1) WPC 34, (2) WPC 34 and lactose powder, (3) WPC 34 and hydrous ethanol fuel, (4) WPC 80, (5) WPC 80 and lactose powder, and (6) WPC 80 and hydrous ethanol fuel. The economic evaluation was performed by analysis of the Payback Period (PP), Net Present Value (NPV), Breakeven Point (BP) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Probability distributions obtained by fitting of historical data for whey prices and the final products were used to perform the risk analysis, submitted to a Monte Carlo simulation using the (R) Risk software. The project showed to be feasible due to the elevated IRR and NPV values, coupled with low BP and PP. When evaluating the individual production of ethanol, it was verified that the production cost of this product was superior to the sale price, making independent production of ethanol from lactose present in the whey uneconomical. Plants with production of lactose powder were more economically attractive and also presented greater reduction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOO) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). The financial indices suggested greater feasibility of WPC 80 compared to WPC 34. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
