  "title": "The systematic-risk determinants of the China logistics industry",
  "abstract": "Since the foundation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), many empirical research has been conducted to investigate firm-specific variables as they relate to systematic risk. This paper samples China's 33 listed logisticss companies for the period of 1997-2005 and uses multivariate regression to analyze the relationships between systematic risk and seven financial variables. It turns out that operating efficiency and profitability are negatively associated with the systematic risk, while liquidity, debt leverage, firm size, and growth are not found significantly related to the systematic risk. A paradoxical finding about the relationship between operating leverage and systematic risk has also been found opposed to the relevant finance theory.",
