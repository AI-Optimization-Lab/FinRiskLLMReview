  "title": "Applied Research on Macro Stress-testing in the Credit Risk Management for China's Commercial Banks",
  "abstract": "Macro stress-testing approach is widely used to assess and manage credit risk of commercial banks by international financial institutions, however, it is still at the initial stage with few researches in China. In order to measure credit risk in China's commercial banks, the paper builds a relationship between the credit risk of China's commercial banks and the macro economical factors by using SUR(Seemingly Unrelated Regression) and run the macro stress-testing. The empirical results show that, at the present, China's commercial banks don't have strong ability to defense credit risks, and the bank system is not stable enough.",
