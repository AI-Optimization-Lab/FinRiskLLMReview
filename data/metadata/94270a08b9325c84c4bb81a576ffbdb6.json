  "title": "The credit card market of China under the financial crisis",
  "abstract": "In the current financial crisis sweeping the world, each country's financial market has been got a huge impact, which also includes the credit card market. However, relatively independent Chinese credit card market has experienced a good development. Credit card, as a global common modern form of currency in China is ushering in a new era. But the card is a high-risk, high-yield industry. China's credit card market has just begun, which has broad prospects for development and profitability of space, but also tremendous risks.
