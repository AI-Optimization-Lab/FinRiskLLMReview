  "title": "Threat Assessment for Android Environment with Connectivity to IoT Devices from the Perspective of Situational Awareness",
  "abstract": "As smartphones such as mobile devices become popular, malicious attackers are choosing them as targets. The risk of attack is steadily increasing as most people store various personal information such as messages, contacts, and financial information on their smartphones. Particularly, the vulnerabilities of the installed operating systems (e.g., Android, iOS, etc.) are trading at a high price in the black market. In addition, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has created a hyperconnected society in which various devices are connected to one network. Therefore, the safety of the smartphone is becoming an important factor to remotely control these technologies. A typical attack method that threatens the security of such a smartphone is a method of inducing installation of a malicious application. However, most studies focus on the detection of malicious applications. This study suggests a method to evaluate threats to be installed in the Android OS environment in conjunction with machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present future direction from the cyber threat intelligence perspective and situational awareness, which are the recent issues.",
