  "title": "Analysis of linkage effects among industry sectors in China's stock market before and after the financial crisis",
  "abstract": "This paper uses two physics-derived techniques, the minimum spanning tree and the hierarchical tree, to investigate the networks formed by CITIC (China International Trust and Investment Corporation) industry indices in three periods from 2006 to 2013. The study demonstrates that obvious industry clustering effects exist in the networks, and Durable Consumer Goods, Industrial Products, Information Technology, Frequently Consumption and Financial Industry are the core nodes in the networks. We also use the rolling window technique to investigate the dynamic evolution of the networks' stability, by calculating the mean correlations and mean distances, as well as the variance of correlations and the distances of these indices. China's stock market is still immature and subject to administrative interventions. Therefore, through this analysis, regulators can focus on monitoring the core nodes to ensure the overall stability of the entire market, while investors can enhance their portfolio allocations or investment decision-making.
