  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of institutional variables, risks, and dependence on the voluntary application of international financial reporting standards. The study used a quantitative research method based on regression analysis, with data obtained from a survey from among Vietnam's small and medium businesses. The findings confirmed that legitimacy, dependence, consistency, time, international trade, uncertainty, operational risk, financial risk, and industry all have a positive impact on the ability to voluntary application international financial reporting standards, with the exception of flexibility, which has a negative impact. The findings of the study have consequences for stakeholders in making proper policy decisions about the application of the International Financial Reporting Standards.",
