  "title": "CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE OPERATIONAL RISK IN COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS",
  "abstract": "This paper aims to present how to quantify the minimum capital requirement for operational risk using three approaches proposed by the Basel Committee to identify how optimal allocation of capital, given that until recently this risk has been allocated a minimum attention, considering that it has a low impact on the business of financial institutions. In many cases operational risks tend to be underestimated, considering that the losses they cause, are generally minor can't threatening the survival of a bank. Losses resulting from these events come from a complex interaction between organizational factors, personal and market that do not fit into a simple classification scheme. Observing what happened in the past we can say that operational risk is an important question of the financial losses in the banking sector.",
