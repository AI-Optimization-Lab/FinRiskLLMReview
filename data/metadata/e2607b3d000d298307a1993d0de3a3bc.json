  "abstract": "In this paper, a kind of improved k-clustering stock-picking method is adopted to cluster the 300 indexes of the csi 300 indexes, and investigate the average yield of all kinds, and select the class with the highest average rate of return to be held as our portfolio, thus achieving the excess return. The empirical evidence shows that, using the strategy of this paper to select the stocks and roll it, the excess accumulated yield of the portfolio is better than that of the csi 300.",
