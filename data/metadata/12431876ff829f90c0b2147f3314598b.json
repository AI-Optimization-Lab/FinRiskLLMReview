  "abstract": "This research aims to analyze and investigate the role of brand in keeping and increasing the buying portfolio of customers. In this respect, three hypotheses have been developed. In carrying out this research after exploration of models and approaches in brand, questionnaire was used for customers of the company, Pars Rayehe Saz. Based on the hypotheses of the research, a questionnaire form consisting of 24 questions was made, and statistical population was enveloped as company's customers in the first months of the year that was available for the company. Then, this questionnaire form was delivered and gathered after filling. Result was analyzed by SPSS software and all hypotheses examined and the final result was in line with all three hypotheses. It means there is a significant relationship between purchase decision-making and loyalty oriented decision-making (first hypothesis). There is a significant relationship between product quality and future supposed brand extended product quality perceived by customers (second hypothesis). There is a significant relationship between product proportion and future supposed brand extended product proportion perceived by customers (third hypothesis). Statistical population for this research is limited to customers of the first several months of the year that was available for the company to send and receive questionnaire form; the research hypotheses were tested by correlation test. Sign test and simple regression and all the hypotheses were verified. Finally, based on the above three hypothesis, it was concluded that there is a relationship between customers and brand, and it means by using brand, customers would be kept and their purchase basket would increase.",
