  "title": "Pricing American interest rate options under the jump-extended constant-elasticity-of-variance short rate models",
  "abstract": "This paper demonstrates how to value American interest rate options under the jump-extended constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) models. We consider both exponential jumps (see Duffle et al., 2000) and log-normal jumps (see Johannes, 2004) in the short rate process. We show how to superimpose recombining multinomial jump trees on the diffusion trees, creating mixed jump-diffusion trees for the CEV models of short rate extended with exponential and lognormal jumps. Our simulations for the special case of jump-extended Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) square root model show a significant computational advantage over the Longstaff and Schwartz's (2001) least-squares regression method (ISM) for pricing American options on zero-coupon bonds.
