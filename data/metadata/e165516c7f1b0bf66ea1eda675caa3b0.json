  "title": "Optimal trading of ETFs: Spreadsheet prototypes and applications to client-server applications",
  "abstract": "This paper presents an application of an Excel spreadsheet-development methodology used by quantitative analysts and traders in financial markets. The spreadsheet used regression and Excel's Solver to determine the optimal investment of a firm's risk capital. The proprietary methodology used to develop real-time trading tools and its repetitive design structure allowed the firm to become a market-maker exchange traded fund (ETF) rapidly. By adhering to the methodology, the firm's documentation of user requirements, data inputs, calculations, and user interfaces, and a full prototype using Excel, made incremental growth possible and provided a solid foundation for conversion into coded software. Rapid development gave the firm the opportunity to derive revenue from market-making activities in new investment products; these would become a major source of revenue. This methodology, which the authors presented in 2001 at the International Conference on Software Quality in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its implementation led to the development of a complete trading-system development methodology.",
