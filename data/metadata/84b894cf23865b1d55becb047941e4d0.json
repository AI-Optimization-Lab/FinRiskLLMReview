  "title": "A Study on the Future Trend of Chinese Art Education and Art Industry Development",
  "abstract": "This paper shows the relationship between Chinese art education, art industry and economic development during the past 14 years and forecasts the trend for the next five years starting from 2016 to 2020. The linear regression model results show that, the number of arts education institution and economic development declined in the past 14 years due to the declining trend of the number of arts education institutions. However, the forecasting shows a positive and promising future due to the fact that the number of employees in art education, and the number of art institutions and the number of employees in the art industry are showing a forward distribution trend. It is recommended that special policy, more investment portfolio and attention should be given to the art industry in China.",
