  "abstract": "Stock market analysis and forecasting is one of the most sought-after areas of study. As anyone who has observed stock market movements, even an outsider, knows very well the enormous amount of risk involved, with numerous factors affecting it, its study is quite intriguing and interesting, let alone a profitable one. So, it is imperative we look for prediction tools to help us through the process. As we dwell into already available tools in the fields of economics and statistics, we can sense a need of innovation from other evolving domains and the immediate one is the field of machine learning. This paper is a stock market price forecasting one, using neural network model, employed on financial data concerning pre- and post-mergers of companies. We have collected data of pre-merger and post-merger states, formed a neural network model to fit it and used the model to forecast. The predictions were reasonably accurate.",
