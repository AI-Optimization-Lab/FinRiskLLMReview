  "title": "Pressure ulcers: an overview",
  "abstract": "This article gives a general overview of pressure ulcers, with a focus on secondary care. Pressure ulcers are damage to the skin or underlying tissue as a result of pressure, friction or shearing forces. They place a significant physical, psychological and financial burden on patients and healthcare systems which will be explored. This review also covers risk assessment, classification and management of pressure ulcers in the inpatient setting.",
