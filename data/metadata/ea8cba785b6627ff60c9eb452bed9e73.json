  "title": "PASS: Portfolio Analysis of Selecting Strategies on quantitative trading via NSGA-II",
  "abstract": "Quantitative trading, driven by technological advancements, utilizes machine learning and mathematical models to develop trading strategies. Evaluating strategy performance through backtesting is common, but ensuring sufficient funding and stability is crucial. Portfolio construction mitigates risk and promotes sustained profit growth. This article introduces the portfolio analysis of selecting strategies (PASS) model, integrating a stability indicator, 'drawdown duration' (DDD) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Results demonstrate that PASS reduces DDD risk by 73.9% and increases profit by 4.1% compared to other MOEAs. The model is applied successfully to trading markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the Mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM), aiding investors in crafting profitable strategies and managing risk in leveraged trades.",
