  "title": "Age and gender differences in financial distress among hematopoietic cell transplant survivors",
  "abstract": "Purpose Cancer has long-term financial consequences. Adolescent and young adult (AYA) and middle-aged cancer survivors may experience more financial toxicity than older adults. This study examined age differences in financial distress in hematopoietic cell transplant survivors and whether these differences result from measurement bias, more financial barriers to care, or an overall higher level of distress. Methods Hematologic malignancy survivors (n = 1135, 2-10 years post-transplant) completed the Cancer and Treatment Distress Scale (CTXD) and demographics as part of the baseline assessment for a randomized clinical trial. The CTXD has seven subscales, but for this study, we examined the financial distress subscale and the overall score. Item response theory analyses tested for bias by age and gender. Multivariate linear regression tested the association of age and gender with the CTXD scores while controlling for financial barriers to care. Results No bias was found on the CTXD. AYA (p < 0.01) and middle-aged adults (p < 0.001) reported more financial and overall distress than older (age 65+) adults. The same association of age and financial distress was observed in women (p < 0.01). However, only middle-aged men (p < 0.01) reported more financial and overall distress than older men; AYA men did not (p > 0.18). Financial barriers to care were not associated with financial or overall distress. Conclusions Part of the increase in financial distress with younger age may be due to a higher risk of general distress. Policy initiatives to control cancer costs should consider life stage and the unique financial challenges at different ages for men and women.",
