  "title": "Human health and other risk drivers to prioritize site remediation",
  "abstract": "Remedial actions at soil and groundwater cleanup sites have traditionally been addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis, as needed to address regulatory requirements. However, effective management of large portfolios of remediation sites (such as hundreds or thousands of UST sites owned by a single company) requires coordination and prioritization of individual site response actions to optimize the degree of risk reduction achieved with available resources. To meet these management objectives, two new risk-based management tools have been developed and implemented by the authors: i) a simple risk-based classification system, that can be employed to prioritize response actions, identify key risk drivers, and measure risk reduction progress over time for the full site portfolio; and ii) a lifecycle cost management system that can be employed to forecast remediation spending and optimize risk reduction benefits. For use in prioritizing response actions at remediation sites, risk is defined as the negative consequence of no action. In this context, sites may be classified in terms of key risk drivers, including both potential health and environmental impacts (primary risk drivers), as well as regulatory, community, off-site property, and transactional concerns (secondary risk drivers). Individual site classifications, based on the Class 1 through 4 designation presented in the ASTM RBCA Standard, can be compiled to establish a risk distribution for the full remediation site portfolio. These data are then be used to identify near-term, high-risk sites; define the key risk drivers for the portfolio; and, by periodically repeating the classification survey, track the progress of remediation efforts in reducing total portfolio risk over time. This risk-based site prioritization system has been applied to a portfolio of over 1500 petroleum release sites in the U.S. Results of this study show that about 70% of these sites pose no threat of impact on human or ecological receptors in the near-term (i.e., 2 years). Rather, remediation decisions at these sites were driven by secondary risk drivers (i.e., regulatory requirements or transactional issues), which do not represent health or environmental protection imperatives. In addition lifecycle cost projections were compiled for this same site population and used to identify regional variations in average remediation costs attributable to differences in management approach or regulatory requirements. The cost data can be combined with the risk classification data to identify cost control opportunities at sites where secondary risk factors are driving the site remediation.",
