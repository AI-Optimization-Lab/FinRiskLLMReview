  "title": "Internal Control Model of Enterprise Financial Management Based on Market Economy Environment",
  "abstract": "In order to better solve the problems existing in the internal environment, risk assessment, and internal supervision of enterprise financial management, this paper proposes a method of enterprise financial analysis and control model based on artificial neural network algorithm. The results show that, through the internal control model and management optimization of financial management, a large number of calculations and subjective affairs in the process of financial work can be avoided to the greatest extent. For enterprises, a large number of human, material, and financial resources can be saved for data collection, which is more conducive to improving the enterprise financial management system, improving the quality of financial information, providing technical support for enterprise decision-making, and further reducing the risk in the process of enterprise operation.",
