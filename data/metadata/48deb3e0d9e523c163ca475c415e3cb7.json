  "title": "The lower regression function and testing expectation dependence dominance hypotheses",
  "abstract": "We provide an estimator of the lower regression function and provide large sample properties for inference. We also propose a test of the hypothesis of positive expectation dependence and derive its limiting distribution under the null hypothesis and provide consistent critical values. We apply our methodology to the question of portfolio choice and to the question of the relation of growth to public debt.",
