  "title": "Clinical Factors to Investigate Survival Analysis in Cardiovascular Patients",
  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide; however, the management of patients with this pathology within hospital facilities has not been uniquely realized. Through appropriate statistical methods (i.e., survival analysis, Cox regression, and logistic regression), we have tried to illuminate the survival and length of stay of patients with cardiovascular diseases in hospitals. The results obtained classify the clinical factors into risk variables (which reduce survival) and protective variables (which prolong survival) and are linked to the long stay of this particular category of patients. The aim of this work is to analyze the variables responsible for long stays in patients with cardiovascular diseases to monitor the health of patients and better manage the financial resources of health facilities in relation to this problem.",
