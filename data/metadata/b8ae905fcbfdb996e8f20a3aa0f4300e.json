  "title": "Data-driven Demand Response Characterization and Quantification",
  "abstract": "Analysis of load behavior in demand response (DR) schemes is important to evaluate the performance of participants. Very few real-world experiments have been carried out and quantification and characterization of the response is a difficult task. Nevertheless it will be a necessary tool for portfolio management of consumers in a DR framework. In this paper we develop methods to quantify and characterize the amount of DR in a load. The contribution to the aggregated load from each household is quantified on a daily basis, showing the potential variability of the response in time. Clustering on the average values and standard deviation of the contribution regroups households with the same average response. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to characterize different DR delivery profiles.",
