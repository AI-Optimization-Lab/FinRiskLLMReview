  "title": "Reexamining the poverty cycle in middle and late adulthood: Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study 2002-2014",
  "abstract": "This study re-examined the poverty cycle among American middle-aged (45 similar to 64) and older (>= 65) adults using contemporary data and has expanded the understanding of sociodemographic differences in the poverty cycle. Longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (2002-2014) were used. Life tables examined age-specific and cumulative percentages of poverty. Mixed-effect logistic regression models examined the moderation role of sociodemographic characteristics in the relationship between age and poverty. The poverty proportion increased rapidly starting at age 75. The growth rate of poverty risk in late adulthood was found to be greater among women and those who did not receive public pensions. Gender divides in poverty risk in late adulthood could be attributed to the cumulative disadvantages of women's social roles. The beneficial role of Social Security in late adulthood was supported. Policy advocacy efforts should address the needs of those who are financially vulnerable. Policy options such as financial education and retirement planning were recommended.",
