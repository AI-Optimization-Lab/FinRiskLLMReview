  "abstract": "Financial markets can be modeled as complex systems. The Hugh quantity and different information affecting these markets is a remarked characteristic. However some of this information can be recovered by constructing a topology of the market. We develop a symbolic method in order to study relationships in the financial markets by constructing a minimal spanning tree (MST) and a hierarchical tree (HT). The method is successfully applied to the Italian financial market, detecting clusters with economic sense. This classification is helpful in portfolio construction and studying industrial networks.",
