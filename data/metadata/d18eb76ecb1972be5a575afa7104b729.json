  "title": "Pricing American-style options by Monte Carlo simulation: alternatives to ordinary least squares",
  "abstract": "We investigate the performance of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method in Monte Carlo simulation algorithms for pricing American options. We compare OLS regression against several alternatives and find that OLS regression underperforms methods that penalize the size of coefficient estimates when the number of simulation paths is small. Based on our findings, we recommend an alternative method based on a modification of the matching projection pursuit that we introduce in this paper.",
