  "title": "Parametric hypothesis testing in evaluation of expected shortfall models",
  "abstract": "Introduced on the turn of 21st century, the axiomatic risk theory has developed around the notion of a coherent risk measure. In recent literature much attention has been given to the ES (expected shortfall) measure, which fulfils the set of coherency axioms and offers an important extension to the VaR model. As the relevant distribution is unknown, statistical evaluation of the ES model cannot use the natural measure of discrepancy between estimated and empirical ES. Instead hypothesis testing uses the regression approach, the saddlepoint technique or the goodness of fit of the truncated return density. The study presents parametric methods of statistical inference connected with ES measure and, through the simulation study, gives the comparison of the size and power of the considered tests. In order to reflect the stylized facts about real financial processes, simulation experiments are based on the GARCH processes. The power evaluation includes both homoscedastic and heteroskedastic models with incorrect variance parameters.",
