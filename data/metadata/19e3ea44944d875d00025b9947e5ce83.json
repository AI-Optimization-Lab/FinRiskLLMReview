  "title": "Can Mixed-Frequency Data Improve the Higher-Order Moments Portfolio Performance?",
  "abstract": "In the presence of non-normally distributed asset returns, an optimal portfolio selection should consider higher-order (co-)moments when no sampling errors exist. However, the curse of dimensionality has already been a serious concern in mean-variance analyses; higher-order (co-)moments also face the same dilemma. This study uses mixed-frequency (MF) data under the assumption that stock returns are generated by a mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regression model, which shows to provide well-improved estimates for the covariance, co-skewness, and co-kurtosis matrices for higher dimension. We discover that the new, improved estimates used in higher-order (co-)moment portfolio selections can dominate the other existing structured estimates from an out-of-sample perspective in most instances.",
