  "title": "A Snapshot of Social Risk Factors and Associations with Health Outcomes in a Community Sample of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) People in the US",
  "abstract": "Social factors (e.g. housing, food security, etc.) contribute significantly to health. The purpose of this study is to describe social risk and social exclusion factors in one of the largest Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) populations in the U.S. and their association with health outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study with a community convenience sample of 412 adults who self-identify as MENA. Weighted, adjusted linear regression models were used to examine relationships of interest. Prevalent social risks included transportation barriers to healthcare (33%), food insecurity (33%), and financial strain (25%). In adjusted models, perception of being treated unfairly (Estimate (SE) 0.08 (0.04), p < 0.05) and fear of deportation (0.26 (0.06), p < 0.001) were associated with more social risk factors. More social risk factors were associated with worse self-reported health (0.09 (0.03), p < 0.01), more chronic conditions (0.11 (0.03), p < 0.004), and more mental health symptoms (0.34 (0.14) p < 0.01).Social risk is high among those perceiving unfairness and fear deportation. Those with more social risk factors reported worse health. These findings have implications for social needs screening and referral models that can best serve U.S. MENA sub-populations.",
