  "title": "A deep learning method for pricing high-dimensional American-style options via state-space partition",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a deep learning approach for solving optimal stopping problems and high-dimensional American-style options pricing problems. Through state-space partition, the method does not require recalculation of the structure of networks when the price of the asset changes, which makes tracking valuation more efficient. This paper also offers theoretical proof for the existence of a deep learning network that can determine the optimal stopping time via state-space partition. We present convergence proofs for the estimators and also test the method on Bermuda max-call options as examples.",
