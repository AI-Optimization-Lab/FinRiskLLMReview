  "title": "THE IMPACT OF CREDIT RISK ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ECUADORIAN CREDIT CO-OPERATIVES SOCIETIES",
  "abstract": "The Savings and Credit Co-Operatives Societies (SCCS) contribute to local and regional growth because, through their credit offer, micro, small and medium entrepreneurs have access to financing that traditional banks limit. However, in the last 10 years, they reduced their number, due to poor financial performance due to not meeting the required profitability, liquidity and solvency indicators. The objective of this research is to analyze the impact of credit risk on the profitability of segment 1 and 2 SCCS in Ecuador, in the period 2015-2018. This research proposes a descriptive and correlational quantitative analysis to demonstrate the relationship between the increase in the past due portfolio with respect to the profitability of co-operatives societies in the afore mentioned segments. Based on the correlational analysis, it is found in the bivariate, that there is a high negative correlation (more than -0.5) between NPL rate and profitability measures. Also, in the regression analysis, a significant negative relationship was found between these variables. The results suggest that SCCS can improve their profitability if credit risk is selected and monitored more efficiently, in order to improve the forecast of future risk levels.",
