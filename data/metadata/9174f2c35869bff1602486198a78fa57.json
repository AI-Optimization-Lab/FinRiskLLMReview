  "title": "An Efficient Risk Data Learning with LSTM RNN",
  "abstract": "The use of big risk data for risk management has evolved into a concern within financial services industry in recent years. Whether the quality of big risk data can be relied upon is to be ascertained till 2019. To facilitate the measurement and prediction of data quality, we propose an efficient approach to slide a piece of data from the big risk data and a model to train divergent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with various algorithms. The network is evaluated by the improvement in network run time, prediction accuracy and relevant error. This enables financial institutions to identify potential data risks instantly for earlier mitigation soon.",
