  "title": "The derivatives debate: do derivatives disclosures add value during difficult times?",
  "abstract": "Purpose - This study investigates whether the disclosure of derivatives is value relevant in emerging markets and evaluates the effects of the 2008/2009 global financial crisis on the value relevance of derivative disclosures. Design/methodology/approach - Panel regression models using sub-samples and a crisis interaction term were applied to a sample of the 200 largest non-financial firms by market capitalization listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2005 to 2017 to assess the consequences of the financial crisis. Findings - The results suggest that the disclosure of derivatives is value relevant in the hitherto understudied context of emerging markets. The 2008/2009 financial crisis had a significant impact on derivatives use and the value relevance of derivatives disclosure by JSE-listed companies. Practical implications - Companies should reconsider both how they employ derivatives as part of their risk management practices and how they communicate derivatives use to stakeholders in the financial statements. The findings facilitate a comparative analysis across various market contexts by researchers and assist investors in better decision-making. The findings can influence regulatory practices and can help standard setters to review disclosure requirements. Originality/value - The benefits of corporate hedging were studied from an emerging market perspective, using an original dataset and approach to investigate the effects of international financial volatility on emerging markets. The authors tested whether companies are valued differently, based on their disclosure of the use of derivatives in the financial statements, and the effect of the financial crisis on the value relevance derivatives disclosures.",
