  "title": "An Unmet Need Meets an Untapped Resource: Pharmacist-Led Pathways for Hypertension Management for Emergency Department Patients",
  "abstract": "Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to describe the role of the pharmacist in innovative pathways of care for hypertension (HTN) management for emergency department (ED) patients, particularly in under-resourced communities. Due to intersecting socioeconomic and personal health risk factors, these patients bear a disproportionate share of cardiovascular disease, yet often have limited access to high-quality primary care.Recent FindingsRecent meta-analyses demonstrate a clear advantage associated with pharmacist-physician collaborative models over traditional physician-only care in achieving blood pressure control. However, no prior study has evaluated use of pharmacist-led follow-up for ED patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Thus, we developed a pharmacist-driven transitional care clinic (TCC) that utilizes a collaborative practice agreement with ED physicians to improve HTN management for ED patients. We have successfully implemented the TCC in a high-volume urban ED and in a pilot study have shown clinically relevant BP reductions with our collaborative model.SummaryThe use of pharmacist-led follow-up for HTN management is highly effective. Novel programs such as our TCC, which extend the reach of such a model to ED patients, are promising, and future studies should focus on implementation through larger, multicenter, randomized trials. However, to be most effective, policy advocacy is needed to expand pharmacist prescriptive authority and develop innovative financial models to incentivize this practice.",
