  "title": "Heterogeneous Retirement Savings Strategy Selection with Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Saving and investment behaviour is crucial for all individuals to guarantee their welfare during work-life and retirement. We introduce a deep reinforcement learning model in which agents learn optimal portfolio allocation and saving strategies suitable for their heterogeneous profiles. The environment is calibrated with occupation- and age-dependent income dynamics. The research focuses on heterogeneous income trajectories dependent on agents' profiles and incorporates the parameterisation of agents' behaviours. The model provides a new flexible methodology to estimate lifetime consumption and investment choices for individuals with heterogeneous profiles.",
