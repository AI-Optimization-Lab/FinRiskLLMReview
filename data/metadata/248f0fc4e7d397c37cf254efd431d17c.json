  "title": "Dynamic Prediction Model of Financial Asset Volatility Based on Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Predicting financial market volatility is essential for investors and risk management. This study proposes a dynamic prediction model for financial asset volatility, with a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) utilized to cleverly address market complexity. Our framework integrates Bi-RNN and gated recurrent units (GRU) to perform global optimization via particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Bi-RNN combines historical data and future expectations, while GRU effectively solves long-term dependency issues through a gating mechanism, which enhances model generalization. Experimental results show that the model exhibits significant performance advantages on different financial datasets, along with strong learning and generalization capabilities superior to traditional methods. This research provides advanced and practical solutions for financial asset fluctuation prediction and is of positive significance for the greater accuracy of investment decisions and risk mitigation.",
