  "title": "Reinforcement learning model for optimizing generation bidding strategy with risk management",
  "abstract": "With the special characteristics of electric power market, generation companies must manage the trade risk when optimizing their bidding strategies. This paper presents a two-level optimal bidding strategies model with portfolio management in the electric power market with staircase bidding curve and uniform market clearing mechanism for each trading period. At the high level, a Roth-Erov reinforcement learning method is applied to obtain the bid prices at equilibrium by simulation. Based on the theory of portfolio management, the unit capacity is optimally dispatched based on the mean-variance function at the low level subproblems. The optimal bidding strategy is thus achieved.",
