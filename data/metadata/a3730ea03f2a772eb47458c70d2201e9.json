  "title": "Specialized dental care for people with disabilities in Brazil: profile of the Dental Specialty Centers, 2014",
  "abstract": "Objective: To describe the oral health care services for people with disabilities treated within the Dentistry for Patients with Special Needs (PSN) specialty. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with data from the Program for Improving Access and Quality of Dental Specialty Centers (PMAQ-CEO) in 2014. Results: Of the total of 932 services evaluated, 89.8% did provide care for PSNs, 30.4% had physical accessibility. 59.7% provided referral to hospital care and most guaranteed complete treatment. Only a third of the Dental Specialty Centers planned 40 or more hours a week for prodding clinical care to PSNs. Conclusion: The care network for people with disabilities is being formed but, even with specific financial incentives, it has limitations. Services need to eliminate physical and attitudinal barriers to ensure universal accessibility. Protocols based on risk classification are necessary, prioritizing care at DSCs for complex cases not attended to in Primary Care and organizing the dental health care network fir people with disabilities.",
