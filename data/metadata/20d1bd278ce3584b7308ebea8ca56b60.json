  "title": "Large portfolio allocation based on high-dimensional regression and Kendall's Tau",
  "abstract": "In financial investments, portfolio allocation is always one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks. This paper proposes a robust portfolio optimization approach, extending the application of classical mean-variance (M-VAR) method for high-dimensional situations. The yielded assets return of the proposed method can be enhanced to some extent. It is called Kendall's tau unconstrained shrinkage regression for M-VAR method (KUSR-MV). By some representative empirical studies, it is shown to have a more robust estimation of high-dimensional portfolio allocation compared to its competitors. Besides, its Sharpe ratio can be improved while the risk constraint can be well remained.",
