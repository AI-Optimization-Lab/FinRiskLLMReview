  "title": "Implementing multi-controlled X gates using the quantum Fourier transform",
  "abstract": "Quantum computing has the potential to solve many complex algorithms in the domains of optimization, arithmetics, structural search, financial risk analysis, machine learning, image processing, and others. Quantum circuits built to implement these algorithms usually require multi-controlled gates as fundamental building blocks, where the multi-controlled Toffoli stands out as the primary example. For implementation in quantum hardware, these gates should be decomposed into many elementary gates, which results in a large depth of the final quantum circuit. However, even moderately deep quantum circuits have low fidelity due to decoherence effects and, thus, may return an almost perfectly uniform distribution of the output results. This paper proposes a different approach for efficient cost multi-controlled gates implementation using the quantum Fourier transform. We show how the depth of the circuit can be significantly reduced using only a few ancilla qubits, making our approach viable for application to noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. This quantum arithmetic-based approach can be efficiently used to implement many complex quantum gates.",
