  "title": "Willingness to pay for complementary health insurance in Iran: Contingent valuation approach",
  "abstract": "Background The Iranian health system is based on social health insurance, which is responsible for providing access to basic health care. In addition to basic treatment insurance, complementary health insurance (CHI) offers introductory packages that include surplus services. We recently observed an increase in Iran's health insurance loss coefficient, from 16.5% to 90.4% in 2017. Aim To determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for (CHI). Methods We attempted to determine the WTP for CHI in this study to understand better the potential market and the factors that influence CHI demand. The study surveyed 1023 households in the Kerman Province. A questionnaire developed by the researcher was used in this study, based on the principles of contingent valuation and the bidding game method principles. In each scenario, the factors affecting people's WTP, the demand function, and the effective factors on demand were determined using linear multivariate regression using the ordinary least squares method. Findings The average WTP was $ 7.01, $ 12.57, $ 16.19, and $ 18.73 for the first to fourth scenarios, respectively. The demand elasticity for health insurance increased from the first to the fourth scenario, indicating that demand is expandable. On the other hand, it was observed that risk aversion dictates the demand for CHI. Conclusion Contrary to the insurance claims theory, demand for CHI did not reverse. To this end, insurance fund policymakers can avoid risks and high financial costs by identifying risk-averse individuals.",
