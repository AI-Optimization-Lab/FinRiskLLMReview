  "title": "A comparison of discriminant analysis and neural networks to the classification problem of non-life insurance companies",
  "abstract": "The financial condition of the non-life insurers has increasing received attention for several parties including consumers/insurance buyers, agents and insurers. The number of success and failure of these firms will be affected to public and economic system of the country. It is therefore necessary for stakeholders and policymakers to examine the risk profiles of these companies, which would help to pinpoint warning symptoms of firm's failure beforehand. As such, the main purpose of this research is to compare the use of discriminant analysis and neural networks in classifying the financial distress of non-life insurance companies into solvent and insolvent groups. The validity of two proposed models is measured by the accuracy rate of classifications. The findings suggest that neural networks outperform discriminant analysis in classification procedure.",
