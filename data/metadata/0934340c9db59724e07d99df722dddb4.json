  "title": "Stillbirths in India: Current Status, Challenges, and the Way Forward",
  "abstract": "Stillbirth is a major public health challenge and a multifaceted issue that leads to significant financial, physical, mental, financial, and psychosocial implications. India has made substantial progress in stillbirth reduction. Yet, many challenges continue and the absolute number of stillbirths remain high. This paper presents the national and state level burden of stillbirths and discusses about the magnitude, risk factors, causes and inequities in stillbirths. A few additional approaches for reduction of preventable stillbirths have been suggested. The authors argue that the institutional mechanisms need to be developed to ensure all stillbirths are registered in a timely manner. There is a need for standard definition for classification of stillbirths and document the cause, to roll-out suitable interventions. There is a need for state specific interventions to address different causes, as Indian states have variable stillbirth rates. The stillbirth audits should be institutionalised as a continuous quality improvement exercise to bring local accountability and reduce stillbirth rate. The healthcare system and providers must be trained to offer bereavement support to the affected mothers and families. These approaches should be implemented through primary healthcare system as well.",
