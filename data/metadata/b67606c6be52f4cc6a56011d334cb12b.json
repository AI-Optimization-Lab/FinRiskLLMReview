  "title": "RETURN AND VOLATILITY RELATIONSHIP IN U.S FINANCIAL MARKET: FINANCIAL RISK SPILLOVER IN US EQUITY AND BOND MARKET",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the relationship between volatility and returns in bond and equity markets during the US financial crisis and EU crisis. We use the GARCH estimated volatility to measure stock and bond market volatility. Also VIX index is used to measure stock market volatility and robust check for result. We use vector auto regression (VAR) model and E-GARCH model with stock markets volume changes for measure relation between stock and bond, returns and volatility. Result shows that three important results. First, one lagged stock market volatility increase the short term bond market return. Second, stock market new information which is measured by stock volume changes affects bond market structure. Third, stock market volatility has asymetric effects on short term and long term bond market volatility. Our findings show strong evidence of risk spillover between US stock market and bond market. Furthermore, our findings have some important implication for financial investor and policy makers for showing the linkage structure between stock market and bond market.",
