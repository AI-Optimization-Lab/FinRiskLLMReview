  "abstract": "Understanding an enterprise's workforce and skill-set can be seen as the key to understanding an organization's capabilities. In today's large organizations it has become increasingly difficult to find people that have specific skills or expertise or to explore and understand the overall picture of an organization's portfolio of topic expertise. This article presents a case study of analyzing and visualizing such expertise with the goal of enabling human users to assess and quickly find people with a desired skill set. Our approach is based on techniques like n-grams, clustering, and visualization for improving the user search experience for people and skills.",
