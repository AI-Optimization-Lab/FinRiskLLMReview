  "title": "Commercial Bank's RMB Financial Products and Countermeasures for Supervision",
  "abstract": "This article summarizes the general situation of commercial bank's RMB financial products in recent years. It includes the classification, the development course and the present situation of RMB financial products. Because RMB financial service is also in the immature period in our country, these products have many problems and risks such as the financial products level needs to be promoted urgently, more serious situation in the information disclosure, the information supporting program of the products does not adapt to the trade development etc. We propose concrete solutions and suggestions such as strengthen products' variation degree, establish complete information disclosure mechanism and perfect risk management, and increase investment in science and technology to cultivate high-quality personnel to promote commercial bank's RMB financial products' maturity and perfection in our country.",
