  "title": "A class of nonlinear multi-objective mixed integer programming model for oil and gas portfolio and algorithm solution",
  "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the oil & gas assets portfolio. A multi-objective portfolio model of oil & gas assets is studied from two perspectives-scale and revenue. Considering the nonlinear and integer constraints in the model, a class of oil & gas assets portfolio model of nonlinear multi-objective mixed integer programming is established. The weight of the multi-objective is solved by the support vector machine model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, which uses the position displacement strategy of the particle swarm optimizer as a mutation operation, is applied to the optimization model. Finally, two examples are applied to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm.",
