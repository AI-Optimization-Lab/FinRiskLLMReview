  "title": "Portfolio Optimization via Copula-EGARCH-CVaR Model",
  "abstract": "By combining Copula approaches, Copula-EGARCH model which describes the joint distribution of portfolio return is established. This model not only describes the properties, such as Leptokurtosis and fat tail, volatility clustering, leverage effect, asymmetric volatility etc, but also captures the nonlinear correlation between two assets, which compared with the traditional normal hypothesis of return distribution is more consistent to reality. Based on this model, the CVaR-Mean model of portfolio selection under no short sale constraint is solved by Monte Carlo simulation. The optimal investment strategies and efficient frontiers of Gaussian Copula and t-Copula are derived.",
