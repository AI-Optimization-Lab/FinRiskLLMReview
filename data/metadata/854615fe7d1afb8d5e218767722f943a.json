  "title": "Enhancing optimization efficiency with fuzzy neural network for behavioral portfolio theory",
  "abstract": "This study proposes a behavioral portfolio model based on the fuzzy neural network, for enhancing optimization efficiency. Different from Shefrin and Statman's Behavioral Portfolio Theory (BPT), there is a dynamic relationship hypothesis among multiple mental accounting of bounded rational decision-makers. Considering the fuzzy and dynamic attributes of these relationships, a fuzzy neural network is introduced for describing the states and evolution process of each mental account's weight. This study formed the dynamic switch model of multiple mental accounting, from the view of their actual decision-making psychology, which describing the influential mechanism of investors' portfolio decision-making in the uncertainty conditions. With the fuzzy neural network as core, it's proposed the adjusted BPT model with changeable weight coefficients. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated with results of numerical simulation.",
