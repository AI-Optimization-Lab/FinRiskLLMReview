  "title": "THE RISKINESS AND PROFITABILITY OF SLOVAK AGRICULTURE COMPANIES AND THEIR DETERMINANTS",
  "abstract": "The article analyses, using the knowledge of macroeconomics, statistical analysis and econometrics, the interaction of the financial indicators - Profit and Risk in relation with indicators from balance sheets and profit and loss statements of 996 Slovak agriculture companies operating in Slovakia in examined period 2009 - 2012. To verify the existence of interactions between the studied variables and to detect the factor, which have significant impact on the return and risk, article uses the statistical methods of regression and correlation analyses, which results are summarized in a compendious table.",
