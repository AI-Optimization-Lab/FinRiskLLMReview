  "title": "COVID-19 Concerns and Depression Among Older Adults: Does Race/Ethnic Status Moderate the Association?",
  "abstract": "Background and Objectives: This study examined the association between COVID-19 concerns and depression among adults in later life. We also examined whether race/ethnic status moderated this relationship. Research Design and Methods: This study used data from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study. Using the 8-item CES-D scale, we defined probable depression as having three or more depressive symptoms. COVID-19 concerns included items such as concerns about respondents' own health, the health of family members, respondents' ability to get help from others, and concerns about the future. The associations between COVID-19 concerns and older adults' depression were estimated with logistic regression models. Results: Compared to respondents with lower scores on the COVID-19 concern measures, those with higher scores were more likely to be depressed. The moderation model showed the relationship between concerns about what will happen in the future and depression was not as strong among non-Hispanic Black older adults compared to non-Hispanic White older adults. Concerns about own health, family members' health, the older adult's financial situation, and the ability to get help did not show moderation effects. Discussion and Implications: The results suggested that healthcare providers should focus on older persons to reduce disparities in the risk of depression during public health emergencies.",
