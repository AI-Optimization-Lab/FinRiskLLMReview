  "title": "Early detection of financial problems in Quebec dairy operations",
  "abstract": "The important demand for credit, to ensure the financial viability of farms, makes them more vulnerable because of the inherent risk in agriculture. This paper attempts to determine the most important variables closely linked with financial distress of Quebec dairy farms. Using the Agritel data base, 67 financially healthy farms and 41 in financial distress in 1992 are selected. For each group, data from 1988 to 1992 are used. Logistic regression models, discriminant analysis and nonparametric discriminant analysis are adopted. We find that current and long-term debt are very important. Farms in distress in 1988 had larger short-term debt than healthy ones. Farms must have good enough technical and economic results to reach a minimum level of viability. Nonproductive fixed assets must be limited. These three types of variables must be considered to make an effective diagnosis. Five variables are retained to make a diagnosis up to five years before the financial distress occurs.",
