  "title": "A simulation-based decision support methodology for reuse business",
  "abstract": "Reuse business involving the collection of products and their reuse in the same or other markets constitutes one of the key issues concerning the shift toward a society that consumes materials more efficiently. This paper describes how to plan a new reuse business based on the current product selling business. Life cycle simulation (LCS) is applied to estimate financial and environmental revenues. Decision tree analysis embedded LCS is performed to quantify the uncertainty of various business scenarios. An example of rental PC business is demonstrated in this paper. The proposed methodology is useful for manufacturing companies that wish to launch a reuse business with less business risk.",
