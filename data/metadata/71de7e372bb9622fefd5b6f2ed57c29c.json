  "title": "Design and Development of ICU Intelligent Medicine Management System Based on MVC",
  "abstract": "With the popularity of Internet and management informationization, people's understanding and demand of information technology has increased significantly, it is especially important for top hospitals where large amounts of information need to be processed. Medicine management is the core of hospital management, and it is the most promising link to cut down the expense and increase the income. Because there are many types of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and a wide variety of drugs stored there, especially many high risk medicines, the workload of medicine management for medical staff in ICU is really heavy. ICU intelligent medicine management system was designed in accordance with the requirements of the new financial system of the Ministry of Health, and the classification coding system was national standard. At the same time, it promote the realization of the integration of prescription, dispensing and inventory management. The ICU intelligent medicine management system was constituted of human-computer interaction modules (touch screen and fingerprint entry device), motherboard module, mechanical and electrical control module (I/O), communication module (printer, HIS), drawer storage module and narcotic drugs information system module. It used Java as a programming tool, applied user-friendly and powerful Dream Weaver as a development tool, and used JSP/JAVA, also Java, MySQL5 and Tomcat7 as the server-side, Client-side scripting tool, Database and Server respectively. Moreover, this system used Struts, session management, filters and database integration technology, built robust applications, whole prepared through the MVC mode, and had a very good scalability.",
