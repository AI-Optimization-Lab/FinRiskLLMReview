  "title": "Financial Management and Early Warning System of Non-profit Organizations Based on Artificial Neural Network",
  "abstract": "With the deepening of the global political and economic system reform, the third sector between the government and for-profit enterprises-non-profit organizations has developed rapidly as a public welfare sector, and its impact on the society is also increasing. At present, non-profit organizations are in a critical period of social organization reform, and the safety and reliability of financial affairs within the organization has gradually become an important measure for their long-term development in the future. The research on financial risk of non-profit organizations is not only an emerging field in modern public management, but also an indispensable part of the management system of non-profit organizations. With the rapid development of non-profit organizations, the complexity and uncertainty of the financial environment have become increasingly prominent. Therefore, how to establish an effective and sound financial early warning system to forecast the financial risks faced by non-profit organizations in the operation process and prevent financial The emergence of crisis has become one of the urgent financial management issues. In this paper, the method of artificial neural network is used, and its prediction accuracy is much higher than that of traditional statistical methods, and it has broad application prospects in this field.",
