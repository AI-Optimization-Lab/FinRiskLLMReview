  "title": "The Covid Impact to Public Healthcare Utilization Among Urban Low-Income Subsidized Community in Klang Valley Malaysia",
  "abstract": "Background: Appropriate level of healthcare utilization is one of the aims in translating health system inputs into improving the outcome of population health. Healthcare utilization services in Malaysia remains relatively low as compared to the rate in most high-income countries and some gaps exist across socioeconomic status. After the financial handouts deemed Household Living Aid (HLA) to low-income earners, Malaysia has recently implemented a financial health protection scheme toward for low-income group known as PeKa B40 to improve their access for healthcare services. This study aims to determine the healthcare utilization among the low-income population living in urban Klang Valley, and to explore the relationship between healthcare utilization with the demographic characteristics of this population. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study using face to face structured questionnaire. All 447 respondents included were low-income earners enrolled in the HLA. Chi-square analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to examine association between the risk factors and healthcare utilization. Results: The response rate was 93.5%. The healthcare utilization among the respondents during the partial lockdown period was 19.5% and 33.1% during the recovery lockdown period. Enrollment in the PeKa B40 scheme among the 7.6% respondents was not associated with healthcare utilization. After controlling for the variables, those aged 60 years and above [AOR: 1.87; 95% (CI): (1.07; 3.27)], self-rated poor health status [AOR: 2.16; 95% (CI): (1.07; 4.34)], having NCDs [AOR: 4.21; 95% (CI): (2.23; 7.94)], and being hospitalized in the past 12 months [AOR: 3.54; 95% (CI): (1.46; 8.62)], were more likely to utilize healthcare services as compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: The results from this study is valuable for policy recommendations to improve on the coverage of the PeKa B40 scheme and healthcare access for the low-income population especially during the pandemic.",
