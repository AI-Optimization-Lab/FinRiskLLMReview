  "title": "Quantum-inspired variational algorithms for partial differential equations: application to financial derivative pricing",
  "abstract": "Variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) combined with neural-network quantum states offers a novel angle of attack on the curse-of-dimensionality encountered in a particular class of partial differential equations (PDEs); namely, the real- and imaginary time-dependent Schrodinger equation. In this paper, we present a simple generalization of VMC applicable to arbitrary time-dependent PDEs, showcasing the technique in the multi-asset Black-Scholes PDE for pricing European options contingent on many correlated underlying assets.",
