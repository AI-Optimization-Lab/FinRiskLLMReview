  "title": "Portfolio assessment: direct from the classroom",
  "abstract": "Portfolios have been regarded as a means of personal self-expression. This study reports on student real-life experiences with portfolio assessment. The focus group comprised 150 freshmen (100 females) from a small campus of a tertiary educational institution. For two semesters (approximately 30 weeks), students engaged in numerous activities selected to encourage deep learning and understanding of mathematical concepts. Because students were not involved in the experiment, ecological validity was maximised, and observations may be regarded as fairly authentic and worthy of analysis. Generally, students reported learning much from portfolio assessment and felt an integral part of the assessment process. Portfolio assessment appeared to empower students and provide them with the self-respect they desired. Future research could compare results from everyday observations with those from experiments.",
