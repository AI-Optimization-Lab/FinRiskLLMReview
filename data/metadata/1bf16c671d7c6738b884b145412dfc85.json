  "title": "A Cross - Border Evidence of Income Diversification, Foreign Ownership and Bank Stability",
  "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the impact of income diversification and foreign ownership on the financial stability of the banks. By employing panel regression technique with random effect of listed banks from 8 Asia Pacific countries throughout 2005-2015, the results suggest that income diversification and foreign ownership influenced the financial stability of banks. This result is consistent with the conventional wisdom that non-traditional income is more stable, and fee-based income will reduce banks' risk. This finding implies that foreign ownership increases financial stability in the Asia Pacific region by reducing risk, which indicates evidence of the global advantage hypothesis.",
