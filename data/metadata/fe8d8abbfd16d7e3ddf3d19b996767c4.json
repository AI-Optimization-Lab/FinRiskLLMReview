  "title": "Reasons for Readmission After Carotid Endarterectomy",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: With increasing oversight of postoperative outcomes with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the reduction of readmissions is necessary to avoid financial penalties. This article provides a multi-institutional, multivariate analysis of the pre- and postoperative patient factors associated with readmission after carotid endarterectomy ( CEA). METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011, we considered 8456 patients. The primary outcome variable was 30-day unplanned readmission. Multiple logistic regression was used, and we controlled for preoperative demographic variables, comorbidities and clinical characteristics, and postoperative medical and surgical complications. RESULTS: Patients with CEA had a 6.0% unplanned readmission rate. The most common comorbidities in the readmitted patients included hypertension, diabetes, and bleeding disorder. Risk-adjusted multiple regression indicated that preoperative bleeding disorder ( odds ratio [ OR] 1.62), diabetes ( OR 1.46), history of a cerebrovascular accident/stroke ( OR 1.46), and increasing age ( OR 1.01) were statistically significant predictors for readmission. Postoperatively, surgical-site infection ( OR 21.90), myocardial infarction ( OR 10.35), sepsis/septic shock ( OR 7.79), cerebrovascular accident/stroke ( OR 6.58), pneumonia ( OR 4.37), and urinary tract infection ( OR 3.21) were associated with a greater rate of readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission after CEA occurs at a comparatively high rate. Preoperative bleeding disorders, diabetes, cerebrovascular accidents, and age and postoperative surgical-site infection, myocardial infarction, sepsis/septic shock, pneumonia, and cerebrovascular accident were associated with readmission. These findings may help guide the surgical management of patients and prevent costly readmissions.",
