  "title": "The epidemiology of pediatric oncology and hematopoietic cell transplant admissions to US intensive care units from 2001-2019",
  "abstract": "Children with cancer or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) frequently require ICU care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Inpatient Databases from 21 U.S. states from 2001-2019. We included children <18 years with oncologic or HCT diagnosis and used ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes to identify diagnoses, comorbidities, and organ failures. We used generalized linear Poisson regression and Cuzick's test of trend to evaluate changes from 2001-2019. Among 2,157,991 total pediatric inpatient admissions, 3.9% (n=82,988) were among oncology patients and 0.3% (n=7,381) were among HCT patients. ICU admission prevalence rose from 13.6% in 2001 to 14.4% in 2019 for oncology admissions and declined from 23.9% to 19.5%, for HCT admissions. Between 2001-2019, the prevalence of chronic non-oncologic comorbidities among ICU patients rose from 44.3% to 69.1% for oncology patients (RR 1.60 [95% CI 1.46-1.66]) and from 41.4% to 81.5% (RR 1.94 [95% CI 1.61-2.34]) for HCT patients. The risk of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome more than tripled for oncology (9.5% to 33.3%; RR 3.52 [95% CI 2.97-4.18]) and HCT (12.4% to 39.7%; RR 3.20 [95% CI 2.09-4.89]) patients. Mortality decreased most for ICU patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (14.6% to 8.5%) and oncology-related HCTs (15.5% to 9.2%). Critically ill pediatric oncology and HCT patients are increasingly medically complex with greater prevalence of chronic comorbidities and organ failure, but mortality did not increase. Pediatric ICUs may require increased financial and staffing support to care for these patients in the future.",
