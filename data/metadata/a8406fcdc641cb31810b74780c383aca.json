  "title": "Towards a taxonomy-based preferred-customer model for suppliers in air cargo express service markets",
  "abstract": "Drawing on social exchange and push-pull-mooring theories, this paper develops a taxonomy-based preferred customer model for B2B air express markets. Our model extends the conventional bilateral customer-supplier relationship perspective of customer portfolio management to include competition effects for more comprehensive (trilateral) strategic decision making. Based on this unified framework, our a survey of 180 customers of air cargo express carriers identifies three distinctive groups of preferred customers. In addition to the effect of competitors on air express carriers' prioritization of customers, which is further complicated by a satisfaction paradox and spurious loyalty, we further establish classification indicators for differentiating preferred from non preferred customers. Notably, although commonly used in practice, we find sales volumes to be ineffective for that purpose.",
