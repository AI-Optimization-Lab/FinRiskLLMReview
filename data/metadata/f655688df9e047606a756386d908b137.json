  "title": "THE IMPACT OF INNOVATIONS ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE PORT SECTOR: A LITERATURE REVIEW",
  "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to analyze the scientific literature to highlight the impacts of innovations throughout the evolution of the port sector and its current innovation trends and processes. For this purpose, a literature review was carried out with the support of the ProKnow-C instrument to select a Bibliographic Portfolio (BP) composed of 44 relevant and representative articles for the research. The BP analysis showed market demand and regulations as the main factors in the selection of innovations; ports '4.0' and 'green' ports as current technological trajectories; and the collaborative trend among the sector's actors.",
