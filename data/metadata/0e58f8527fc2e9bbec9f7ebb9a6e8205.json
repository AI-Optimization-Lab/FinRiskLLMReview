  "title": "Big Data Analysis of Financial Risk and Avoidance Strategy-Based on Futures Industry",
  "abstract": "This paper discussed the financial risks faced by the futures companies, and the necessity for futures companies to apply bid data system which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of reducing the financial risk and establishing beforehand warning model by means of big data intelligence analysis and quantitative modeling such as CTA strategy. In addition, this paper establishes a regression model by analyzing the indicators of market liquidity direction and finds the linkage relationship between market liquidity and futures contract price, so that the real-time monitoring and management of futures companies' changes of various factors can become possible under the big data system.",
