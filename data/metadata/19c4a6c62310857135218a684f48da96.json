  "title": "Financial risk forecasting with nonlinear dynamics and support vector regression",
  "abstract": "We propose a dynamical description of financial time series capable of making short-term prediction utilizing support vector regression on neighbourhood points. We include in our analysis estimation on the uncertainty by capturing the exogenous from historical prediction errors and adopting a probabilistic description of the prediction. Evidences from a series of backtesting using financial time series indicate that our model provides accurate description of real market data comparable with GARCH(1,1).",
