  "title": "Performance Evaluation of Reverse Logistics: Opportunities for Future Research",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of the scientific research that approaches Reverse Logistics (RL) from the perspective of Performance Evaluation (PE). For this purpose, ProKnow-C was used to select 21 articles to compose a Bibliographical Portfolio (BP). Among the results, we mention Govindan, Sarkis, Zhu and Lai as prominent authors. By analyzing the articles, it was perceived that most of them perform the RL and PE fields separately and present tools that consider the alignment of the indicators with the strategy. Also, the articles lack of a structured PE process that could serve as a subsidy to the practice of logistics management. The results present that there is a theoretical gap in the literature of a PE model of RL.",
