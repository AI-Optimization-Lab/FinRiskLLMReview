  "abstract": "Purpose: Although research evidence indicates positive associations between stressful life events and postpartum depression, limited research assessed these associations in women with disabilities. This study examined the effects of stressful life events on postpartum depressive symptoms in women with disabilities. Methods: Data from the 2012-2017 Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (n=8453) were used in this study. Women were asked if they experienced any life stressors (e.g. financial, traumatic, relational, and emotional) during the 12 months prior to giving birth. Disability was measured based on reports of emotional and physical functioning. Descriptive statistics, bivariate, and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of stressful life events on postpartum depressive symptoms among women with and without disabilities. Results: Findings show that 37.4% of women with disabilities had postpartum depressive symptoms, which was significantly higher than 8.79% of women without disabilities. Stressful life events were reported in 86.6% of women with disabilities, compared to 66.6% for women without disabilities. Prevalence of three or more stressful life events and postpartum depressive symptoms was greater among women with disabilities (50.8% and 62.9%, respectively) than women without disabilities (22.6% and 37.0%, respectively). Women with disabilities experiencing six or more stressful life events were more likely (odds ratio = 3.78, 95% confidence interval = [1.57-9.10]) to report postpartum depressive symptoms, compared to those with no stressful life events. Women with disabilities who experienced relational (odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval = [1.44-3.87]) and traumatic (odds ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval = [1.02-3.00]) life stressors had higher odds for postpartum depressive symptoms relative to those reporting no such life stressors. Conclusion: Women with disabilities are at an amplified risk for stressful life events and postpartum depressive symptoms. Relational and traumatic stressful life events particularly increase the odds for postpartum depressive symptoms among this group of mothers. Early prenatal and postnatal screening for life stressors and depressive symptoms, coupled with timely referral for appropriate prenatal and postnatal care, are vital to mitigate the harmful effects of depression among mothers with disabilities and the health of their children.",
