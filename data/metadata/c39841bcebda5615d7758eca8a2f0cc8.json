  "title": "Factors Affecting Loan Supply Behavior at the Sharia Business Unit of Bank Sulselbar",
  "abstract": "The study was conducted to assist the Sharia Business Unit of Bank Sulselbar in an effort to increase sharia financing portfolio. The study examines four variables (deposit funds, cash, placement, profit sharing) that affect financing volume. The data were collected from a quarterly published financial report in the period between December 2009 to June 2017 and Indonesian Statistical Report. With the use of multiple regression analysis to test the studied variables, it is found that deposit fund and GRDP affect positively and significantly to the total volume of sharia financing, whereas cash and placement with other banks negatively affect the total volume of financing with the insignificant score for placement. Interestingly, profit sharing ratio affects negatively and significantly to the total volume of sharia financing.",
