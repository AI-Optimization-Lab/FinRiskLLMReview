  "title": "Associations of food insecurity and material social support with parent and child mental health during COVID-19",
  "abstract": "The rise of mental health problems during COVID-19 has been called a national crisis. Parents and caregivers reported parenting stress, anxiety, and depression, which may be exacerbated by economic insecurity. This study used longitudinal data to examine the association of food insecurity and material social support to subsequent parent and child mental health outcomes in the early weeks of COVID-19. Data were collected from a national convenience sample of U.S. parents (N = 359) at two time points: April 14, 2020 (T1) and April 30, 2020 (T2). Data were analyzed using multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses. Most of the sample were mothers (67.5%) and identified as White (69.6%). Among parents for whom services were applicable, over half (51.4%) were unable to receive free and reduced-cost school-based lunch. Food insecurity at T1 was significantly associated with higher odds of parental anxiety (OR = 1.52, p <.001) and depression (OR = 1.63, p <.001), as well as increased parenting stress (13 = 0.16, p =.008) and parental report of child anxiety (13 = 0.15, p =.014). Conversely, material social support was significantly associated with lower odds of parental anxiety (OR = 0.90, p =.014) and depression (OR = 0.85, p <.001), as well as lower levels of parenting stress (13 =-0.20, p =.001) and parental report of child anxiety (13 =-0.13, p =.028). Results suggest that household food insecurity may place parents and children at greater risk for mental health problems during COVID-19. However, access to tangible resources that offer material or financial support may be protective for both parent and child mental health. Study results suggest that policy interventions are needed to support the economic wellbeing of families during COVID-19.",
