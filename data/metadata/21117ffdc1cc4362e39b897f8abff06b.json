  "title": "INTEGRATING THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN RATIONALITY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS DECISION",
  "abstract": "This article is based on a secondary analysis of data from a research conducted in 2015 in twelve towns in Gorj County, Romania, that make up a Task Force for the Local Community Development Network. This study was wanted to acknowledge the effects of the European funding on the sustainable development of the communities that make up the local action group. Analyses were made to a representative sample composed of farmers who have accessed European funding to equip their farms, the potential beneficiaries of such funding and area leaders of the local action group. The study findings have revealed the different perception on funding support and the usefulness of these instruments in terms of categories of users and staff development. Explanatory theories provide a framework to develop a complex context in which the social and economic development is initiated and becomes a procedural aspect, which according to the classification of Alvin J. So [1] refers to changing one-way stage process, the phases of homogenized transition process of Europeanization's irreversible and progressive process. Unfortunately Romania failed to fully absorb the European funds available. The present study reveals that there is a limited overlap of rationality in financial measures, which integrates some principles of sustainable and economic development, social and environmental protection and more rational beneficiaries. The need for investment is recognized by all stakeholders, but the local social-economic multitude of factors involved in the benefit-risk felt by farmers. This article reveals convergence factors between the farms owner's expectations and the possible funding based on the relationships between benefits and risks.",
