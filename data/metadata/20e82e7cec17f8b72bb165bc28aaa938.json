  "title": "The influence of perceived risk and perceived value toward tourist satisfaction",
  "abstract": "Satisfaction is the most pivotal factor in the service industry. This study is aimed at finding out the impact of perceived risk and perceived value on tourist satisfaction of Cerme Cave. The dependent variable (X) of the study is perceived risk (X1) consisting of physical risk, performance risk, financial risk, and psychological risk and perceived value (X2) consisting of functional value and emotional value. Meanwhile, the independent variable (Y) is tourist satisfaction. The study applies purposive sampling involving 111 samples. The data is collected through questionnaires, which were then analyzed descriptively and verified through multivariate regression. The result, simultaneously, perceived risk and perceived value, gives significant impact on tourist satisfaction of Cerme Cave. Physical risk and emotional value have the highest score (340; 435,66). It means Cerme Cave succeeded in creating the tourists' satisfaction that was gained from the program, which can help tourists developing their perception on risk and value.",
