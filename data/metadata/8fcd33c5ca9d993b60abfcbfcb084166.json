  "title": "Patient and practice factors associated with HbA1c testing frequency in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study in Australian general practice",
  "abstract": "Background Better adherence to guideline-recommended glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing frequency is associated with better glycaemic control and lower risk of complications such as chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study investigates patient and practice factors associated with adherence to guideline-recommended HbA1c testing frequency.Methods A cohort of type 2 diabetes patients who regularly visited general practices from 2012 to 2018 was identified from 225 Australian general practices. With the goal of <= 53 mmol/mol, Australian guidelines recommend HbA1c testing at least 6-monthly. Patient history of HbA1c tests from 2017 to 2018 was used to define adherence to guidelines, and the associations with patient and practice factors were examined by regression models.Results Of the 6881 patients, 2186 patients (31.8%) had 6-monthly HbA1c testing. Patient age and anti-diabetic medications were associated with adherence to 6-monthly testing. When financial incentives are available to practices, a larger practice was associated with better adherence to 6-monthly testing.Conclusions The identified key factors such as age, practice size, medication, and incentive payments can be used to target initiatives aimed at improving guideline-recommended monitoring care for patients with type 2 diabetes to enhance their health outcomes.",
