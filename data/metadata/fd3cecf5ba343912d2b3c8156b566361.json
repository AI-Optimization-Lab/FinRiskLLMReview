  "title": "Chinese A Share Stock Ranking with Machine Learning Apporach",
  "abstract": "How to choose stocks to make a profitable portfolio is a core question in the financial industry for stock trading. In this paper, different machine learning models are explored and compared in choosing stocks that have the highest rising probability to outperform the median return rate in Chinese A Share stock market. Random Forest achieves best performance both in predictive accuracy and annual return.",
