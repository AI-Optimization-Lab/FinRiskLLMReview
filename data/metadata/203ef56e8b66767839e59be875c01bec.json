  "title": "The differential effects of identity theft victimization: how demographics predict suffering out-of-pocket losses",
  "abstract": "Research consistently finds that individuals with higher incomes have increased rates of identity theft victimization. Although the majority of these victims are able to recuperate losses by contacting various institutions, including credit card companies and banks, many victims still suffer out-of-pocket financial losses. Using logistic regression analyses, the effect of demographic predictors on suffering personal financial losses as a result of identity theft is examined. Drawing on the 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey-Identity Theft Supplement, this study finds that those with lower incomes, lower educational attainment, and those who are unmarried are at an increased risk of suffering out-of-pocket losses. The implications of these differential effects are discussed in the context of past research and victim support.",
