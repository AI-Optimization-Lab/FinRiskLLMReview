  "title": "PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT FOR ELECTRIC DRIVES IN POWERTOOLS AT HILTI: CHALLENGES AND SOLUTION APPROACHES",
  "abstract": "The Hilti product portfolio contains a wide spectrum of electric powertools for construction professionals. The electric drive is an important subsystem within the powertools and a decisive driver for differentiation, but also a source of growing complexity due to its mechatronical character. At the interface between tool and drive development, this leads to increased technical and organizational challenges. This contribution presents an approach towards portfolio and complexity management at the Hilti Electronics & Drives development based on product platforms. The first aspect includes a recently introduced platform process as a means for an efficient organization of the platform development. A second aspect deals with creating more transparency in the portfolio, based on a structured visualization of the system architecture. Finally a concept is presented towards more conscious decision making in portfolio management, including a classification of decision situations and a guideline for the decision making process. The methodology is applied at Hilti since roughly one year, the feedback and effects are rather positive and the methodology is continuously expanded.",
