  "title": "The model and application of the financial risk evaluation in power enterprises based on improved BP neural network algorithm",
  "abstract": "At present, the traditional or commonly used methods to measure the financial risk in power enterprises is limited and inadequate. To evaluate the financial risk of the power enterprises scientifically and accurately, this paper proposes the improved BP neural network model which imports the adjustable activation function and the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm for the financial risk evaluation. The improved model not only can simulate the expert in evaluating the financial risk and avoiding the subjective mistakes in the evaluation process, but also enhance the learning accuracy and the algorithm convergence speed greatly. The financial risk evaluation of 12 power enterprises in National Power Company shows that the improved model is stable and reliable, and this method to forecast the financial risk of the power enterprises is feasible.",
