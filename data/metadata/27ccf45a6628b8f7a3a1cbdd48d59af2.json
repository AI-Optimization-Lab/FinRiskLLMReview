  "title": "The Risk Characteristics Analysis of Chinese Local Government Bonds",
  "abstract": "China has begun issuing local government bonds since March 2009, whose release can effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of local governments and implement the proactive fiscal policy However, local government bonds as a financial instrument is also a risk, and have their unique risk characteristics in China's economic background and institutional context This article analyzed the characteristics risk of Chinese local government bonds from different aspects, and classified the different risks of the different levels of classification, and put forward the corresponding risk prevention measures for the major characteristics risk.",
