  "title": "Impact of low-value medications on quality of life, hospitalization and costs - A longitudinal analysis of patients living with dementia",
  "abstract": "IntroductionThis study aimed to analyze the impact of low-value medications (Lvm), that is, medications unlikely to benefit patients but to cause harm, on patient-centered outcomes over 24 months. MethodsThis longitudinal analysis was based on baseline, 12 and 24 months follow-up data of 352 patients with dementia. The impact of Lvm on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), hospitalizations, and health care costs were assessed using multiple panel-specific regression models. ResultsOver 24 months, 182 patients (52%) received Lvm at least once and 56 (16%) continuously. Lvm significantly increased the risk of hospitalization by 49% (odds ratio, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.06-2.09; p = 0.022), increased health care costs by euro6810 (CI 95% -707euro-14,27euro; p = 0.076), and reduced patients' HRQoL (b = -1.55; CI 95% -2.76 to -0.35; p = 0.011). DiscussionMore than every second patient received Lvm, negatively impacting patient-reported HRQoL, hospitalizations, and costs. Innovative approaches are needed to encourage prescribers to avoid and replace Lvm in dementia care. HighlightsOver 24 months, more than every second patient received low-value medications (Lvm).Lvm negatively impact physical, psychological, and financial outcomes.Appropriate measures are needed to change prescription behaviors.",
