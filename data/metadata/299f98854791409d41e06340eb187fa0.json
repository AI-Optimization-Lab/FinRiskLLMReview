  "abstract": "We investigate optimal portfolio choice for an investor who is skeptical about the degree to which excess returns are predictable. Skepticism is modeled as an informative prior over the R-2 of the predictive regression. We find that the evidence is sufficient to convince even an investor with a highly skeptical prior to vary his portfolio on the basis of the dividend-price ratio and the yield spread. The resulting weights are less volatile and deliver superior out-of-sample performance as compared to the weights implied by an entirely model-based or data-based view. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
