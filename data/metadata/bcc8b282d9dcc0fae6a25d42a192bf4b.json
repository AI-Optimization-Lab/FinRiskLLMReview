  "title": "METHODOLOGY OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN PIPELINE PROJECTS",
  "abstract": "Organizations of all types and sizes face internal and external factors and influences that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their business objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on an organization's objectives is RISK. In recent times all sectors of the economy have shifted focus towards the management of risk as the key to making organizations successful in delivering their objectives while protecting the interests of their stakeholders. Risk may be defined as events or conditions that may occur, and whose occurrence, if it does take place, has a harmful or negative impact on the achievement of the organization's business objectives. The exposure to the consequences of uncertainty constitutes a risk. Organizations that are most effective and efficient in managing risks to both existing assets and to future growth will, in the long run, outperform those that are less so. Simply put, companies make money by taking intelligent risks and lose money by failing to manage risk intelligently. Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives, whether positive or negative) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities. Risks can come from uncertainty in financial markets, project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters as well as deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. Several risk management standards have been developed including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and ISO standards. Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, engineering, industrial processes, financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety. Risk management is a holistic, integrated, structured and disciplined approach to managing risks with the objective of maximizing shareholder's value. It aligns strategy, processes, people & culture, technology and governance with the purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties faced by the organization while creating value. Broadly this paper deals with the objective of risk management along with identification, polarization, mitigation and governance of risks associated with pipeline projects. Further the criteria for assigning the probabilities and impact of an identified risk along with their classification based on its probability and impact are also incorporated in the paper.",
