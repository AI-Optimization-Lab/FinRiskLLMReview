  "abstract": "This article provides an overview of the quantitative methods used in research on Corporate Universities and Organizational Learning. The analysis was based on a bibliographic portfolio consisting of 20 articles published in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, selected using the Knowledge Development Process -Constructivist (Proknow-C) methodology. The results of the analysis revealed that: i) descriptive statistics were the most commonly used quantitative method; ii) Likert scales were the most frequently used measurement format; iii) questionnaires were the most commonly used data collection instrument; iv) there was a considerable variation in sample sizes across the publications, with judgment sampling being the most prevalent; and v) in terms of literature and prominent authors, no significant bibliography support was found in the sample. The study found that many of the articles in the Bibliographic Portfolio (BP) lacked detailed description of the adopted methodological procedures, which could potentially contribute to a broader analysis and replication of the studies.",
