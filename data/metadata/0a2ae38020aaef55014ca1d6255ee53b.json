  "title": "Sample Path Generation of the Stochastic Volatility CGMY Process and Its Application to Path-Dependent Option Pricing",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes the sample path generation method for the stochastic volatility version of the CGMY process. We present the Monte-Carlo method for European and American option pricing with the sample path generation and calibrate model parameters to the American style S&P 100 index options market, using the least square regression method. Moreover, we discuss path-dependent options, such as Asian and Barrier options.",
