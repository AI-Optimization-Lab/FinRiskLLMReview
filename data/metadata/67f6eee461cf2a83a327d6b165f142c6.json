  "title": "Impact of frailty on clinical outcomes and resource utilization of hospitalizations for renal stone surgery",
  "abstract": "PurposeFrailty is reportedly associated with poorer outcomes among surgical patients. Using a coding-based frailty tool, we investigated the impact of frailty on clinical outcomes and resource utilization for urolithiasis hospitalizations.MethodsA cohort study using the 2018 National Inpatient Sample database. All adult elective hospitalizations for urolithiasis were included in the study. The study population was categorized into FRAIL and non-frail (nFRAIL) cohorts using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty clusters. The association between frailty and clinical and financial outcomes was evaluated using multivariate regression models.ResultsAbout 1028 (14.9%) out of 6900 total hospitalizations were frail. Frailty was not associated with a significant increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.73, 95% CI 0.15-20.02) or length of hospital stay, but was associated with a lower chance of surgery within 24 h of admission (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.90, P = 0.008). A higher Charlson index was independently associated with an over 100% increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR 2.091, 95% CI 1.53-2.86, P < 0.001). Frail patients paid $15,993 higher in total hospital costs and had a higher likelihood of non-home discharges (aOR 4.29, 95% CI 2.74-6.71, P < 0.001) and peri-operative complications (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14-2.73, P = 0.01).ConclusionFrailty was correlated with unfavorable outcomes, except mortality and prolonged hospital stay. Incorporating frailty evaluation into risk models has the potential to enhance patient selection and preparation for urolithiasis intervention.",
