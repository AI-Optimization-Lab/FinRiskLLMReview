  "title": "Volatility estimation with a neural network",
  "abstract": "The prediction of the volatility of financial time-series is very important for the evaluation and pricing of options and the development of option trading strategies. In this paper, a neural network for predicting the volatility of the German Bund future is presented. Its performance is compared to that of a nonlinear GARCH model.",
