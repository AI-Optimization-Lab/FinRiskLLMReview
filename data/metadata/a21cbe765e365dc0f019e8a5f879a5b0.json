  "title": "INTERNAL COMPETITION, ACTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND FUND PERFORMANCE",
  "abstract": "Clustering in shareholdings is one of the most common strategy that fund families use in Chinese stock market. The existence of internal competition among the funds in one family and clustering strategy they use, are deduced to cause the fund family to adopt positive portfolio strategy. We use game theory model to prove the existence of motivation to adopt positive portfolio strategy generated from fund family. We then use the empirical data from 2006 to 2015 to test the impact of positive portfolio strategy on funds' performance, using deviation of the fund from family portfolio to agent the index for measuring the positivity of the fund management. We find that positive portfolio strategy is related to higher fund performance, and deviation of the fund from family portfolio, proved robustly, can function as an important index in predicting and positively related to funds' performance.",
