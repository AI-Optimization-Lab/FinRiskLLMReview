  "title": "Does Confucianism still matter? A new insight from a study of the mental health of functionally dependent Korean older adults",
  "abstract": "This study explored predictors of functionally dependent Korean older adults' mental health. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using a sample of 1234 subjects. Findings show a subject's functional dependency, pre-existing depression, objective financial status, and stressful life events are risk factors. This analysis yielded unexpected findings of a limited protective effect of social support from family members compared to a significant effect of intrapersonal resources. These findings suggest an emergent transition within East Asian culture about individuals and family dynamics and a need for an alternative approach to culturally competent social work practice with East Asian populations.",
