  "title": "Effect on Intraocular Pressure in Patients Receiving Unilateral Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections",
  "abstract": "Purpose: We assessed the frequency and predictive factors related to intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients undergoing unilateral intravitreal ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab injections. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: Charts of 207 patients with neovascular AMD who presented to a single physician at a retinal referral practice over a 6-month period were retrospectively reviewed. Methods: Data recorded included demographic information, clinical findings, total number of bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections received and IOP at each visit. Increases above baseline IOP of >5, >10, or >15 mmHg on > 2 consecutive visits while under treatment were noted. Main Outcome Measures: The frequency of IOP elevation was compared between treated and untreated eyes. In addition, among treated eyes, frequency and odds ratio of experiencing IOP elevation >5 mmHg above baseline on >= 2 consecutive visits was stratified by number of injections. For the main regression analysis, the outcome variable was IOP elevation >5 mmHg on >= 2 consecutive visits and the main independent variable was total number of injections. Results: On >= 2 consecutive visits, 11.6% of treated versus 5.3% of untreated/control eyes experienced IOP elevation of >5 mmHg. The mean number of injections was higher in those with (24.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.9-28.0; range, 9-39) than without IOP elevation of >5 mmHg (20.4; 95% CI, 18.9-21.8; range, 3-48) on >= 2 consecutive visits. There was an increased odds ratio (5.75; 95% CI, 1.19-27.8; P = 0.03) of experiencing IOP elevation >5 mmHg on >= 2 consecutive visits in patients receiving >= 29 injections compared with <= 12 injections. Of the factors considered, only the total number of injections showed a statistically significant association with IOP elevation >5 mmHg above baseline on >= 2 consecutive visits in treated eyes (P = 0.05). Conclusions: A greater number of intravitreal anti-vasular endothelial growth factor injections is associated with an increased risk for IOP elevation >5 mmHg on >= 2 consecutive visits in eyes with neovascular AMD receiving intravitreal ranbizumab and/or bevacizumab.
