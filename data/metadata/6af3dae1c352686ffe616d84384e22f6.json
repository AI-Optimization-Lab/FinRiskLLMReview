  "title": "Financial Application: Predicting the Wealth Management Products Buying Behaviour of Listed Companies",
  "abstract": "The behaviors of business entities affect the entire business world in a variety of ways. Based on the prediction of these behaviors, we could make appropriate business plans in advance to achieve profitable investment, precision marketing and risk management. But factors affecting these business issues are complex and diverse, making financial analysis invalid. Big data technology based on machine learning brings us the dawn to business intelligence applications. In this paper, we will predict the wealth management products buying behaviour of Chinese listed companies by reasonably defining the capability range of machine learning algorithms to solve business problems. Our data comes from the financial database of the Wind, which provides strong support for real-time applications. We not only use the model to backtest historical data, but also deploy the model online to predict the behavior of 2019. In addition, we obtain the importance scores of factors that influence these predictions, providing valuable explanatory bases for business applications.",
