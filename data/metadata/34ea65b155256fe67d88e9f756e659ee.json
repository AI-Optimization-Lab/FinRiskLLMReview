  "title": "Integrating Digital Technologies in Sustainability Accounting and Reporting: Perceptions of Professional Cloud Computing Users",
  "abstract": "The configuration of economic development, through complexity, rhythm, and amplitude, imposed Industry 4.0 as a new industrial paradigm characterized by advanced digitalization and automation. Appropriate behavior of organizations from a sustainable perspective and the expansion of performance evaluations by considering economic-financial, social, and environmental aspects supposed the reconsideration of the role of accounting in reporting, advice on risk management, and determination of organizational policies. The application of digital technologies in sustainability accounting and reporting requires mapping the attributes of Industry 4.0 and the collection, processing, and reporting of financial and non-financial information. The purpose of this research consists of a correlative analysis of the impact of sustainable development constraints and Industry 4.0 on sustainability accounting and reporting. To collect information, we developed a semi-structured questionnaire, distributed to the members of The Romanian Chamber of Fiscal Consultants. The data have been processed using correlation and regression analysis. The odds of achieving a higher quality of information provided to stakeholders are greater for those interested in digital transformation, sustainable accounting and reporting digitization, while ensuring data protection and security. In the case of cloud computing users, the digitalization of sustainability accounting and reporting were identified as key factors in the process.",
