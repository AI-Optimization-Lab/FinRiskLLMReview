  "title": "MACROECONOMICS FRAMEWORK CONSIDERED RISK FACTORS: BASED ON DEFAULT DISTANCE",
  "abstract": "This paper adopts the macro-financial engineering method, taking risk factors into account to build a new framework for macroeconomic research in the IS-LM-BP model. Based on the balance of commodity markets, currency markets and the international balance of payments, the framework studies the balance of the level of risk, and analyzes a series of changes of the BP curve under given risk factors. Meanwhile, this paper also conducts empirical study using Chinese data from years 2007-2010.",
