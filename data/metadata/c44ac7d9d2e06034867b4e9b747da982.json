  "title": "Does intellectual capital have any influence on stock price crash risk?",
  "abstract": "Purpose This paper explores the influence between intellectual capital (IC) and the risk of stock price crashes by using company performance as an intervening variable. Design/methodology/approach This study empirically analyzes the impact of the efficiency of IC on stock price crash risk using a sample size of 152 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during 2018. To test the research hypotheses, regression analysis and path analysis were applied. In addition, the researchers added exploration to several studies to strengthen the results of this study. Findings This study's findings indicate that investors' optimistic (pessimistic) sentiment regarding stock price volatility has obscured aspects of the financial performance of listed companies. This finding implies that investor sentiment has dominated influence on stock price crash risk so that the aspects of IC are obscured. Originality/value This research provides new information that IC disclosure in the stock market needs to include knowledge of the volatility of stock prices in order to reveal stock price crash risk.",
