  "title": "Forecasting COVID-19 Pandemic Using Prophet, ARIMA, and Hybrid Stacked LSTM-GRU Models in India",
  "abstract": "Due to the proliferation of COVID-19, the world is in a terrible condition and human life is at risk. The SARS-CoV-2 virus had a significant impact on public health, social issues, and financial issues. Thousands of individuals are infected on a regular basis in India, which is one of the populations most seriously impacted by the pandemic. Despite modern medical and technical technology, predicting the spread of the virus has been extremely difficult. Predictive models have been used by health systems such as hospitals, to get insight into the influence of COVID-19 on outbreaks and possible resources, by minimizing the dangers of transmission. As a result, the main focus of this research is on building a COVID-19 predictive analytic technique. In the Indian dataset, Prophet, ARIMA, and stacked LSTM-GRU models were employed to forecast the number of confirmed and active cases. State-of-the-art models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), linear regression, polynomial regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Prophet were used to compare the outcomes of the prediction. After predictive research, the stacked LSTM-GRU model forecast was found to be more consistent than existing models, with better prediction results. Although the stacked model necessitates a large dataset for training, it aids in creating a higher level of abstraction in the final results and the maximization of the model's memory size. The GRU, on the other hand, assists in vanishing gradient resolution. The study findings reveal that the proposed stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE and that the coupled stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE. This forecasting aids in determining the future transmission paths of the virus.",
