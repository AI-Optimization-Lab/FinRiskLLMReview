  "title": "Influence of Micro Economic and Macro Economic on Yield to Maturity of Ijarah Sukuk Corporation Year 2014-2017",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to examine the influence of micro economic factor which is described with profitability and firm size, and macro economic factor which is described with BI -Rate and Inflation on the yield to maturity of sukuk ijarah. The yield to maturity of sukuk that will be received by investors illustrates the level of investor profit but the yield level also describes the level of risk borne by investors. This research is useful for investors in considering for profit and risk to be received. This research was conducted on all companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the 2014-2017 period which issued sukuk ijarah and published its financial statements during the study period. The research samples is 68 ijarah sukuk.The data analysis technique used in this study is panel data regression with fixed effect model. The results showed that profitability projected with Return on Asset and firm size did not affect to yield to maturity of sukuk ijarah, BI-Rate variable had a positive and significant effect on yield to maturity of sukuk",
