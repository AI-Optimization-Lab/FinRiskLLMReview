  "title": "Links of perceived economic deprivation to adolescents' well-being six years later",
  "abstract": "This study investigates long-lasting effects of perceived economic deprivation for adolescents' and young adults' well-being across a six-year time period. Furthermore, it is tested whether such effects differ for boys and girls, whether they can be traced back to earlier strain in wellbeing when deprivation was encountered, and whether maternal negativity mediates such reduced well-being. Data come from 358 adolescents who were interviewed with their mothers in 1996 and followed up until 2002. In 1996, economic deprivation was assessed as economic pressure experienced in the household economy (maternal report) and as adolescent-perceived financial hardship. Somatic complaints, self-esteem, and depressiveness were used as indicators of well-being in 1996 and 2002. Negative maternal communication was reported by adolescents in 1996. Findings from multiple regression analyses suggest weak but significant negative effects of earlier deprivation on later well-being, over and above effects of parental education and family structure. These effects were more pronounced for girls than for boys. Impaired wellbeing in 1996 explained much, but not all of the long-term effects of economic deprivation. Maternal negativity proved to be a stronger mediator for girls' reactions to economic stress. Overall the data suggest that economic deprivation in adolescence is a significant risk factor with long-term negative consequences particularly for girls.",
