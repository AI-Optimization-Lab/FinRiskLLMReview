  "title": "Socioeconomic and sex inequalities in chronic pain: A population-based cross-sectional study",
  "abstract": "ObjectiveWe investigated the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on chronic pain of older adults according to sex. Materials and methodsThis population-based cross-sectional study used survey data from the 2015 cohort of the SABE Study (Saude, Bem-estar e Envelhecimento), Brazil. Socioeconomic status was examined at individual level (educational attainment, financial independence, and race/skin color) and contextual level (Human Development Index). We analyzed the association between variables using the chi-square test and the Rao & Scott correction. Logistic regression models were adjusted for risk factors. ResultsThe study comprised 1,207 older adults representing 1,365,514 residents 60 >= years of age in the city of Sao Paulo. Chronic pain was more frequent in females (27.2%) than in males (14.5%) (p<0.001). Females evidenced the worst self-perception of pain, especially those of the most vulnerable socioeconomic strata. Social inequalities impacted chronic pain in different ways between sexes. Among females, unfavorable living conditions (OR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.07; 2,37) and Blacks/Browns females were most likely to have chronic pain (OR = 1.32; 95%CI 1.01; 1.74). Among males, only the individual aspects were significant for the occurrence of chronic pain, such as low educational attainment (OR = 1.88; 95%CI 1.16; 3.04) and insufficient income (OR = 1.63; 95%CI 1.01; 2.62). DiscussionThe potential for inequality was greater for females than for males reflecting structural factors inherent in a highly unequal society. Conclusions: Equity-oriented health policies are critical to preventing pain in human aging.",
