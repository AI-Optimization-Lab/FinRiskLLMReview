  "title": "Prospective risk factors for post-deployment heavy drinking and alcohol or substance use disorder among US Army soldiers",
  "abstract": "Background. Investigations of drinking behavior across military deployment cycles are scarce, and few prospective studies have examined risk factors for post-deployment alcohol misuse. Methods. Prevalence of alcohol misuse was estimated among 4645 US Army soldiers who participated in a longitudinal survey. Assessment occurred 1-2 months before soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 (T0), upon their return to the USA (T1), 3 months later (T2), and 9 months later (T3). Weights-adjusted logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of hypothesized risk factors with post-deployment incidence and persistence of heavy drinking (HD) (consuming 5 + alcoholic drinks at least 1-2x/week) and alcohol or substance use disorder (AUD/SUD). Results. Prevalence of past-month HD at T0, T2, and T3 was 23.3% (S.E. = 0.7%), 26.1% (S.E. = 0.8%), and 22.3% (S.E. = 0.7%); corresponding estimates for any binge drinking (BD) were 52.5% (S.E. = 1.0%), 52.5% (S.E. = 1.0%), and 41.3% (S.E. = 0.9%). Greater personal life stress during deployment (e.g., relationship, family, or financial problems) - but not combat stress - was associated with new onset of HD at T2 [per standard score increase: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.35, p = 0.003]; incidence of AUD/SUD at T2 (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.25-1.89, p < 0.0005); and persistence of AUD/SUD at T2 and T3 (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.08-1.56, p = 0.005). Any BD pre-deployment was associated with post-deployment onset of HD (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI 2.57-4.02, p < 0.0005) and AUD/SUD (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.27-2.70, p = 0.001). Conclusions. Alcohol misuse is common during the months preceding and following deployment. Timely intervention aimed at alleviating/managing personal stressors or curbing risky drinking might reduce risk of alcohol-related problems post-deployment.",
