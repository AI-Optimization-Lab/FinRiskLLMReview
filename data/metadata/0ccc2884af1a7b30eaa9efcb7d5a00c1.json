  "title": "Household income and county income inequality are associated with financial hardship among cancer survivors in New Jersey",
  "abstract": "Purpose To examine how household income and county income inequality are linked to financial hardship among cancer survivors. Methods Cancer survivors (n = 864) identified through the New Jersey State Cancer Registry were surveyed from August 2018 to January 2022. Local area income inequality was reflected by the Gini index a measure of income inequality at the county level. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, and the average marginal effect (AME) was calculated. Results Compared to survivors residing in households with income of $90,000 or more (higher income), those with household incomes between $50,000 and $89,999 (middle income) had a significantly higher risk of ever being unable to cover their share of the cost of cancer-related medical care (AME = .104, p = .001), higher risk of foregoing care in the past 12 months because of cost, including dental care (AME = .124, p < .001), eye care (AME = .082, p = .005), and mental health care or counseling (AME = .067, p = .002). An increase in the Gini index from the 25th to 75th percentile was associated with an increased risk of unmet needs in paying for follow-up care or medications related to cancer (AME = .021, p = .014) and an increased risk of foregoing doctor visits (AME = .017, p = .02) and eye care (AME = .03, p = .002) because of cost in the past 12 months. Conclusions Local area income inequality was associated with certain aspects of cancer survivors' experience of financial hardship.",
