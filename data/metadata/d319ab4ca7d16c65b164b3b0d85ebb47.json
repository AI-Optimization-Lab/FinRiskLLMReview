  "abstract": "This paper presents a research carried out on the achievement of competencies during the learning process in times of COVID-19 in Peruvian Basic Education, which has gone from a face-to-face modality to another of distance learning. For the variable achievement of competencies, four dimensions have been considered: cognitive, communicative, social and ethical. It was developed within the quantitative approach, its level was descriptive explanatory, of non-experimental design, transactional exploratory, applying a survey to 212 teachers of an educational network in Metropolitan Lima. The objective was to analyze the predominant factor that hinders the achievement of the prioritized competencies. Applying the logistic regression, from the teachers' perspective, it was possible to determine that the feedback (0.589) and the portfolio evaluation (0.694) are factors that hinder the achievement of competencies since they show significance values greater than the theoretical (alpha = 0.05), while the role of the family (0.00) does not hinder this achievement. The teacher, being a learning mediator, must promote the development of competencies. Factors such as feedback and evaluation of the evidence portfolio should have significance in his/her students; but in this research they are rather factors that are limiting the achievement of competencies.",
