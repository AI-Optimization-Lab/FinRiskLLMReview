  "title": "The application of Monte Carlo simulation in European call option pricing",
  "abstract": "Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method to solve the problem of option pricing. This article introduces the definition of option, the classification of option according to different standards and methods to evaluate the option. Then it focuses on the problem of how to use the method of Monte Carlo simulation to solve the option valuation of the European call option. Next it analyzes the algorithm of Wiener process, the algorithm of stock price model, and the algorithm of European call option. Finally it changes some parameters to observe its effect on option valuation. This series of steps show how to use the Monte Carlo simulation method to value the option in detail. After reading this article, even if a beginner can have a preliminary understanding of the options, and write some relevant programs based on this article.",
