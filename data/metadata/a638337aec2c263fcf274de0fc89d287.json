  "title": "Learning performance assessment approach using learning portfolio for e-learning systems",
  "abstract": "Learning performance assessment aims to evaluate what learners learnt during the learning process. In recent years, how to perform the learning performance assessment is a critical issue in the web-based learning field. The traditional summative evaluation can be applied to evaluate the learning performance both for the conventional classroom learning and web-based learning. However, it only considers final learning outcomes without considering the learning progress of learners. This paper proposes a learning performance assessment approach which combines four computational intelligence theories including grey relational analysis, K-means clustering method, fuzzy association rule mining and fuzzy inference to perform this task based on the learning portfolio of individual learner. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation result of proposed method is positive relevance with those of summative assessment. Namely, this method can help teachers to precisely perform the formative assessment for individual learner utilizing only the learning portfolio in web-based learning environment.",
