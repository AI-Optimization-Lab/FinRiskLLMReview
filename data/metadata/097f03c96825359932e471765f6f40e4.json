  "title": "Enterprise Financial Modeling Research based on Pattern Recognition Method",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to establish a set of accurate and useful financial early warning model for enterprises. In order to achieve this goal, theoretical analysis is combined with previous studies, on the basis of enterprise own characteristic, enterprise financial early warning index system of level 3 is put forward. BP neural network is used to predict financial risk, which is one kind of pattern recognition method. Samples are selected to train the neural network, and the testing samples are used for testing the trained network to verify the accuracy of the trained network. The empirical results confirm that the proposed enterprise financial early warning model can be quite effective for enterprise financial early warning.",
