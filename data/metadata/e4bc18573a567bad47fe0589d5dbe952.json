  "title": "Detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks in IOT Based Monitoring System of Banking Sector Using Machine Learning Models",
  "abstract": "Cyberattacks can trigger power outages, military equipment problems, and breaches of confidential information, i.e., medical records could be stolen if they get into the wrong hands. Due to the great monetary worth of the data it holds, the banking industry is particularly at risk. As the number of digital footprints of banks grows, so does the attack surface that hackers can exploit. This paper aims to detect distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks on financial organizations using the Banking Dataset. In this research, we have used multiple classification models for the prediction of DDOS attacks. We have added some complexity to the architecture of generic models to enable them to perform well. We have further applied a support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and random forest algorithms (RF). The SVM shows an accuracy of 99.5%, while KNN and RF scored an accuracy of 97.5% and 98.74%, respectively, for the detection of (DDoS) attacks. Upon comparison, it has been concluded that the SVM is more robust as compared to KNN, RF and existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches.",
