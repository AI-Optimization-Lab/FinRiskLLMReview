  "title": "MORTGAGE PRODUCT POLICY AND THE DEPENDENCE ON MACROECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE FIELD OF FINANCE",
  "abstract": "The significant problems of the banking sector after the Global Financial Crisis, which had been caused by a credit boom and a huge rise in real estate, has had effects on banking product policy, on the structure of mortgage portfolio, and marketing offer. The article describes the evolution and the structure of bank loans provided to households in a defined period. The aim of this paper is to analyze the development of mortgage product portfolio in the household sector and its dependence on selected macroeconomic factors in the context of local conditions. To fulfill the aim of this paper, multiple linear regression will be used. The basis for multiple linear regression is to estimate the effect of each independent variable Xi, represented by selected macroeconomic factors and dependent variable Y, represented by the volume of mortgages for private clients. Results of the analysis will be the basis for an estimate of the dependence of mortgage product portfolio on macroeconomic factors in context of local finance regulations.",
