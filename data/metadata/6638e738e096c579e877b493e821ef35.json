  "title": "Pricing D-dimensional Real Portfolio Options Effect of Many-valued Logic Janusian Thinking on Optimal Investment Decisions",
  "abstract": "This work introduces a valuation framework for an option on d real portfolios with price processes for which the martingale assumption does not hold. The model describes how an option holder having imprecise estimates for the portfolio price processes can arrive at single valued estimates using human information processing approaches. A regression-based numerical option-pricing method allows assessing the value of the resulting optimal stopping decisions embedded in the option valuation problem. Theoretical predictions concerning the influence of differences in information processing styles are evaluated in a simulative example. A high tolerance for contraction in information processing modeled using fuzzy set theory does not lead to superior investment decisions.",
