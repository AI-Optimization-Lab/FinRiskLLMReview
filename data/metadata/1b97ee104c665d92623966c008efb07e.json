  "title": "A Platform for Evaluating RD&I Projects Considering Intangible Gains in Energy Industry",
  "abstract": "This article details a proposed platform for the selection and classification of Research, Development and Innovation (RD&I) projects, in the context of the Energy Industry in Brazil, considering gains in terms of intangible assets for a given company. For this, the platform consists of a model structured in two parts. The first part (Part I) identifies the project's contribution estimated for a company's intangible assets portfolio, via trial project alignment with strategic demands elected by the company. In Part II, the platform aims to determine, in addition to the metrics traditionally used, e.g. NPV and IRR, the project's maturity level, through a designed classification typology, which is based on the value of the call option and NPV of the project cash flow. Our expectation is that the adoption of the proposed platform collaborates for the adoption of active management of RD&I projects' portfolio.",
