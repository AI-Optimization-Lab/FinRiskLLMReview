  "abstract": "This paper examines the issues related to the competition between two currencies in an agent-based computational economic model. The economic environment is a two-country overlapping generations economy with no restrictions on foreign currency holdings. Governments of both countries finance their deficits via seignorage. Agents make decisions about their savings and portfolio decisions. They use the genetic algorithm to update their decision rules. The results presented in the paper show that the currency of the country that finances larger of the two deficits becomes valueless. The adjustment process is characterized by a flight away from the currency used to finance the larger of the two deficits. The economy converges to a stationary equilibrium that corresponds to a single-currency economy. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classification. D84; E42; F31.",
