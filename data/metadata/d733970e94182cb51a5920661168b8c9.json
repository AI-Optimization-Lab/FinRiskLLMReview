  "abstract": "This paper tests the hypothesis that price discovery influences asset pricing. Our innovations are twofold. First, we estimate time-varying price discovery for a large number (21) of Islamic stock portfolios. Second, we test using. a predictive regression model whether or not price discovery predicts stock excess returns. We find from both in-sample and out-of-sample tests that all 21 portfolio excess returns are predictable. We show that a mean-variance investor by tracking price discovery is able to devise profitable trading strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
