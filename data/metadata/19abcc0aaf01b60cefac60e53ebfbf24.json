  "title": "Awareness of the Risk of Chronic Use of Steroid Causing Cataract in Al Ahsa City, Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "Introduction The lens, essential for vision, can be impaired by cataracts, leading to partial or complete reversible vision loss. Common risk factors include aging, diabetes, and steroid use, with significant financial implications. Limited awareness in Saudi Arabia necessitates further research to reduce cataract prevalence and increase knowledge about steroid -induced cataracts. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study in Al Ahsa City, Saudi Arabia that aims to assess awareness of cataracts induced by long-term steroid use. Data was collected via an online survey and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results Our study results show that 69.8% (n=291) of participants were female, and 30.2% (n=126) were male, with the majority (62.6%, n=261) having a university education. Notably, 91.1% (n=380) reported no steroid use, while 8.9% (n=37) reported long-term use, and 10.1% (n=42) used steroids topically. There are moderate awareness levels regarding cataract and steroid associations, with 68.1% (n=284) recognizing topical steroids as the common culprits. Logistic regression highlighted the positive correlation between knowledge of cataract risks due to steroid use and actual steroid use, corroborated by a notable 73.0% (n=27) steroid usage among high -awareness individuals. Conclusion Our study underscores moderate awareness regarding steroid -related cataract risks in Al Ahsa City. Educational status significantly influenced understanding, highlighting the importance of targeted health education initiatives.",
