  "title": "THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL LITERACY ON INDIVIDUAL SAVING: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY IN THE MALAYSIAN CONTEXT",
  "abstract": "This study examines the influence of financial literacy on individual saving in the context of an emerging market, Malaysia. A survey was conducted on approximately 200 individuals in Klang Valley, Malaysia to study the relationship under investigation. Other determinants of individual saving were also examined, in particular, saving regularity, risk-taking behaviour, and socio-demographic characteristics. Results of a Probit regression revealed that the level of financial literacy had a significant, positive impact on individual saving. In addition, saving regularity, gender, income and educational level influenced the probability of saving positively. Results of this study suggest that it is important for policymakers to increase financial literacy of households by implementing various financial education programmes, to further influence saving rates at the national level.",
