  "abstract": "ObjectiveTo examine self-reported financial strain in relation to pharmacy utilization adherence data. Data Sources/Study SettingSurvey, administrative, and electronic medical data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Study DesignRetrospective cohort design (2006, n=7,773). Data Collection/Extraction MethodsWe compared survey self-reports of general and medication-specific financial strain to three adherence outcomes from pharmacy records, specifying adjusted generalized linear regression models. Principal FindingsEight percent and 9 percent reported general and medication-specific financial strain. In adjusted models, general strain was significantly associated with primary nonadherence (RR=1.37; 95 percent CI: 1.04-1.81) and refilling late (RR=1.34; 95 percent CI: 1.07-1.66); and medication-specific strain was associated with primary nonadherence (RR=1.42, 95 percent CI: 1.09-1.84). ConclusionsSimple, minimally intrusive questions could be used to identify patients at risk of poor adherence due to financial barriers.",
