  "title": "The Improved ClusterSVM for Large Scale Classification Set to Credit Risk Evaluation",
  "abstract": "Credit risk evaluation has been the major focus of financial and banking industry due to recent financial crises and regulatory concern of Basel II regulations. In this paper, we experiment with an improved ClusterSVM to Credit risk evaluation. ClusterSVM exploiting the distributional properties of training data accelerates the training process with large-scale data set. The algorithm first partition the training data into disjoint clusters, then train an initial SVM using representatives of these clusters. This initial SVM gives us a global picture of the solution. Based on initial SVM can approximately identify the support vectors and non-support vectors. The training process is accelerated by replacing non-support vectors with few data. The initial support vectors of cluster is the key of training ClusterSVM. This paper proposed an improved ClusterSVM which obtains the initial support vectors efficiently. Computational results indicate computational times, as well as the number of training data, are much smaller for improved method than that of a conventional ClusterSVM in process of credit risk evaluation.",
