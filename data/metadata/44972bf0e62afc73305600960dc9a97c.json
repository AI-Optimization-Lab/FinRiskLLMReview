  "title": "Drinking-water quality surveillance in the municipal context: contours, challenges and possibilities",
  "abstract": "The magnitude of drinking-water quality surveillance (DWQS) attributions in meeting its primary function of health protection, associated with the heterogeneity of Brazilian municipalities (demographic and epidemiological profile, human and financial resources), is an important challenge in implementing actions which are effective and sustainable at the local level. The study presents the experience in rolling out the national operation model for DWQS in a small municipality in Minas Gerais state. The paper whether the strategic and basic actions and the doctrinal, organizational and executive principles provided in the operation model were achieved and how they were accomplished. Also, certain strategies for confronting the challenges imposed by DWQS assignment were presented. The existence of a well prepared and measured professional team is a fundamental aspect in achieving the DWQS objectives. In addition, some procedures should have clear guidelines, such as the integrated analysis of information systems and analysis and health risk classification of water supplies. In conclusion, different challenges must be overcome to implement drinking-water quality surveillance at the local level and managers could experience some difficulties. Federal level managers should be aware of issues that require more detailed and specific treatment.",
