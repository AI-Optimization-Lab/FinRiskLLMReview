  "title": "A Bibliometric Analysis of Project Management Research",
  "abstract": "Our study employs quantitative bibliometric techniques including citation and co-citation analysis through social network realisation and Gephi clustering of articles from the Project Management Journal published by Project Management Institute (PMI). We identified the core themes to be Project Success/Failure, Portfolio/Programme Management, Knowledge Management, Qualitative Research, Complex Projects, Project Leadership and Best Practice. Our analysis shows that the majority of the literature is still academic in nature, and there is room for researchers to conduct future studies that is of more practiced-based relevant. However, the topics we discern suggest the start of divergence away from the PMI BoK (PMBOK) and researchers are developing tools which manage the specific issues in this information's age.",
