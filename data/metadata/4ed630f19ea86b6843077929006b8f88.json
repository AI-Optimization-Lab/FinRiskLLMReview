  "title": "Financial Risk Analytics based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network",
  "abstract": "A company's financial risk warning is particularly important, since the risk of non-life insurance industry is diversified. In order to forecast the financial condition of non-life insurance company, a complete set of financial risk index evaluation system is constructed from the aspects of solvency, profitability and growth ability. The entropy method is used to objectively evaluate the index. The forecasting and warning model is established based on the Radial Basis Function Neural Network. Then taking the data of a non-life insurance company in 20132015 as the sample, the financial risk is measured and evaluated. The results show that the prediction error rate of the Radial Basis Function Neural Network model is less than 10% It can accurately predict the financial risk of non-life insurance company.",
