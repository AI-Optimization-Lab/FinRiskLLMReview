  "abstract": "Objectives There Continues to be a debate about the long-term prognosis of psychiatric treatment of depression in later life There have been no long-term naturalistic studies of psychiatric outpatient treatment of older adults in the United States This Study examines outcome and predictors of various levels of depression among a biracial sample of geropsychiatric Outpatients in Brooklyn, NY Methods We conducted a naturalistic Study (median 33 months) of 143 persons aged 55 and over with diagnoses of depression drawn from 15 psychiatry outpatient clinics and 2 geriatric day programs Their mean age was 68 years, 87% were female, and 43% were white and 57% were black, among whom 37% were African Caribbeans Using George's Social Antecedent Model of Depression, we examined the impact of 15 predictor variables or two Outcome measures presence Of ally either subclinical or clinical depression (CES-D score >= 8) and presence of clinical depression (CES-D score >= 16). Results On follow-up, 84% and 90% Of subclinically and clinically depressed persona at baseline, respectively, were depressed (CES-D >= 8), 62% of those in remission at baseline were depressed In logistic regression, 3 variables were significant predictors of any level of depression on follow-tip baseline depression, baseline anxiety, greater increase in anxiety symptoms during the follow-up period These 3 variables along with financial strain were significant predictors of clinical depression on follow-up There were no inter- or intra-racial differences in outcome Conclusions The bleak outcome findings among older psychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn were consistent With unfavorable results reported in European Studies Because there were only a few predictors Of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons - ea., Such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress - may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved",
