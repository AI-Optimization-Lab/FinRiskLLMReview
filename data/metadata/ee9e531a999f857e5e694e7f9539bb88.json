  "title": "Risk Factors for Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Critically Ill Patients With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
  "abstract": "Background: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are preventable adverse outcomes that cause increased morbidity, mortality, and financial burdens to hospitals. These are particularly prevalent in intensive care units (ICUs). Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in neurological ICUs have extended lengths of stay and may be at higher risk for CAUTIs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of and risk factors for CAUTIs among patients with SAH in the neurological ICU of a large urban teaching hospital in the eastern United States. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis using the Columbia University SAH Outcomes Project data set collected between 2005 and 2012. Logistic regression is used to identify predictors of CAUTI. Results: Catheterized adult patients (n = 242) with SAH over the 8-year period were included. The rate of CAUTIs was 20.7 per 1,000 catheter days, six times higher than the reported national average. Variables significantly associated with CAUTI were older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.01, 1.11]), blood sugar > 200 mg/dl (OR = 13.0, 95% CI [1.28, 107.4]), and anemia requiring transfusion (OR = 3.78, 95% CI [0.977, 14.67]). Conclusions: Higher CAUTI rates in this study were likely associated with prolonged catheterization. On the basis of these findings, careful assessment of the need for catheterization and increased vigilance regarding urinary catheter care in patients with SAH is indicated, particularly among those who are older, with anemia requiring transfusion and elevated blood glucose levels.",
