  "title": "Advantages of credit scoring models in loan applicants evaluation",
  "abstract": "Credit risk evaluation is an important problem in financial analysis domain. Many statistical classification methods have been suggested in the literature to solve this problem. Several techniques like discriminant analysis, logistics regression, neural networks etc. have been used for credit rating. In this article advantages for banks of using credit scoring models are described.",
