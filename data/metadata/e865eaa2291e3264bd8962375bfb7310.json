  "title": "Determinant Factors of the Capital Structure of Brazilian Companies: Evidence from the Public Utility Sector",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the determinants of short (ECP) and long-term (ELP) indebtedness of companies in the Public Utility sector in Brazil, in the light of the pecking order and trade-off theories. The methodology used was the multiple regression analysis with panel data for the period from 2008 to 2017, using ECP and EPL as dependent variables; and profitability, risk, size, current liquidity index, growth and tangibility as independent variables. The sample consisted of 55 companies, whose data were extracted from the Bloomberg financial information platform. In the results, it was pointed out that, for the ELP, only the profitability and growth variables were relevant for determining the capital structure of companies, while the risk factors, size, liquidity index and tangibility were not. With regard to the ECP, the variables profitability, risk, liquidity index and growth were significant while size and tangibility were not. For all cases, the observed relationships were negative, therefore, sometimes compatible with the trade-off theory, sometimes with the pecking order.",
