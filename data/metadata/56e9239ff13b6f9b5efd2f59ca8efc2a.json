  "title": "Feasibility of implementing a same-day electronic screening tool for clinical assessment to measure patient-reported outcomes for eliciting actionable information on adherence to HIV medication and related factors in a busy Canadian urban HIV clinic",
  "abstract": "Background: An optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is fundamental for suppression of HIV viral load and favourable treatment outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are effective tools for improving patient-provider communication and focusing providers' awareness on current health problems. The objectives of this analysis were (1) to determine the feasibility of implementing an electronic screening tool to measure PROs in a Canadian HIV clinic to obtain information on ART adherence and related factors and (2) to determine the factors related to sub-optimal adherence. Methods: This implementation research with a convenience sample of 600 people living with HIV (PLWH) was conducted in a busy, academic, urban HIV clinic in Toronto, Canada. PLWH were approached to participate in PRO assessments just prior to their in-clinic appointments, including health-related domains such as mental health, housing, nutrition, financial stress and medication adherence, and responses were summarized on a single sheet available for providers to review. Feasibility of implementing PROs was assessed by quantifying response rate, completion rate, time taken and participation rate. Medication adherence was elicited by self-report of the percentage of prescribed HIV medications taken in the last month. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were estimated from logistic regression models to identify factors associated with adherence of <95%. Results: Of the 748 PLWH invited to participate, 692 (participation rate: 92.5%) completed the PRO assessments as standard of care in clinic. Of these, 600 consented to the use of their PRO results for research and were included in this analysis. The average response rate to the ART-related questions was 96.8% and mean completion rate was 95.5%. The median time taken to complete the assessment was 12.0 (IQR = 8.4-17.3) min, adjusted 8.7 (IQR = 7.2-10.8) min. 445 (74.9%) of participants were male, and 153 (26.2%) reported dissatisfaction with ART. 105 (19.7%) of the PLWH reported ART adherence of <95%. Multivariable logistic regression identified the following risk factors for sub-optimal adherence: dissatisfaction with ART (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.38-3.83), not having a family doctor or not visiting a family doctor in last year (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.79). Conclusion: Collecting self-reported health information from PLWH through PROs in a busy urban clinic was feasible and can provide relevant information to healthcare providers on issues related to adherence. This has a potential to help in individualizing ambulatory care.",
