  "title": "On a Spread Model for Portfolio Credit Risk Modeling",
  "abstract": "We propose a model for determining the spread of a credit portfolio based on the actuarial principle. In this model the spread is a function of the recovery rate and of the probability of default. In an application to data, from a consumer credit portfolio of a Cape Verde bank, we estimate the recovery rate by a beta regression and the probability of default by a logistic regression, both regressions using as independent variables sociodemographic information and consumer credit contract variables in the data set. We show that the data support the possibility of defining a spread for each client - the borrower - that is coherent with the portfolio spread given by the model.",
