  "title": "CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF SMES IN THE SERVICE SECTOR IN GUAYAQUIL DURING 2011 - 2016",
  "abstract": "It is vital for companies to plan financial resources, to be able to handle present and future commitments in a solvent manner. In the case of SMEs, the focus has been on finding models that increase the productivity of assets, ignoring an adequate definition of their financial structure. The purpose of this research is to analyze the capital structure of service SMEs in the city of Guayaquil and how it impacts their profitability indexes. The population is made up of 2,972 SMEs, for a sample of 340 companies. The source of information is the Superintendence of Companies, Securities and Insurance of Ecuador, together with direct observation in two selected companies and open interviews. The capital structure of SMEs shows a varied behavior of the weighted average cost of capital from 2011 to 2016, with bank loans and, to a lesser extent, equity being determining factors. According to the regression analysis, all the explanatory variables (risk, growth, asset structure, profitability, age and size) are significant at any level with respect to the debt rate (short-term and long-term), showing the strength and direction of correlation levels.",
