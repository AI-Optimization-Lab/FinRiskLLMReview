  "title": "SPECIAL RADWASTE MANAGEMENT PROSPECTS",
  "abstract": "The initial registration brought to light the characteristics and disposition of wastes that should be disposed of on-site (special radioactive wastes). The criteria for validating the classification of radwastes as special are presented. The established criteria for the origin of wastes and the location of an object and its sanitaryprotective zone do not permit classifying the radwastes of certain large objects as special even though their removal is unjustified both in terms of dose loads and the risk of potential radiation as well as in terms of financial cost. Criteria are proposed for storage sites for special radwastes for inclusion in the developed regulatory documents, regulating their safe operation and transfer to accommodation and storage sites.",
