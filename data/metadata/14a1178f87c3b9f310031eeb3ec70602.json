  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and risk factors for ejaculation failure on the day of operation in Chinese men undergoing assisted reproductive technique (ART) treatments. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of 843 men undergoing ART treatments at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Surveys included age, BMI, education, duration of marriage, duration of infertility, smoking, type of infertility, infertility causes, history of ejaculation failure, financial burden of the treatment, anxiety, and whether ejaculation failure happened during obtainment of sperm samples by masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval or operation for intrauterine insemination. Their anxiety statuses were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for ejaculation failure. RESULTS: On the day of operation 70 (8.3%) men undergoing ART treatments had ejaculation failure. The risk factors for ejaculation failure are a history of ejaculation failure (OR=12.29, 95% CI 6.98-21.64) and state of anxiety (OR=1.90, 95% CI 1.13-3.20). CONCLUSION: History of ejaculation failure and state of anxiety are associated with an increased risk for ejaculation failure on the day of operation.",
