  "abstract": "The escalating burden of nosocomial infections presents a formidable challenge to healthcare systems worldwide, leading to increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and elevated healthcare costs. These infections are often resistant to conventional antibiotic therapies due to their association with biofilms which contribute to the persistence and resistance of pathogens. In addressing the challenge of biofilm-associated nosocomial infections, borate bioactive glasses (BBGs) have emerged as promising biomaterials. Doping these glasses with antimicrobial metals could potentially harness their antibacterial properties to prevent biofilm formation. This study undertakes a rigorous evaluation of the anti-biofilm efficacy of copper and zinc-doped BBGs by employing processed imaging techniques and machine learning algorithms that allow for the in-depth analysis of biofilms. The study focused on three bacterial species known for their prevalence in nosocomial infections and propensity to form biofilms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results indicated a marked reduction in biofilm viability and morphological disruptions upon treatment with copper and zinc-doped BBGs, highlighting their potential as a novel approach to combatting the persistent challenge of nosocomial infections. Statement of significance: The persistent challenge of nosocomial infections within healthcare facilities underscores a pressing need for innovative strategies aimed at mitigating the risk and spread of these infections. Nosocomial infections not only result in significant morbidity and mortality among patients but also impose a heavy financial burden on healthcare systems due to increased treatment costs and extended hospital stays. The complexity of combating these infections is further compounded by the biofilm-forming capabilities of many pathogenic bacteria, which can adhere to a wide range of surfaces, including medical devices and surgical equipment. In this context, the development and application of copper and zinc-doped BBGs (Cu/Zn-BBGs) represent a novel and promising approach to preventing biofilm-associated nosocomial infections. The incorporation of antimicrobial metal ions into the BBG matrix offers a dual-functional strategy: enhancing the inherent bioactive properties of the glasses while introducing potent antimicrobial activity against biofilms. This innovative approach lies on the gradual and complete release of copper and zinc ions from the BBG into the surrounding environment, targeting biofilms at their initial formation stages and disrupting their development. The antimicrobial mechanism of these metal ions, which includes disruption of bacterial cell walls, alteration of DNA replication, and inhibition of metabolic processes, provides broad-spectrum activity against a variety of pathogens that cause nosocomial infections. The novelty of this research also lies in its methodological approach, particularly the use of processed microscopic images for the detailed analysis of the anti-biofilm effectiveness of the BBGs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) image analysis is a pivotal tool used in this study, allowing for the in-depth visualization and quantitative analysis of biofilm structures. CLSM's capability to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional images of biofilms in situ enables the precise assessment of the antibiofilm efficacy of Cu/Zn-BBGs. Moreover, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for both qualitative and quantitative analysis provided pivotal information on the biofilms' structural characteristics and surface interaction.",
