  "title": "Identification of Enterprise Financial Risk Based on Clustering Algorithm",
  "abstract": "In order to solve the problem that corporate financial risks seriously affect the healthy development of enterprises, credit institutions, securities investors, and even the whole of China, the K-means clustering algorithm, the risk screening process, and the Gaussian mixture clustering algorithm, the risk screening process, are proposed; experiments have shown that although the number of high-risk companies selected by the K-means algorithm is small, only 9% of the full sample, the high-risk cluster can contain nearly 30% of the new special treatment companies. If the time period is extended to the next 5 years, this proportion will be higher. Finally we found that if the prediction of special handling events is used as the criterion for evaluating high-risk clusters, then K-means clustering can effectively screen out those risky companies that need to be treated with caution by investors. The validity of the experiment is verified.",
