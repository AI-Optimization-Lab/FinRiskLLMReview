  "title": "SAVINGS IN POLISH SENIORS' HOUSEHOLDS",
  "abstract": "The main objective of the paper is the analysis of saving portfolio of the households of Polish seniors over 50 years old. To achieve this aim, the classification of Polish seniors' households based on the composition of their saving portfolio was conducted. The data used in the analysis comes from the Social Diagnosis. By using cluster analysis 4 types of older people's households were distinguished: saving in cash (46%), saving in banks and avoiding cash (26%), saving in banks and in cash (25%), diversified (3%). Households of older people in Poland use mainly safe savings products, that do not require much involvement. Almost half of surveyed households of seniors accumulates they savings only in the form of cash.",
