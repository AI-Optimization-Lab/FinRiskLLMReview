  "title": "THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN THE POST-PANDEMIC ERA",
  "abstract": "In order to protect workers from possible difficulties that may arise in the development of their professional activities, the social security system functions as a right that belongs to all employees. One of its functions is to provide insurance coverage in the event of work-related accidents or occupational diseases. In recent years, this coverage has been extended to cover immediate family members. However, the 2020 pandemic has highlighted some regulatory gaps that may have an impact on workers' rights, particularly with regard to the COVID-19 case and the classification of occupational diseases. Many health care workers who were directly exposed to the virus died or became disabled without being able to apply for a financial settlement from the Social Security Administration. This research has examined this situation, paying special attention to article 6 of Resolution CD 513 of the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security and the Basic Norms of the Occupational Risk Insurance System.",
