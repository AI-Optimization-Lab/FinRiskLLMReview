  "title": "The Financial Pre-warning Research of Real Estate Company Based on Logistic model - Economic Data of 114 Real Estate listed Companies in China from 2012 to 2014",
  "abstract": "The financial early-warning is very important for real estate listed companies to guard against financial risk correctly and to promote sustainable development. The paper uses non-parameter test based on 20financial ratios, in order to find financial ratios which can significantly identify the different between ST and non-ST companies. And then it studies the financial early-warning for real estate listed company based on logistic regression model by using the SPSS software. The results show that the model based on logistic regression model is of good effect, and has good predictive accuracy.",
