  "title": "Predicting SMT Solver Performance for Software Verification",
  "abstract": "The Why3 IDE and verification system facilitates the use of a wide range of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers through a driver-based architecture. We present Where4 : a portfolio-based approach to discharge Why3 proof obligations. We use data analysis and machine learning techniques on static metrics derived from program source code. Our approach benefits software engineers by providing a single utility to delegate proof obligations to the solvers most likely to return a useful result. It does this in a time-efficient way using existing Why3 and solver installations - without requiring low-level knowledge about SMT solver operation from the user.",
