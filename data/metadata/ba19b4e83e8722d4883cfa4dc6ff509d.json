  "abstract": "The level of moral development and moral intensity in cognitive psychology will not only affect the ethical behavior of accountants, but also have a direct impact on the quality and level of accounting work. Therefore, in this paper, the ethical behavior of accountants was analyzed from the perspective of cognitive psychology. Computer-aided data mining techniques were introduced, and government accounting risk assessment management of financial accountants was studied. In this paper, the principle of cognitive psychology to measure the ethical level of accountants was first described. The predicament of moral judgments was analyzed and an optimization plan to improve the ethical intention of accountants was proposed. Support Vector Machine classification technology in data mining was studied to explore how to conduct effective and reliable evaluation, so as to provide a scientific basis for decision-making in improving accounting management. After the simulation experiment, it is proved that continuously improving the ethical standards of accountants and strengthening the forecast of accounting risks can continue to optimize the accounting office management.
