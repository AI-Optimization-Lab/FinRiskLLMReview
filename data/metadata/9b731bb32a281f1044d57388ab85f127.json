  "title": "Research on Credit Risk Appraisement of Chinese Commercial banks",
  "abstract": "A series of abnormal alteration of macro-economic and financial indexes often causes the credit risk of banks. The paper selects nine indexes containing three aspects. Firstly, it works out the factors' score and the credit risk index of each aspect. And then, carries through the regression analysis and finds out the most influent factors of credit risk of commercial banks.",
