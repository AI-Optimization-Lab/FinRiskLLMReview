  "abstract": "This paper based on fuzzy clustering model to rank scores is used to evaluate high-tech small and micro enterprises financing credit risk. According to the index weight of the resulting weight value, analyzing the impact results. Determine level indicators include high-tech small and micro enterprise financing characteristics, operational risk, credit risk, financial services risk, legal and reputation risk, and refined based on level indicators of secondary indicators, finally get fuzzy evaluation results: Z= (0.31 0.25 0.19 0.16 0.09)",
