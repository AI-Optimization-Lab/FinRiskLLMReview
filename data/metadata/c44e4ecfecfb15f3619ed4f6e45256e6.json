  "title": "Geriatric depression: prevalence and its associated factors in rural Odisha",
  "abstract": "The world's population is aging rapidly, and the epidemiological transition has led to increased mental disorders worldwide. Geriatric depression is masked by multiple comorbidities or the natural process of aging. Our study aims to estimate the prevalence of geriatric depression and find the risk factors associated with geriatric depression in rural Odisha. The study was a multistage cross-sectional study conducted in the Tangi block, district Khordha, Odisha, from August 2020 to September 2022, among 520 participants selected by probability proportional to size sampling. From the selected participants, eligible 479 older adults were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule, Hindi Mini Mental Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale-15, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The step forward multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associated factors of depression among older adults. Among our participants, 44.4% (213) of older adults were depressed. Substance abuse in family members [AOR: 16.7 (9.1-30.9)], history of elder abuse [AOR: 3.7 (2.1-6.7)], physical dependency [AOR: 2.2 (1.3-3.6)], and financial dependency [AOR: 2.2 (1.3-3.6)] are significant independent risk factors associated with geriatric depression. Living with children [AOR: 0.33 (0.18-0.59)] and recreational activity [AOR: 0.54 (0.34-0.85)] are significant protective factors of geriatric depression. Our study found that geriatric depression is highly prevalent in rural Odisha. Poor quality of family life and physical and financial dependency was found to be the most significant risk factor for geriatric depression.",
