  "title": "The risk factors of psychosocial problems for burn patients",
  "abstract": "Many burn patients experience psychosocial problems such as personality change, posttraumatic stress disorder, family trouble, and financial burden. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors of these psychosocial problems that prevented burn patients from developing appropriate adjustments after burn. Six hundred eighty-six adult burn inpatients were interviewed. Most of them suffered from burns less than 10% of total body surface area. They were asked to fill in a questionnaire for this study, which was a psychosocial problem checklist of 17 items. Descriptive analysis, factor analysis, Chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. Lack of family support and living expense burden were the two significant risk factors for psychosocial problems including, burn treatment problems, rehabilitation problems, and welfare information problems on both acute and chronic burn patients. Medical expense burden was the risk factor among chronic burn patients. These findings suggested that active interventions by the burn team including mental health professionals (psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker) might reduce psychosocial problems of burn patients and encourage social rehabilitation.
