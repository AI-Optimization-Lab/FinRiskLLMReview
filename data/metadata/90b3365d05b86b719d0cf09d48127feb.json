  "title": "Risk classifiers and generalized perceptrons",
  "abstract": "Risk classification of financial institutions is analyzed in the case where several risk classes are present. It is shown that the classical scoring systems (simple perceptrons) may no longer provide sufficient storage capacity in this case (no matter which learning algorithm is employed). Hence a generalized version of the perceptron, which increases storage capacity is considered. If is argued that the resulting advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Preliminary experimental results are discribed which indicate that the proposed method, in spire of theoretical shortcomings, is eminently suitable for practical purposes. More extensive tests with realistic data (which are hard to come by) are proposed to verify the claim.",
