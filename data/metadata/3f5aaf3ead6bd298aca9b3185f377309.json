  "title": "Does Consumer Credit Precede or Follow Changes in Cognitive Impairment Among Older Adults? An Investigation in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Trial",
  "abstract": "ObjectivesWe assessed the relationships between pre- and post-morbid consumer credit history (credit scores, debts unpaid, or in collections) and classification of mild (or greater) cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsGeneralized Estimating Equation models assessed pre-and post-morbid credit history and MCI risk among 1740 participants aged 65+ in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study, linked to TransUnion consumer credit data.ResultsEach 50-point increase in credit score was associated with up to 8% lower odds of MCI in the next 3 years. In contrast, new unpaid collections over doubled the odds of having MCI in the next 3 years. MCI was associated with subsequent credit score declines and a 47%-71% greater risk of having a new unpaid collection in the next 4 years.DiscussionCredit declines may signal risk for future MCI. MCI may lead to financial challenges that warrant credit monitoring interventions for older adults.",
