  "abstract": "Enterprise finance has become an indispensable financial channel for people to invest in their lives, and business management can provide a better economic environment for the development of enterprise finance. The structure of enterprises is gradually becoming more and more complex, and business administration shoulders considerable responsibilities and obligations in the organization and supervision of today's social management structure. How can China play its functions under the new situation after the world economic exchanges are more frequent is an important link to promote the stable development of financial markets. In view of the problems of economic activity behavior and certainty of financial index system under the background of existing business administration, this paper puts forward the deep learning model to make risk analysis, income analysis, profit and loss analysis, and so on. The formula of deep learning model is used to calculate the data graph of financial economy, and finally, various data are compared to get the research of several business management methods on the development of enterprise financial economy. Among them, the model of current management mode belongs to two modes: e-commerce and EPR management. They not only have very unique management characteristics but also greatly promote the development of modern management, and their roles also well interpret the characteristics of modern management. The experiment also analyzes the financial data under the four algorithms for uncertainty comparison, profit and loss comparison, discreteness comparison, volatility comparison, and possibility analysis. Finally, after the source of uncertainty, the risk prediction and risk management are carried out by constructing decision trees, and these structural models are used to bring comprehensive analysis to the financial economy of enterprises and to build the impact of good trends and development prospects.",
