  "title": "Navigating mental health risks among Australian military Veterans: Insights for general practice",
  "abstract": "This study explores mental health risks among Australian military Veterans, emphasizing the critical role of health care practitioners, particularly general practitioners (GPs), in promptly identifying and effectively managing mental health concerns among this population. Through an analysis of data from 150 injured Veterans, research revealed that individuals with shorter service length, those with lower rank, males who underwent voluntary discharge, and females who experienced involuntary medical discharge are at heightened risk of developing a service-related mental health condition. The study highlights the urgent need for early intervention, as Veterans often delay seeking help for their service-related injuries until they reach a crisis point, long after service has ended. Despite Veterans regularly relying on GP services, many GPs lack awareness of the Veterans in their practice and the unique challenges they experience. Educating GPs about specific mental health risk factors related to service is imperative to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. The study recommends establishing financial incentives to encourage GPs to develop the necessary military cultural competence and integrating relevant content into university curricula. Introduction: Between 40% and 60% of military Veterans who experience mental health problems are not seeking the formal help they need. However, the use of general practitioner (GP) services by the Veteran population is estimated to be above 85%, indicating the crucial role GPs play in the early identification and treatment of those with mental health problems. This study aims to identify risk factors that contribute to Veterans developing a service-related mental health condition in order to inform GPs, who often serve as Veterans' primary health care providers. Methods: Intake questionnaire responses from Veterans seeking advocacy support services from the South Australian Returned & Services League (N = 150) were cross-tabulated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine mental health and physical injury types against the variables of biological sex, discharge, deployment, rank, service length, and support delay. Results: Short service length, junior rank, being male and voluntarily discharged, and being female and involuntarily medically discharged were associated with an increased risk of developing a mental health condition. Discussion: Investment by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and health authorities is needed to mitigate the barriers GPs face in developing the military cultural competence to improve the health care provided to the Veteran population and minimize missed opportunities for early intervention. Introduction : De 40 % & agrave; 60 % des v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s militaires qui & eacute;prouvent des probl & egrave;mes de sant & eacute; mentale ne cherchent pas & agrave; obtenir l'aide officielle dont ils et elles ont besoin. Cependant, on estime que plus de 85 % de la population de v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s recourent aux services d'un(e) praticien(ne) g & eacute;n & eacute;ral(e) (PG), ce qui d & eacute;montre le r & ocirc;le capital des PG pour la d & eacute;tection pr & eacute;coce et le traitement des personnes qui ont des probl & egrave;mes de sant & eacute; mentale. Cette & eacute;tude vise & agrave; d & eacute;terminer quels facteurs de risque contribuent & agrave; l'apparition d'un trouble de sant & eacute; mentale li & eacute; au service militaire chez les v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s afin d'& eacute;clairer les PG qui sont souvent les fournisseurs de soins de sant & eacute; primaires des v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s. M & eacute;thodologie : Les r & eacute;ponses au questionnaire d'admission des v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s qui ont demand & eacute; des services de d & eacute;fense des int & eacute;r & ecirc;ts aupr & egrave;s de la South Australian Returned & Services League (ligue de retours et de services du sud de l'Australie; n = 150) ont fait l'objet d'une analyse crois & eacute;e. L'analyse de r & eacute;gression logistique a permis d'examiner la sant & eacute; mentale et le type de l & eacute;sions physique par rapport aux variables du sexe biologique, du cong & eacute;, du d & eacute;ploiement, du rang, de la dur & eacute;e de service et du d & eacute;lai avant d'obtenir un soutien. R & eacute;sultats : La courte dur & eacute;e du service, le rang junior, le sexe masculin et le cong & eacute; volontaire, de m & ecirc;me que le sexe f & eacute;minin et le cong & eacute; m & eacute;dical involontaire, & eacute;taient associ & eacute;s & agrave; un risque accru de trouble de sant & eacute; mentale. Discussion : Il faut que le minist & egrave;re des Anciens combattants et les autorit & eacute;s sanitaires investissent pour r & eacute;duire les obstacles & agrave; l'acquisition des comp & eacute;tences culturelles des militaires qu'affrontent les PG pour am & eacute;liorer les soins & agrave; la population de v & eacute;t & eacute;ran(e)s et limiter les occasions rat & eacute;es d'intervenir rapidement.",
