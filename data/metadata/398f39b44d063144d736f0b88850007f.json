  "title": "A financial risk identification model based on artificial intelligence",
  "abstract": "Financial management issues affect companies, and there have been many articles describing examples of companies that have suffered due to the lack of effective and efficient financial management. Studies on financial risk detection is important for companies to detect possible risks as soon as possible and find out corresponding measures, which is also of great significance for capital market and economic development. This study proposes a financial risk warning model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a classical artificial intelligent model. We first conduct a Principal Component Analysis method to realize the financial data pre-processing to tackle the data noise issue. Then a lightweight CNN network is constructed to detect the hidden financial risks of companies. Finally, the proposed model outperforms other machine learning models according to experiment results.",
