  "title": "Predictors of 30-day readmission following hysterectomy for benign and malignant indications at a tertiary care academic medical center",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hospital readmissions are costly, frequent, and increasingly under public scrutiny. With increased financial constraints on the medical environment, understanding the drivers of unscheduled readmissions following gynecologic surgery will become increasingly important to value-driven care. OBJECTIVE: The current study was conducted to identify risk factors for 30-day readmission following hysterectomy for benign and malignant indications. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2008 through 2010 of all nongravid hysterectomies at a single tertiary care academic medical center. Clinical, perioperative, and physician characteristics were collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of 30-day readmission, stratified by malignant and benign indications for hysterectomy. RESULTS: Among 1649 women who underwent a hysterectomy (1009 for benign indications and 640 for malignancy), 6% were subsequently readmitted within 30 days (8.9% for malignancy vs 4.2% for benign; P < .0001). The mean time to readmission was 13 days (15 days for malignancy vs 10 days for benign; P = .004). The most common reasons for readmission were gastrointestinal (38%) and infectious (34%) etiologies, and 11.6% of readmitted patients experienced a perioperative complication. Among women undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications, a history of a laparotomy, including cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-4.25; P = .03), as well as a perioperative complication (AOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.00-6.04; P = .05) were both associated with a >2-fold increased odds of readmission. Among women undergoing hysterectomy for malignancy, an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification of III or IV (AOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05-3.50; P = .03), a longer length of initial hospitalization (3 days AOR, 7.83; 95% CI, 1.33-45.99; P = .02), and an estimated blood loss >500 mL (AOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.28-8.45; P = .01) were associated with a higher odds of readmission; however, women who underwent a laparoscopic hysterectomy (AOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.86; P = .02) and who were discharged on postoperative day 1 (AOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.82; P = .02) were at a decreased risk of readmission. Physician and operative characteristics were not significant predictors of readmission. CONCLUSION: This study found that malignancy, perioperative complications, and prior open abdominal surgery, including cesarean delivery, are significant risk factors for consequent 30-day readmission following index hysterectomy. It may be possible to identify patients at highest risk for readmission at the time of hysterectomy, which can assist in developing interventions to reduce such events.",
