  "title": "Financial performance of intelligent manufacturing enterprises based on fuzzy neural network and data twinning",
  "abstract": "As we enter the 21st century, with the rapid development of information technology and advanced manufacturing technology and the rapid development of intelligent manufacturing in China, the national investment in intelligent manufacturing research has increased greatly. And in this field to establish research projects; our intelligent manufacturing has been in-depth development of the moment. Assessing the financial performance of a company is to assess the profitability, sustainability and growth ability of a listed company and plays an important role in reducing investment risk, safety and security. This document assesses the financial performance of intelligent manufacturing enterprises by studying and analyzing the improvement of financial management model in intelligent manufacturing model and the optimization of cost involved. Based on fuzzy neural network and data generation technology, this helps to improve the competitive advantage of enterprises and achieve sustainable development and change.",
