  "title": "Patterns and Portfolios based on Stock Multiplex Networks",
  "abstract": "Stock market is an essential part of financial system and also a typical complex system. For complex systems with different attributes, multiplex networks can help to grasp their characteristics from different dimensions. In this paper, Chinese A-share stock market is investigated based on multiplex network using price data and industry classification information. According to the pattern analysis, industry classification information is fused into the community discovery process of multiplex network. Moreover, Two portfolio strategies naming diversified strategy and stabilized strategy are proposed, both of which are derived from multiplex network community structures. The diversified strategy is concentrated on risk diversification among stock market network, while the stabilized strategy is originated from evolution process of community structures. The back test indicates the return of both diversified strategy and stabilized strategy are much higher than that of market index and degree centrality strategy.",
