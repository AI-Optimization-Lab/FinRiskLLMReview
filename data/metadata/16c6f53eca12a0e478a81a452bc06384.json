  "title": "Using Supervised Learning to Estimate Inequality in the Size and Persistence of Income Shocks",
  "abstract": "Household responses to income shocks are important drivers of financial fragility, the evolution of wealth inequality, and the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Traditional approaches to measuring the size and persistence of income shocks are based on restrictive econometric models that impose strong homogeneity across households and over time. In this paper, we propose a more flexible, machine learning framework for estimating income shocks that allows for variation across all observable features and time horizons. First, we propose non-parametric estimands for shocks and shock persistence. We then show how to estimate these quantities by using off-the-shelf supervised learning tools to approximate the conditional expectation of future income given present information. We solve this income prediction problem in a large Icelandic administrative dataset, and then use the estimated shocks to document several features of labor income risk in Iceland that are not captured by standard economic income models.",
