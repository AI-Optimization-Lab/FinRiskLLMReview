  "title": "Prevalence and characterization of food insecurity in a Canadian paediatric emergency department",
  "abstract": "Objectives Food insecurity (FI) is associated with a number of adverse child health outcomes and increased emergency department (ED) use. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the financial hardship faced by many families. We sought to determine the prevalence of FI among children with ED visits, compare this to pre-pandemic rates, and describe associated risk factors. Methods From September to December 2021, families presenting to a Canadian paediatric ED were asked to complete a survey screening for FI along with health and demographic information. Results were compared to data collected in 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations with FI. Results In 2021, 26% (n = 173/665) of families identified as food insecure compared to 22.7% in 2012 (n = 146/644) a difference of 3.3% (95% CI [-1.4%, 8.1%]). In multivariable analysis, greater number of children in the home (OR 1.19, 95% CI [1.01, 1.41]), financial strain from medical expenses (OR 5.31, 95% CI [3.45, 8.18]), and a lack of primary care access (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.08, 1.51]) were independent predictors of FI. Less than half of families with FI reported use of food charity, most commonly food banks, while one-quarter received help from family or friends. Families experiencing FI expressed a preference for support through free or low-cost meals and financial assistance with medical expenses. Conclusion More than one in four families attending a paediatric ED screened positive for FI. Future research is needed to examine the effect of support interventions for families assessed in medical care facilities including financial support for those with chronic medical conditions.",
