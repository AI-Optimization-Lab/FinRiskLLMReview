  "title": "Empirical Studies on Sensitivity of the CSI 300 Index to Market Movements",
  "abstract": "In this paper we apply the principal components analysis to construct a market portfolio based on the daily returns of the Shanghai Composite Index, the Shenzhen Component Index, the Growth Enterprise Index and the Middle and Small Capital Stocks Index during the period February 25, 2015 to. June 12, 2015. Then we make empirical studies on sensitivity of the CSI 300 Index to the market portfolio by principal components regression, the conclusion is that the CSI 300 Index could not reflect the market movements.",
