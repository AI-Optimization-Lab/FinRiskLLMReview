  "title": "A novel Monte Carlo approach to hybrid local volatility models",
  "abstract": "We present in a Monte Carlo simulation framework, a novel approach for the evaluation of hybrid local volatility [Risk, 1994, 7, 18-20], [Int. J. Theor. Appl. Finance, 1998, 1, 61-110] models. In particular, we consider the stochastic local volatility modelsee e.g. Lipton et al. [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14, 1899-1922], Piterbarg [Risk, 2007, April, 84-89], Tataru and Fisher [Quantitative Development Group, Bloomberg Version 1, 2010], Lipton [Risk, 2002, 15, 61-66]and the local volatility model incorporating stochastic interest ratessee e.g. Atlan [ArXiV preprint math/0604316, 2006], Piterbarg [Risk, 2006, 19, 66-71], Deelstra and Rayee [Appl. Math. Finance, 2012, 1-23], Ren et al. [Risk, 2007, 20, 138-143]. For both model classes a particular (conditional) expectation needs to be evaluated which cannot be extracted from the market and is expensive to compute. We establish accurate and cheap to evaluate' approximations for the expectations by means of the stochastic collocation method [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2007, 45, 1005-1034], [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2005, 27, 1118-1139], [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2012, 22, 1-33], [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2008, 46, 2309-2345], [J. Biomech. Eng., 2011, 133, 031001], which was recently applied in the financial context [Available at SSRN 2529691, 2014], [J. Comput. Finance, 2016, 20, 1-19], combined with standard regression techniques. Monte Carlo pricing experiments confirm that our method is highly accurate and fast.",
