  "title": "Matrix Assessment Method for Financial Risks",
  "abstract": "In the present-day business environment, the impact of financial risks on the efficiency and performance of the organization's financial security system as well as on its financial security level becomes increasingly important. The issues related to the approaches and methods of financial risk assessment, designed to prevent the negative consequences were addressed in the works of Russian and foreign scientists. However, certain schemes, algorithms, methods, models and, approaches to the analysis and assessment of financial risks still remain to be poorly developed. In this view, there is emerging need for the development of a mechanism which would allow assessing the existing financial risks based on the available information sources. The above-mentioned factors render the topic of the current work highly relevant. In the present work we define in detail the concept of financial risks and provide the classification of financial risks. The approaches and methods currently used to assess financial risks are analyzed. We report further the development of the integrated matrix assessment method to estimate the risks of financial equilibrium disturbance. We highlight the potential advantages and drawbacks of this method, describe the key steps in the development and implementation of the discussed matrix method, and justify the choice of the indicator system on which the method is based. The practical relevance of the work is determined by the versatility of the proposed matrix diagnostic analysis method which may be used both in financial risk management to forecast financial insolvency and assess the risk of bankruptcy and in audit to provide support for the continuity assumption when carrying out the analytical review procedures. The results of the work were applied to 15 vine producers in the Krasnodar Krai. A more close analysis is provided for Lefkadia LLC.",
