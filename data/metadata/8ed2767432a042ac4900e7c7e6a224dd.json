  "title": "The risks of rural development in Ukraine",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study is identification and classification of the risks of rural development in Ukraine, characteristic of their specific features. To achieve the objectives of the study, the conception of rurality is formulated as a process of rural social development that takes place in rural areas. Ukraine is considered as an agrarian country, which has a huge agricultural potential. We characterize the risks of rural development in Ukraine: cognitive; psychological (mental); specific (spatial and sectoral); organizational and structural; institutional (political and administrative) economic and financial; environmental; social. Analysed model of rural development in Ukraine, the strategy 3+5 - Strategy of prosperous country and the policy of decentralization of state power. Basing on a comprehensive analysis of the risks of rural development in Ukraine it is concluded that they pose a real threat not only for food security, but also the national security of Ukraine. The main objectives of the strategy are: rural development and risk management of rural development in Ukraine.",
