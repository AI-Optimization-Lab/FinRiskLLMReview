  "title": "Smoking, Stress, and Health Risk Behaviors During the Early Phase of COVID-19 Lockdowns Among Residents of Flint, Michigan",
  "abstract": "Food insecurity and smoking commonly co-occur in underserved populations, exacerbating health disparities. This study assesses smoking and its associations with mental health and health risk behaviors among residents of Flint, Michigan in the early phase of COVID lockdowns. The survey captured smoking status, mental health indicators, and health risk behaviors among 106 who had financial needs and limited mobility and received community nutritional services. Comparisons by demographics showed that those who lived alone, used marijuana, and had frequent alcohol drinking tended to smoke more than their counterparts. Results from logistic regression showed that those with high levels of stress, marijuana use, and alcohol consumption were more likely to smoke. Living alone was associated with smoking and health risk behaviors. This research suggests the need for smoking prevention and community health practices addressing stress, health risk behaviors, and circumstances that might drive the association with living alone such as loneliness.",
