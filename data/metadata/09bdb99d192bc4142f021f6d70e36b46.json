  "title": "Treatment of Vancouver type B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures",
  "abstract": "Purpose Stem loosening in both cemented and uncemented total hip arthroplasty is the hallmark of the Vancouver type B2 classification of periprosthetic hip fractures. Methods We discuss the technique we use at our institution for treating these fractures. Results Periprosthetic femoral-shaft fractures are associated with a relatively high mortality rate, approximating that of patients with hip fractures. Outcomes are directly associated with early mobilisation and construct stability. Conclusions We recommend performing the procedure only when the surgeon is proficient in revision hip surgery and trauma care. A well-selected portfolio of different stem designs and an array of osteosynthesis devices should be available, as well.",
