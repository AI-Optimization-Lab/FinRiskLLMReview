  "title": "AN ALTERNATIVE FOR DETECTING SYSTEMIC RISK IN THE BANKING SECTOR. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS APPROACH",
  "abstract": "Since last global financial crisis academics and regulators alike have drawn increased attention to evaluating and limiting the systemic risk within financial industry. While regulators have full access to confidential information on all supervised entities and market data are available to all interested parties, determining systemic risk where bank shares or debt securities are not publicly listed is problematic to say the least. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate principal components analysis (PCA) as an alternative method for identifying level of systemic risk among banks in small, open economies with un-developed capital market for banks. The study presented in this paper uses publicly available yearly bank performance data (return on assets, equity multiplier, non-performing loans ratio, liquidity and capital adequacy) in Latvia to compute principal components. The increased cross-correlation and interdependency of bank performance indicators, materialized as increased percentage of variance that first two principal components explain, during global financial crisis and ensued European debt crisis show that PCA is an alternative method for tracking level of systemic risk in small, open economies with undeveloped share market for banks. The increased interdependency leads to potential system instability to marginal threads. The results of the research show that PCA is a suitable method for tracking the level of systemic risk in the banking sector even with divergent business strategies and regulatory framework.",
