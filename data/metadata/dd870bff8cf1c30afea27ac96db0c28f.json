  "title": "Catastrophic risks, vulnerability and land use",
  "abstract": "Planning for economic development and social welfare without considering possible catastrophic risks may lead to dangerous clustering of people, production facilities, and infrastructure in hazard-prone areas and critically increase the vulnerability of a region. In this paper we show that land use planning, design and evaluation of structural mitigation measures and financial loss spreading strategies in the presence of catastrophic risks can be viewed as a dynamic stochastic optimization problem. In this model, investments into risk management are considered to enhance sustainable growth of a region and to increase its resilience against catastrophes.",
