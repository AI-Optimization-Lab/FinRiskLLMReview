  "abstract": "The scheme of simultaneously testing many profitable strategies may conceal the hazard of data-snooping bias. However, certain portfolio returns are also more likely to exhibit code-pendency because of their same investment styles. Aiming at the phenomena of stock return anomalies, we consider two multiple testing approaches: one ignores the classification of portfolios and the other utilizes such information. The results based on grouped multiple testing suggest that the implied adjusted critical values for t-statistics may vary across investment styles, and several statistically significant portfolios may be unidentified under the pooled setup.
