  "title": "Investors' mood and herd investing: A quantile-on-quantile regression explanation from crypto market",
  "abstract": "This study uses daily data of 382 cryptocurrencies and a quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) framework developed by Sim and Zhou (2015), to establish a link between herding behavior and investors' mood and provide support for mood-as-information hypothesis in the crypto market. The results of QQR analysis reveal that the effect of investors' mood on herd investing behavior is asymmetric and regime specific with a (weaker)higher (anti)herding tendency towards sad (happy) quantiles of investors' mood. The results provide support to the portfolio managers by documenting that investors' mood can be used as a signal to monitor the possible speculative activities in crypto market.",
