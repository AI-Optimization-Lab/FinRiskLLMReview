  "title": "Prediction of Sequential Values for Debt Recovery",
  "abstract": "The concept of new approach for debt portfolio pattern recognition is presented in the paper. Aggregated prediction of sequential repayment values over time for a set of claims is performed by means of hybrid combination of various machine learning techniques, including clustering of references, model selection and enrichment of input variables with prediction outputs from preceding periods. Experimental studies on real data revealed usefulness of the proposed approach for claim appraisals. The average accuracy was over 93%, much higher than for simplifier methods.",
