  "title": "A self-adapting regression SVM model and its application on middle managers performance evaluation",
  "abstract": "It is very important that middle managers work performance affect the survival and development of enterprises, carry on reasonable, scientific and effective performance evaluation, and encourage them to give full play to the initiative and creativity, which is the reliable protection of achieving the enterprises short-term and long-term objectives. Based on the SVM algorithm theory, this paper establish the middle managers performance evaluation model based on self-adapting regression SVM, through establishing middle managers performance index system, use several SVM classifier series portfolio, solve the problems that the training samples' category and quantity are imbalance, and the data is interfered, realize the performance evaluation to middle managers. Experimental results show that the method improved the middle managers performance evaluation accuracy and efficiency.",
