  "title": "Empirical study on methods of evaluating bank credit risk",
  "abstract": "This paper analysis the financial ratios of companies with multi-statistics, Selects seven finance ratios to set up four-level discrimination functions, and filters five finance ratios to build a logistic regression functions to measure credit risk of enterprises. According to the results of being tested with review and cross-validation, the both models are valuable. The research will be helpful to improving efficiency of credit risk evaluation, to reducing credit risk exposure of bank, to decreasing the ill-asset ratios of bank, to enhancing the quality of credit assets, and to speeding up the development of state-owned commercial banks.",
