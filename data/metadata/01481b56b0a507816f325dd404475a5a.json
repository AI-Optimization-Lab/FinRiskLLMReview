  "title": "Reasons for Migration and Their Associations with HIV Risk and Prevention Among Cisgender Sexual Minority Men: A Latent Class Analysis",
  "abstract": "The immigrant population in the United States (U.S.) is rapidly growing; yet there is limited knowledge about how reasons for migrating to the U.S. are associated with HIV prevention behaviors. Using data from the American Men's Internet Survey (2018-2020), we performed a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify patterns in reasons for migration among cisgender gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority men (SMM) who born outside the U.S. We used multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographic characteristics to assess class associations with the following in the past 12 months: condomless anal sex (CAS), illicit drug use, marijuana use, HIV testing, and PrEP use. LCA identified six distinct patterns in reasons for migration among the sample (n = 1,657): (1) Family and friends (14%); (2) Financial (17%); (3) Personal freedom related to being gay (10%); (4) Pursuit of opportunities while living openly as SMM (12%); (5) Educational purposes (18%); (6) Not my decision (29%). While HIV testing (range = 57.6-65.4%) and PrEP use (range = 15.6-21.4%) did not vary by class (p > .05 for all), CAS and illicit drug use were significantly different (p < .05). SMM who migrated to pursue opportunities while living openly and whose reasons were not their decision had greater odds of CAS than SMM who migrated for educational purposes (aOR:1.72, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]:1.15-2.59; 1.57, 1.13-2.19, respectively). Reasons for migration among SMM were associated with behaviors that can increase HIV risk, but not testing or PrEP. Push and pull factors related to migration should be considered when developing behavioral HIV interventions for immigrant SMM.",
