  "title": "Divide et impera? A financial assessment of the (de)concentration in the Brazilian reinsurance market",
  "abstract": "This study aims to shed light on the relatively obscure landscape of industrial organization within the reinsurance sector, particularly in Brazil, which was among the last nations to dismantle state monopoly. Our objective is to assess the impact of concentration in the Brazilian reinsurance market on reinsurer performance. Employing traditional indexes from Industrial Organization literature and utilizing regression models for panel data, we examine the elasticity of revenues from reinsurers as a reflection of the sector's competitive structure. The data set comprises 78,190 observations from 164 reinsurers across 22 lines of business (LOB) monthly spanning from 2008 to 2022. The findings reveal a pronounced market concentration, with higher industry concentration correlating with diminished premium revenues across most LOBs. Additionally, Local reinsurers enjoy substantial advantages over Admitted and Occasional counterparts. Notably, factors such as portfolio diversification and economic group affiliation prove significant, particularly concerning the category of reinsurer.",
