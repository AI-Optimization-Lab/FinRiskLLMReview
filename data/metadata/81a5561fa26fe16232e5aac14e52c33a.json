  "title": "The Empirical Study of Chinese Mutual Funds' Evaluation System Building",
  "abstract": "This paper built a Chinese mutual funds' evaluation system through three parts, including the investment return factors, risk factors and the mutual fund managers' investment management capabilities, of 10 multi-indictors to associated with our financial circumstance. And then we used principal components analysis to extract principle factors from these 10 multi-factors to construct a system in order to ranking 50 sample funds comprehensively. Compared with the third rating agencies' rating system, this system is more understandable and useful, especially suit for the ordinary investors.",
