  "title": "Hybrid Intelligent Patent Mapping for Offshore Wind Industry Analysis",
  "abstract": "Offshore wind technology is the most popular in recent years, the field of energy technology issues, was becoming increasingly relevant research. However, the research is still lack in the patent portfolio. This study examines numerous patent and use Intelligent clustering method try to identify appropriate patents by examining all-world patent pool cases of offshore wind power development, a form of alternative energy, and analyzing technology and patent maps. Thus, we identified a promising research direction, thereby enabling industry personnel to make technological breakthroughs in this field.",
