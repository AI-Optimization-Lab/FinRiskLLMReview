  "title": "Heterogeneity of financial toxicity and associated risk factors for older cancer survivors in China",
  "abstract": "In China, older cancer survivors may show heterogeneity in financial toxicity (FT). We aimed to identify FT profiles among older Chinese cancer survivors and examine the association between FT profiles and individual characteristics. We used a latent profile analysis to categorize participants and a multinomial logistic regression to examine the associations. We identified three distinct FT profiles: high, moderate, and low. Participants aged 65-69 years, with a monthly household income >= 5,000 CNY and a high school education or above were more likely to be classified into the moderate than high FT profile, a monthly household income >= 5,000 CNY increased the likelihood of being in the low FT profile and living alone negatively affected the odds of being in the low FT profile. The findings identified heterogeneity in FT among this population, may help identify high-risk groups, and may enable early intervention.",
