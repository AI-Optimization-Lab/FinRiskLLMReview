  "title": "Enterprise Financial Influencing Factors and Early Warning Based on Decision Tree Model",
  "abstract": "The development of a financial analysis system is essential for modern businesses to improve their management systems. In light of the global financial crisis, it is even more critical for businesses to develop a rigorous financial analysis system to avoid risks. DM does not necessitate the development of a complex mathematical theory; as long as data are filtered, hidden features between data can be found. The decision tree algorithm is one of several DM methods. With the rapid advancement of DM technology, theories and applications related to it are maturing at a rapid pace. This study will develop a decision tree-based enterprise financial risk analysis and early warning model, analyze enterprise financial influencing factors, apply the decision tree method to enterprise financial risk analysis and early warning, and provide a reference for enterprise financial risk early warning and risk control decision-making.",
