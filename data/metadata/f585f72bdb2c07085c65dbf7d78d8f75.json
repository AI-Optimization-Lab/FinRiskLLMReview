  "title": "Implied Volatility Surface Estimation Using Transductive Gaussian Fields Regression",
  "abstract": "Implied volatility estimation is one of the fundamental tasks for asset pricing and risk management. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of semi-supervised regression techniques to estimate an implied volatility surface from the real market option data. Specifically, we employ a transductive Gaussian field regression method since it is able to predict a distribution of the implied volatilities for unlabelled data using only partially labeled data. We've conducted simulation on S&P 500 index data before and after the global financial crisis with discussions of the observed empirical properties of the method.",
