  "abstract": "BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC has an upstream gas business with large process and export capacity, significant market growth opportunities, and a large portfolio of development and exploration opportunities. With such an asset, there must be a process to facilitate and guide capital-spending decisions that underpin a strategy for delivering a gas growth agenda. The process must accurately identify preinvestment opportunities that can be leveraged toward future growth.",
