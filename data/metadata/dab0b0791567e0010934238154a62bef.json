  "title": "DEEPCLAIR: Utilizing Market Forecasts for Effective Portfolio Selection",
  "abstract": "Utilizing market forecasts is pivotal in optimizing portfolio selection strategies. We introduce DEEPCLAIR, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DEEPCLAIR leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.",
