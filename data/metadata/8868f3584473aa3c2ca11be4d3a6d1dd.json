  "title": "A study of the relationship between environment protection and increase of foreign exchange reserves",
  "abstract": "Tremendous FER not only heightened China's credit level and payment capability, but also is a reflection of unbalanced economic development. Frequent trade frictions are accompanied by European sovereignty debt crisis & serious US government financial deficit, which increased the risk of China' FER. Domestic environment worsened. Longtime incentive for export & FDI attraction at any cost generated domestic inflation, sacrificed our natural resources and the rights & benefits of the working class, and polluted the natural environment. Based on econometrics software and data from year 1991 to 2011, this paper studies the relationship between environmental protection and China's FER, regression of which reveals an overly high trade dependence. Both trade surplus and CPI are significantly and positively related with the rapid growth of China' FER. Nevertheless, PER contributed little to the increase of average township disposable income. Furthermore, the generating mechanism as well as the drawbacks of the rapid growth of China' PER are analyzed.",
