  "title": "Enterprise Financial Risk Early Warning System Based on Structural Equation Model",
  "abstract": "This article uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze and study the factors affecting corporate financial risks. At the same time, the regression analysis model is used for risk warning. The empirical test effectively proves that the formation of corporate financial risk is closely related to the industry environment in which it is located. After estimating the model's parameters, it is found that monetary policy, enterprise-scale, market supply and marketing, and macroeconomic factors are the main factors that affect the financial risks of enterprises.",
