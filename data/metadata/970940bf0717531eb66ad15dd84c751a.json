  "title": "Modelling European Socio-economic- political Issues: The Spanish Mortgage Market",
  "abstract": "Spanish homeownership rate is higher than in most western countries. This fact linked to an excessive indebtedness of the Spanish population previous to the financial crash explains the increasing risk of the Spanish banking system. For the particular case of Spain, the level of unemployment rose to 25%. Obviously, there is a positive correlation between the mortgage default and the unemployment rates. In this paper, we propose a behavioural-economic population model to estimate the default and foreclosure rates of the Spanish mortgages market in the next years. As a result, the expected Spanish default and foreclosure rates are forecasted by an appropriate classification of the mortgages, taking into account several economic and social indicators.",
