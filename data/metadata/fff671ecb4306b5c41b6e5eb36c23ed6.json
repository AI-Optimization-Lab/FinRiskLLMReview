  "title": "Mixup Gamblers: Learning to Abstain with Auto-Calibrated Reward for Mixed Samples",
  "abstract": "Deep learning models have recently been used in a wide range of fields. However, one of the problems with deep learning is the reliability of the inference results. Models that can evaluate the reliability of their inference results are important, and therefore methods such as selective classification have been proposed. Selective classification is classification with a reject option, which reduces false inferences by allowing an inference to be rejected. Inspired by portfolio theory, L. Ziyin et al. proposed a deep gamblers method that learns to reject. Taking this approach a step further, we propose a learning method for selective classification, mixup gamblers, to improve rejection ability. This method exploits data augmentation parameters for rejection learning. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a selective classification benchmark.",
