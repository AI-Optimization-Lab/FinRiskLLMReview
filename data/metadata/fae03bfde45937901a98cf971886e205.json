  "title": "Budget impact analysis of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio as prediction test in Italian women with suspected preeclampsia",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disease which represents a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Accurate prediction of PE risk could provide an increase in health benefits and better patient management.Objective: To estimate the economic impact of introducing Elecsys sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test, in addition to standard practice, for the prediction of PE in women with suspected PE in the Italian National Health Service (INHS).Methods: A decision tree model has been developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of pregnant women from the first presentation of clinical suspicion of PE in the second and third trimesters until delivery. The model provides an estimation of the financial impact of introducing sFlt-1/PlGF versus standard practice. Clinical inputs have been derived from PROGNOSIS study and from literature review, and validated by National Clinical Experts. Resources and unit costs have been obtained from Italian-specific sources.Results: Healthcare costs associated with the management of a pregnant woman with clinical suspicion of PE equal Euro2384 when following standard practice versus Euro1714 using sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test.Conclusions: Introduction of sFlt-1/PlGF into hospital practice is cost-saving. Savings are generated primarily through improvement in diagnostic accuracy and reduction in unnecessary hospitalization for women before PE's onset.",
