  "title": "Weapons system portfolio selection based on the contribution rate evaluation of system of systems",
  "abstract": "The weapons system portfolio selection problem arises at the equipment demonstration stage and deals with the military application requirements. Further, the contribution rate of the system is one of the important indicators to evaluate the role of a system, which can facilitate the weapons system portfolio selection. Therefore, combining the system contribution rate with system portfolio selection is the focus of this study. It also focuses on calculating the contribution rates of multiple equipment systems with various types of capabilities. The contribution rate is measured by establishing a hierarchical multi-criteria value model from three dimensions. Based on the value model, the feasible portfolios are developed under certain cost constraints and the optimal weapons system portfolios are obtained by using the classification optimization selection strategy. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.",
