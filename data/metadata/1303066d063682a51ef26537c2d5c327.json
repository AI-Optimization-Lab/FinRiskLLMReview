  "title": "The Role of Social Media in International Tourist's Decision Making",
  "abstract": "Recent crises have highlighted the increasingly important role of social media in crisis communications. Attention has been given to residents' use of social media during a crisis; however, there is a lack of research which focuses on factors that influence tourists' use of social media during a crisis. Understanding these factors can have practical implications for destinations in crisis. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether internal, travel-related, and demographic factors affect the likelihood to use social media to seek information if a crisis were to occur while traveling. Linear regression revealed that the countries of origin of India, Brazil, Australia, and South Korea; the age group 31-40; past international travel experience; and perceptions of crime, natural disasters, disease, financial, equipment failure, weather, cultural barriers, and political risk were positively associated with the likelihood of using social media in the event of a crisis during travel.",
