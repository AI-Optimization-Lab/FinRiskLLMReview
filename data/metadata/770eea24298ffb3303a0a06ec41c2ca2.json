  "title": "Islamic Bank's Fee Income and Risk: Evidence from Malaysia",
  "abstract": "Fee income, a component of other operating income in Islamic Banks, has become increasingly important in raising the banks' earnings to counter declining net incomes due to competition from other financial competitors. However, it is vital for Islamic banks to determine any potential event or extensive risk that will affect their performance due to this activity, since the results of previous studies showed mixed results especially in the Western context such as those in the US, Germany and other European countries. Using Malaysian Islamic bank's data between 2008 and 2013, this study employs the panel data regression analysis to examine relationship between Islamic bank's fee income and risk. The findings imply that banks which are associated with fee income generating activities exhibit less risk.",
