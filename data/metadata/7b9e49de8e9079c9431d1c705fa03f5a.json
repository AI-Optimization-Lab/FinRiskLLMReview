  "title": "Suicidal ideation during the transitioning from prison to the community: financial hardship, relational distress, health issues, and gender",
  "abstract": "Individuals who had contact with the criminal justice system are at high risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. The links between suicide risk and adverse experiences during the transition from prison to community are not well understood. This study sought to fill that gap by examining adverse reentry experiences as determinants of suicidal ideation among post-incarcerated men and women. Longitudinal data documenting reentry experiences during the first four to eight months after release were analyzed in binary cross tabulations and multivariate regression models. Results indicated that multiple reentry barriers in financial, relational and health domains exerted positive effects on suicidal ideation. Further, gender intersected with reentry barriers to predict suicidal ideation. Post-incarcerated women were more sensitive to relational reentry barriers, whereas health-related barriers exerted an amplified effect on suicidal ideation for their male counterparts. Policy implications and directions for future research are provided.",
