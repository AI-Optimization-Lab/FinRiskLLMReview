  "title": "Portfolio recommendations to improve risk of default in microfinance",
  "abstract": "This article presents an exciting application of machine learning for loan origination in microfinance. Microfinance targets people who cannot build a credit history and therefore cannot access loans from banks or other financial institutions. We use data from a Mexican microfinance company that operates in several regions throughout the country. The objective is to guide intermediate lenders to choose their clients and achieve a lowerr credit default risk. We use several statistical models such as principal component analysis, clustering analysis and a regression tree. We obtain, as a result, a series of recommendations based on the characteristics of the clients.",
