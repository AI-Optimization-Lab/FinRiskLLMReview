  "title": "An Empirical Study on Critical Success Factors Based on Governance for IT Projects in China",
  "abstract": "Although there are lots of studies on project Critical Success Factors (CSFs), they do not classify different factors so that the value of these studies may be affected. Nowadays more and more project issues are from the outside of project team, of course they can not be solved by project manager and project management, furthermore, research on Program Management, Portfolio Management and Enterprise Project Management (EPM) could not obviously avoid this predicament. In this paper, we summarize the previous studies on project CSFs and point out that project success depends on the success in technology, management and governance, which can help project managers to find the causes of project issues and take the apt action. Then we aim to make empirical research on IT projects in China as this kind of projects exist widely and also have higher risk and more creativity. According to empirical results by Spot Check, Descriptive Statistics, Factor Analysis and Clustering, we finally abstract the CSFs based on governance for IT projects in China.",
