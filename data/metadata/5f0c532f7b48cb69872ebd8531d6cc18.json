  "title": "Risk Perception and Consumer Behavior towards Online Purchases in the Klang Valley",
  "abstract": "The increase in online purchases was one of the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Although it simplifies our daily life, many still think that buying online is a risky activity. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the relationship between risk perceptions and consumer behavior towards online purchases in the Klang Valley. A total of 392 respondents answered an online questionnaire, but only 373 questionnaires were completed and could be used. Data from the questionnaire were analyzed using the multiple regression analysis method. The results of the analysis found that financial risk perception has a significant and negative relationship with consumer behavior towards online purchases in the Klang Valley, while product risk and delivery risk perception have a positive relationship. The results of the study provide input for e-commerce and online sellers to enhance their services. It also helps identify risks that may harm their business and to take action to mitigate the likelihood and impact should the identified risks occur.",
