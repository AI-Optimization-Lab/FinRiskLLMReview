  "title": "Technology-Driven Strategy for Combating Corruption in Egypt's Construction Industry",
  "abstract": "Corruption remains a significant challenge in the Egyptian construction industry, causing financial losses, project delays, and undermining worker wellbeing. This paper outlines a human-cantered technology strategy for combating corruption while promoting sustainability within the industry. Through a mixed-methods approach, including a literature review, expert interviews, and a risk-benefit analysis, the study identifies Building Information Modelling (BIM) and e-bidding systems as immediate, high-benefit, and low-risk solutions. Conversely, blockchain, machine learning, and other technologies, while offering high potential benefits, also entail elevated risks, requiring careful risk management. The devised strategy prioritizes technologies that enhance transparency, protect worker rights, and promote ethical practices, offering a roadmap for industry executives to combat corruption while building a sustainable future in construction.",
