This study was used moderating regression analyze. The data used in this research is financial annual report in manufacturing companies through Indonesian Capital Market Directory. This paper has informed that the political costs, risk of litigation does not affect the quality of accounting information. However, the protection of investors and the debt to equity has a significant influence to the quality accounting information. The results also informed that the audit committee has moderate the relationship between debt to equity, the risk of litigation and investor protection and real earning management, but the audit committee did not moderate the relationship between the political cost and the real earnings management.
