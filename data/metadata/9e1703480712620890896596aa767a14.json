  "title": "Liquidity risk and expected cryptocurrency returns",
  "abstract": "This paper examines how liquidity risk is priced in the cross-section of cryptocurrency returns. In doing so, we use the Amihud measure as a liquidity proxy. By employing the univariate portfolio analysis, the bivariate portfolio analysis, and the Fama-MacBeth regression analysis, we document a negative relationship between liquidity and cryptocurrency returns. Additional tests demonstrate that this finding is robust to alternative liquidity measurement as well as size screens and show no evidence of a significant intertemporal relationship between liquidity and expected returns for three leading cryptocurrencies. Our conclusions add to the understanding of how markets price cryptocurrencies.",
