  "title": "A Review of Stock Market Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)",
  "abstract": "Stock market is a promising financial investment that can generate great wealth. However, the volatile nature of the stock market makes it a very high risk investment. Thus, a lot of researchers have contributed their efforts to forecast the stock market pricing and average movement. Researchers have used various methods in computer science and economics in their quests to gain a piece of this volatile information and make great fortune out of the stock market investment. This paper investigates various techniques for the stock market prediction using artificial neural network ( ANN). The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the applications of ANN in stock market prediction in order to determine what can be done in the future.",
