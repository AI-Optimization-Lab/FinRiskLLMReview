  "title": "Implications of sustainability reporting and institutional investors' ownership for external audit work: evidence from Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "PurposeThis study aims to assess whether non-financial corporate social responsibility (CSR) information decreases audit risk and audit scope and enables speedier completion of audit reports. The study also investigates whether institutional investors' ownership (IIO) has an influence on the association between CSR disclosures and audit report lag (ARL). Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a sample of 154 Saudi firms over 2016-2021 (837 observations) and applies ordinary least square regression to examine the study hypotheses. FindingsThis study's results show that ARL is significantly shorter for firms with higher CSR disclosures. Furthermore, the findings show that IIO has no significant impact on the association between CSR disclosures and ARL. Originality/valueThis study offers new insights into how auditors respond to CSR disclosures and whether institutional investor monitoring influences the audit process in an emerging economy.",
