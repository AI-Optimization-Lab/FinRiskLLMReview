  "title": "Association of surgeon's sex, and surgeon-patient dyad with financial outcomes among patients undergoing cancer surgery",
  "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Surgeon sex has been associated with perioperative clinical outcomes among patients undergoing oncologic surgery. There may be variations in financial outcomes relative to the surgeon-patient dyad. We sought to define the association of surgeon's sex with perioperative financial outcomes following cancer surgery. Methods: Patients who underwent resection of lung, breast, hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB), or colorectal cancer between 2014 and 2021 were identified from the Medicare Standard Analytic Files. A generalized linear model with gamma regression was utilized to characterize the association between sex concordance and expenditures. Results: Among 207,935 Medicare beneficiaries (breast: n = 14,753, 7.1%, lung: n = 59,644, 28.7%, HPB: n = 23,400, 11.3%, colorectal: n = 110,118, 53.0%), 87.8% (n = 182,643) and 12.2% (n = 25,292) of patients were treated by male and female surgeons, respectively. On multivariable analysis, female surgeon sex was associated with slightly reduced index expenditures (mean difference -$353, 95%CI -$580, -$126; p = 0.003). However, there were no differences in 90-day post-discharge inpatient (mean difference -$-225, 95%CI -$570, -$121; p = 0.205) and total expenditures (mean difference $133, 95%CI -$279, $545; p = 0.525). Conclusions: There was minor risk-adjusted variation in perioperative expenditures relative to surgeon sex. To improve perioperative financial outcomes, a diverse surgical workforce with respect to patient and surgeon sex is warranted.",
