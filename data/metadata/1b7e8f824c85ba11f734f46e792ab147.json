  "title": "A Knowledge-Based Approach to Product Concept Screening",
  "abstract": "This paper is concerned with developing a knowledge-based approach for selecting portfolio of product concepts for development. The critical success factors for new product development are identified on the basis of information acquired from an enterprise system, including the fields of sales and marketing, project management, and production. The model of new product screening consists of enterprise functional domains and business information systems. The model has been described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that contains a set of decision variables, their domains, and the constraints. Knowledge base is specified according to CSP framework and it reflects the company's resources and relationships identified. The illustrative example presents the use of fuzzy neural network to estimating the success of new products and constraint programming to product concept screening in the context of the different search strategies.",
