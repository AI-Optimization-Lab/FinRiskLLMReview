  "title": "Sources of Stress among Adults with Co-occurring Drug Use and Depressive Symptoms",
  "abstract": "Stress, drug use, and depression are interconnected, but less is understood about sources of stress among adults with co-occurring drug use and depressive symptoms. The current study aimed to identify sources of stress and correlates among these adults. Data come from a cross-sectional baseline survey, including participants (n=336) 18 to 55years old, who reported past 6-month heroin or cocaine use and depressive symptoms. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify sources of stress. Chi-square and multivariable Poisson regression with robust error variance were used to explore correlates of each factor. Three sources of stress were identified: financial stress related to drugs, stress due to community features, and stress involving a person's network. Past 6-month injection drug use (aPR=1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.67), perceived lack of control over drug use (aPR=1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30), and difficulty abstaining from drug use (aPR=1.55, 95% CI 1.22-1.97) were associated with an increased risk of high drug-related financial stress. Neighborhood disorder (aPR=2.42, 95% CI 1.80-3.24) and sleeping on the street (aPR=1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.80) were associated with an increased risk of high community-level stress. Past 6-month injection drug use (aPR=1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.58), perceived lack of control over drug use (aPR=1.37, 95% CI 1.10-1.70), and drug use stigma was associated with an increased prevalence of high drug network stress (aPR=1.32, 95% CI 1.05-1.65). Stress is a complex construct, including distinct sources and correlates. Further understanding of sources of stress is beneficial in recognizing potentially modifiable challenges faced by individuals who use drugs and experience depressive symptoms.",
