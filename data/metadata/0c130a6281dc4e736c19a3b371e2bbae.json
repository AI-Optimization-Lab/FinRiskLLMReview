  "title": "Random forest tree classification algorithm for predicating loan",
  "abstract": "A loan is the amount of money you receive from a bank or any other financial institution in exchange for a commitment to repay the principal amount with added interest after a specific time period. Profit or a loss of a bank largely depends on the factor of loan repayment of every borrower. Thus, the recovery of every loan granted is a major contributing parameter in the financial statement of every bank. Considering, the exponential increase in the no of people applying for bank loans, a bank must carefully analyze different attributes of every customer before granting its most valuable while limited asset. Our proposed model takes into consideration the loan grant given to people in the previous years by mining them and the mined patterns were used to train our model. Our paper, uses a machine learning model for predicting whether a loan can be approved for an applicant thereby efficiently reducing the risk involved in financial organizations or banks in the form of defaulters.
