  "title": "Which exchange rate system between Central European countries and the Monetary Union countries?",
  "abstract": "Central European Countries will have to choose an exchange rate system vis a vis the European Monetary Union: flexibility or more likely fixity of the nominal or real exchange rate. We first build a theoretical model with overlapping generations and two sectors (traditionnal and advanced) representing a Central European country. We assume that financial integration into Europe will reduce the interest rate risk premium paid by country on its external debt We analyse the effects of this evolution on the optimal use of this inflation in order to stabilise public debt, with or without tax distorsions. We also examine the effects of integration on the of the economy, on relative prices and on the normal parity vis a vis Euro. Those analyses allow us to adress the issue of the sustainability of fixed nominal exchange rates for Central European countries. We also think that the integration in the Monetary Union will lead to a suppression to the subsidies those countries had previously put in place, and we try to assess the effect of this suppression on optimal inflation, then on the possibility to maintain fixed nominal exchange rates.
