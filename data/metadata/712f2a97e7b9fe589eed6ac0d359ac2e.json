  "title": "Portfolio selection via high-dimensional stochastic factor Copula",
  "abstract": "In the financial market, different assets typically exhibit time-varying asymmetric dependence in scenarios of rise and fall. To accommodate this feature, this article proposes a novel model, the Skew t stochastic factor Copula model, designed to accurately capture the skewness characteristic of each variable. We employ an expectation-maximization algorithm for variable clustering and demonstrate its finite sample properties. In addition, we integrate this proposed model into a mean-ES model and explore its feasibility and applicability in financial risk measurement and portfolio optimization, supported by empirical studies.",
