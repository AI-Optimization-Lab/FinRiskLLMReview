  "title": "Service Deployment Strategy for Predictive Analysis of FinTech IoT Applications in Edge Networks",
  "abstract": "The seamless integration of sensors and smart communication technologies has led to the development of various supporting systems for financial technology (FinTech). The emergence of the next-generation Internet of Things (Nx-IoT) for FinTech applications enhances the customer satisfaction ratio. The main research challenge for FinTech applications is to analyze the incoming tasks at the edge of the networks with minimum delay and power consumption while increasing the prediction accuracy. Motivated by the above-mentioned challenge, in this article, we develop a ranked-based service deployment strategy and an artificial intelligence technique for financial data analysis at edge networks. Initially, a risk-based task classification strategy has been developed for classifying the incoming financial tasks and providing the importance to the risk-based task for meeting users' satisfaction ratio. Besides that, an efficient service deployment strategy is developed using $Hall's$ theorem to assign the ranked-based financial data to the suitable edge or cloud servers with minimum delay and power consumption. Finally, the standard support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm is used at edge networks for analyzing the financial data with higher accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and SVM model at edge networks over the baseline algorithms and classification models, respectively.",
