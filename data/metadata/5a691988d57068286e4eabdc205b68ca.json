  "title": "Price determinants of Aboriginal art, and its role as an alternative asset class",
  "abstract": "This paper analyzes auction results for over 4000 paintings by Australian Aboriginal artists to investigate determinants of prices in the Aboriginal art market. This is the first financial study of an indigenous art market, and hedonic, repeat sales and hybrid regression analyses find it shares price determinants with traditional art markets (with price premia attached to artist name, death, painting size, leading auction house, and winter sale). However, Aboriginal art's unique features significantly affect prices, particularly works that use traditional Aboriginal media and those with reputation-affirming traits. An Aboriginal Art Index provides 6.6% annual return (standard deviation 17.9%), which is comparable to traditional asset classes and superior on a risk-adjusted basis. Returns to Aboriginal art are negatively correlated with returns from other assets, and so it adds value to a diversified investment portfolio. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
