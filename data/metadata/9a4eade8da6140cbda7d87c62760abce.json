  "title": "BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CRISIS RESEARCH",
  "abstract": "The global financial crisis that followed Lehman Brothers' declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008 critically highlighted the significance of research on systemic risk and macro-prudential supervision. Accordingly, this paper mainly analyzed the relationship between financial crises and the article output in financial crisis research through the application of bibliometrics. The occurrence of a financial crisis leads to changes in the output of articles on crisis and risks. Hence, we focused on bibliographic coupling (e.g., co-authorship, co-occurrence), data classification by risk type in this study (e.g., market risk, credit risk) and citation analysis (e.g., top 1% cited paper). Meanwhile, the analysis indicated the most relevant disciplines in financial crisis research. For example, the number of top 1% cited articles and citations, MARKET RISK documents and citations published the most papers. In other words, the market risk is valued in the financial risk literature.",
