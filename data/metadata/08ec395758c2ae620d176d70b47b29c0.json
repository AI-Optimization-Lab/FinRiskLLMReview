  "title": "Study on Risk Perception of Domestic Cruise Tourists",
  "abstract": "Although risk perception plays a key role in affecting cruise tourists' purchase intention, the existing literature lacks of an empirical exploration of risk perception dimensions of cruise travel. A study of tourists of WuSongKou International Cruise Terminal in Shanghai was carried out by the methods of in-depth interview and questionnaire survey to explore the specific dimensions of cruise tourists' risk perception. And this paper found six dimensions of risk perception from the perspective of tourists' loss classification: physical risk, psychosocial risk, service risk, performance risk, communication risk and financial risk.",
