  "title": "Empirical Study on the Assessment and Measurement of the Credit Risk of Commercial Banks in China-Based on Multivariate Linear Discrimination Model and Logistic Regression Model",
  "abstract": "Credit risk affects not only directly the operations and security of commercial banks, but also the stability of financial system, as well the healthy development of macro-economy. Credit risk assessment and measurement technology in China now, is rather traditional and single, which has a long way to go compared with developed countries. In this paper, by using the 200 listed companies in our country as sample, linear discrimination model and logistic regression model are established respectively, which properly separate ST companies and non-ST companies. Regarding the ability to predict, especially for data of one or two years ago, logistic regression model demonstrates better prediction results.",
