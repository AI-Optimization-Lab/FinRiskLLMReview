  "title": "Influence Factors Analysis on Selection Trend of Financing Ways-Evidence from Chinese Listed Companies",
  "abstract": "Drawing Chinese listed companies during 2009-2013 as samples, and using the stepwise regression method, the paper analyzes empirically the influence factors of selection trend of financing ways. The results show profitability, information asymmetry, operational risk, financial risk, non- debt tax shields and equity capital cost respectively have different significance sorting and correlation with internal financing degree, debt financing degree and equity financing degree. Among them, financial risk is the primary factor to internal financing trend and debt financing trend, and profitability is the primary factors to equity financing trend.",
