  "title": "Mean-Reverting Statistical Arbitrage Strategies in Crude Oil Markets",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the concept of statistical arbitrage through the definition of a mean-reverting trading strategy that captures persistent anomalies in long-run relationships among assets. We model the statistical arbitrage proceeding in three steps: (1) to identify mispricings in the chosen market, (2) to test mean-reverting statistical arbitrage, and (3) to develop statistical arbitrage trading strategies. We empirically investigate the existence of statistical arbitrage opportunities in crude oil markets. In particular, we focus on long-term pricing relationships between the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures and a so-called statistical portfolio, composed by other two crude oils, Brent and Dubai. Firstly, the cointegration regression is used to track the persistent pricing equilibrium between the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price and the statistical portfolio value, and to identify mispricings between the two. Secondly, we verify that mispricing dynamics revert back to equilibrium with a predictable behaviour, and we exploit this stylized fact by applying the trading rules commonly used in equity markets to the crude oil market. The trading performance is then measured by three specific profit indicators on out-of-sample data.",
