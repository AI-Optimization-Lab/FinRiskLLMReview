  "title": "Quantitative impact of correlation errors on basket options with time-varying correlations",
  "abstract": "This study examines the quantitative impact of correlation errors on basket options with time-varying correlations and the risk measures (conditional) value-at-risk (VaR) in the framework of Basel II. The results show that risk measure misestimation due to correlation errors are the largest and most asymmetric for the at-the-money and out-of-the-money basket option. Delta hedging of the basket option reduces risk but increases size and asymmetry effects substantially. Finally, the square-root-of-time rule for VaR does not adjust adequately to correlation errors and consistently underestimates risk measures, which could lead to the VaR exceedance clustering observed during the recent financial crisis.
