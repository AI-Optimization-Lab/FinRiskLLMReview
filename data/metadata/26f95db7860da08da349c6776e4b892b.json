  "title": "The influence of unmet supportive care needs on anxiety and depression during cancer treatment and beyond: a longitudinal study of survivors of haematological cancers",
  "abstract": "Objectives This paper aims to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between patient-reported unmet needs and anxiety and depression for survivors of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Methods In a longitudinal study design, self-reported data were collected through telephone interviews at two time points approximately 7 (T1) and 15 (T2) months post-diagnosis. The sample was recruited through the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry. At T1 and T2, the study outcomes, anxiety and depression, were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and unmet needs were measured using the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34). Questions related to social/family problems, relationship problems and financial problems were also asked. A three-step multivariable hierarchical logistic regression analysis examined the relative role of T1 anxiety and depression, T1 and T2 unmet needs and other psychosocial factors with T2 anxiety and depression. Results Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were observed between unmet needs and psychological distress. T2 anxiety was associated with T1 anxiety (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.86-11.09), T2 psychological needs (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) and with T1 social problems (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.03-5.05) in multivariate analysis. T2 depression was associated with both T1 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.57) and T2 psychological needs (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.70), T2 physical needs (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.27-2.81) and T1 depression (OR 4.52, 95% CI 1.88-10.86). Conclusions Unmet needs that manifest following diagnosis and treatment may persist into early survivorship and contribute to psychological distress. Addressing these needs during treatment may diminish the risk of current and future anxiety and depression.",
