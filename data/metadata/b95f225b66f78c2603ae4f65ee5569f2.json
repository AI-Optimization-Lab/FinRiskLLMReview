  "title": "Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage and knowledge, perceptions and influencing factors among university students in Guangzhou, China",
  "abstract": "Introduction: HPV vaccines were administered in mainland China from July 2017 at a gradual rate. We aimed to assess the vaccination rate and vaccination influencing factors among college students in mainland China. Methods: From October to December 2018, we conducted face-to-face questionnaires including 5 sections and 22 questions to collect demographic information, HPV infection and transmission knowledge, HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes among college students in Guangzhou, China. HPV vaccine vaccination status and cervical screening behaviors were self-reported. Knowledge and attitudes differences between the vaccinate and non-vaccinate groups were analyzed using univariable logistic regression. Vaccination-related influencing factors were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: 5307 of 5414 valid questionnaires were collected. The self-reported cervical screening rate and HPV vaccine coverage were 11.82% (9.03%-14.61%) and 3.09% (2.62%-3.56%). In total, 55.57% of the participants were hesitant about vaccination. Urban residence (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.4-3.3), high monthly consumption (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.9-3.6), awareness of vaccination adaptive population (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.9-5.0), awareness of infection-related risk factors (OR = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.1-5.7), and awareness of HPV vaccine effectiveness (OR = 3.2, 95%CI: 2.0-5.2) were significant in multivariable logistic regression. Conclusion: HPV vaccine coverage is quite low among college students in China Guangzhou. Economic affordability, awareness of HPV infection, and belief in the effectiveness of HPV vaccine are influencing factors for vaccination. In the future, establishing a national financial subsidy and strengthening health education is needed to increase the vaccination rate in China.",
