  "title": "Management of the liquidity risk in businesses operating in the tourism industry",
  "abstract": "The article explores a mutual relation between the liquidity ratios and selected activity ratios, namely the average settlement period for trade receivables and average settlement period for trade payables. To maintain their sufficient level, the appropriate measures within liquidity and involved risk management should be taken. The aim of the article is to verify the relationship between financial ratios of liquidity and activity and identify the rate of their dependence. The research sample includes microenterprises operating in the tourism industry with the established domicile in the Pregov municipal region. In accordance with the SK NACE classification these businesses belong to the category of 55 Accommodation. On the basis of the results of the realised research the article points out to potential problems resulting from the liquidity risk and briefly outlines possible solutions.",
