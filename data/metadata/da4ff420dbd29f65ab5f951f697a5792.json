  "title": "Non-testing in REACH?",
  "abstract": "The REACH regulation which entered into force in June 2007 foresees a large number of tests to be performed in order to register substances. REACH offers the opportunity to apply intelligent testing or non-testing strategies, using alternatives for the tests required for the different tonnage bands. Read-across is a non-testing strategy, which is closely linked to grouping/categorization and (Q)SARs. When applying read-across in an intelligent way, it may not be necessary to develop (and validate) QSARs. In most cases SAR will be sufficient to generate data that allow classification and can be used in risk assessment. Application of read-across is attractive both from the ethical (vertebrate testing) and financial point of view.",
