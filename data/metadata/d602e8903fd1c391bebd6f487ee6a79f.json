  "title": "Profitability Determinants and the Impact of Global Financial Crisis",
  "abstract": "The global financial crisis (2007-2009) had a significant impact on the performance of banking industry worldwide. This paper is conducted to examine economic effects of the global financial crisis on the banking sector in Visegrad countries (V4 countries). In order to examine the determinants of V4 banks' performance panel data multiple regression has been applied to find out the relationship between depended variable (banks profitability) and independent variables (banks specific variables and macroeconomic variables). Our results showed that there exist large differences in profitability among banks in our sample and that a significant amount of this variation can be explained by the factors included in our analysis. In particular, bank profitability was mainly explained by the capitalisation, liquidity, quality of credit portfolio, operational efficiency, and market structure.",
