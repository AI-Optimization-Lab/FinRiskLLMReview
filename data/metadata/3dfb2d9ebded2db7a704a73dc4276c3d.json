  "title": "INFLUENCE MECHANISM OF CARBON ACCOUNTING INFORMATION DISCLOSURE IN SERVICE INDUSTRY AND ITS FACTORS",
  "abstract": "This research took China's service industry as subject to explore the mechanism of influence on carbon accounting information disclosure and its influencing factors. In the paper, sample data of several Chinese service-sector listed companies in 2020 were collected, and 6 factors that may influence the quality of carbon accounting information disclosure of the service industry were extracted. Then, a multiple linear regression model was employed to perform empirical analysis on the possible factors, and analysis results suggested that company size, financial status, development capability, capital structure, risk level, and company property (whether the subject company is a state-owned enterprise or not), all showed positive correlations with the quality of carbon accounting information disclosure, indicating that all of the 6 factors can promote the quality of carbon accounting information disclosure, wherein capital structure and company property have the biggest impact. Therefore, in the future, the service industry in China needs to take targeted measures, and the companies, government, and related parties need to join their efforts together.",
