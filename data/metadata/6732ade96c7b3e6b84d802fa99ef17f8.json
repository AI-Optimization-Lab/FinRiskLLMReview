  "title": "Regressive interest rate expectations and mortgage instrument choice in the United Kingdom housing market",
  "abstract": "The paper considers the choice of mortgage instrument when the rate of interest is fixed for a short duration, with reversion to a variable (bullet) rat mortgage contract. The research is the first direct test for regressive interest rate expectations using United Kingdom data while testing for wealth an portfolio effects. The econometric modeling uses a variety of nonparametric and parametric techniques to control for classification error in the dependent variable. There is evidence that households adopt regressive interest rate expectations. The lack of statistical significance of wealth and portfolio effect confirms the short run cash flow perspective of United Kingdom mortgage choices.",
