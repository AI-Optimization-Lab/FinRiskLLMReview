  "title": "Assessment of adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment and predictors for non-adherence among the caregivers of children with tuberculosis",
  "abstract": "Background: Information on the extent of patient medication adherence and the use of interventions to advance adherence are scarce in clinical practice. This study aimed to assess medication adherence and risk factors for non-adherence among the caregivers of children with tuberculosis (TB). Methods: This prospective study was conducted among the caregivers of 443 child TB patients registered during the study. Caregivers of children were queried using a structured questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic and socio-economic factors and the role of healthcare workers during the treatment course. Risk factors for non-adherence were estimated using a Logistic regression model. Results: In multivariate analysis, the independent variables that had a statistically significant positive association with non-adherence were male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.870 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.99 to 17.29]), age >45 y (AOR 5.627 [95% CI 1.88 to 16.82]), caregivers with no formal education (AOR 3.905 [95% CI 1.29 to 11.79]), financial barriers (AOR 30.297 [95% CI 6.13 to 149.54]), insufficient counselling by healthcare workers (AOR 5.319 [95% CI 1.62 to 17.42]), insufficient counselling by health professionals (AOR 4.117 [95% CI 1.05 to 16.05]) and unfriendly attitude and poor support from healthcare professionals (AOR 11.150 [95% CI 1.91 to 65.10]). Conclusions: Treatment adherence in the present study was 86% using the Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale and 90.7% using the visual analogue scale tool. Predictors of non-adherence need to be a focus and caregivers should be given complete knowledge about the importance of adherence to TB treatment.",
