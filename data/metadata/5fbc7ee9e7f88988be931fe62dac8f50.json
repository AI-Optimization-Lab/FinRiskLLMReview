  "title": "Post-surgery financial toxicity and its influencing factors in colorectal cancer care: A cross-sectional study",
  "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the influence factors of financial toxicity experienced by colorectal cancer patients after surgery. The results will provide deep insights for developing effective intervention strategies to address this common issue of colorectal cancer care. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 213 postoperative patients with colorectal cancer from February 2023 to July 2023 in two major public hospitals. Patients completed the General Information Questionnaire, Comprehensive Scores for Financial Toxicity (COST), Self-perceived Burden Scale (SPBS), Family Resilience Questionnaire (FaREQ), and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). A multiple linear regression model was used to investigate the influence factors of financial toxicity. Results: The mean score of financial toxicity was medium (18.91 +/- 7.90) in this study. Financial toxicity score was negatively correlated with self-perceived burden (r = -0.333, P < 0.01) and positively associated with family resilience (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and social support (r = 0.388, P < 0.01). Via multiple linear regression analysis, we identified seven significant factors associated with financial toxicity, including family income [(95 %CI: 1.075-3.123); P = 0.000], self-perceived burden [(95 %CI: 0.300 similar to-0.038); P = 0.012], stoma [(95 %CI: 5.309 similar to-1.682); P = 0.000], social support [(95 %CI:0.058-0.407); P = 0.009], cancer stage [(95 %CI: 2.178 similar to-0.170); P = 0.022], postoperative duration [(95 %CI: 1.900 similar to-0.332); P = 0.005], and family resilience [(95 %CI: 0.028-0.203); P = 0.010]. Conclusions: Financial toxicity was prevalent among postoperative colorectal cancer patients. Additional support and early interventions should be given to high-risk patients, including those with stomas, advanced disease stages, or experiencing longer postoperative duration. Apart from demographic factors, we identified that self-perceived burden, family resilience, and social support were also associated with financial toxicity, providing a new perspective for developing effective strategies against financial toxicity.",
