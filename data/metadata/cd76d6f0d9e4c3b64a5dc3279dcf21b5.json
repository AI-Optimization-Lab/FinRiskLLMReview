  "title": "The lending risk predicting of the folk informal financial organization from big data using the deep learning hybrid model",
  "abstract": "This article is first to predict and earlier warning folk lending risk used deep learning hybrid model, we find that the LSTM hybrid model has a higher predict accuracy on lending risk fore-casting and earlier warning of the FIFO, with an obviously improvement of the average value of forecasting accuracy. The predict accuracy of LSTM-GRU and LSTM-CNN models on lending risk forecasting of the FIFO is higher than others during COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we believe that the LSTM hybrid model, especially the LSTM-GRU model can better predict and early warn lending risk of the FIFO on big data.",
