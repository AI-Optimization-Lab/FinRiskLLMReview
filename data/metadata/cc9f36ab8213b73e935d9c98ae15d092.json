  "title": "Research on Financial Risk Effect in Diversification of Chinese Agricultural Listed Companies",
  "abstract": "Diversification has become a common economic phenomenon for Chinese agricultural listed companies since it can improve operating performance and smooth earnings volatility. However, it also brings financial risk at the same time. According to the financial data of listed companies from 2011-2013, this article measures the financial risk by Z - score model and the linear regression model is cited to analyze the relationship between diversification and financial risk, then come to the conclusion, that is, with the increase of the Industry Number and the decrease of the ratio of main business income to sales revenue, the diversification degree elevates, enterprise's financial risk is on the rise.",
