  "title": "An Individual Credit Risk Assessment Method",
  "abstract": "As the rapid growth of personal credit business, to be seeking to establish an effective risk assessment model to achieve low cost and accurate assessment of your credit application and decision-making, in fact this has been the industry's pursuit of theory and one of the goals. Over the past few years, given the so-called portfolio theory sector classification has appeared in many fields, but many reasons, this combination of classification, very few in the field of credit risk assessment of practicality. To this end, the paper method of fitting, a more practical method of combination of line of credit assessment, according to this method as the standard theory of mathematical statistics and theory of data mining and other techniques of risk assessment support.",
