  "title": "Impact of Digital Transformation of Engineering Enterprises on Enterprise Performance Based on Data Mining and Credible Bayesian Neural Network Model",
  "abstract": "Enterprise performance's path choice is impacted by DT (digital transformation). However, from the standpoint of the digital economy, there is currently a dearth of research studying the effect of DT on company performance. The rise of big data technologies makes it feasible to collect comprehensive and objective information. In order to do this, we suggest a new forecasting technology that fully utilises DM (data mining) technology to implement the forecasting process, processes the enterprise's quantitative financial index data, and creates a model. The enterprise performance is forecasted by the reliable Bayesian neural network model of the innovative project portfolio, and the logic of the model architecture is demonstrated. The findings demonstrate that as sample numbers rise, the average accuracy of training samples gradually drops while the average accuracy of test samples gradually rises. The average accuracy of training samples is 0.726, while the average accuracy of validation samples is 0.652 when there are 150 samples. The analysis of the results demonstrates that this study successfully integrates DM into the corporate performance prediction model.",
