  "title": "An Audit Model and Application on Bond Investment of Commercial Bank",
  "abstract": "Recognition and measurement of the amortized value of bonds have a direct influence on the information quality of the financial reports. In order to achieve precise positioning of audit trails and avoid the risk of incorrect acceptance caused by audit sampling, we adopted computer-assisted audit technique to build the audit model of bond amortized value and designed a nested iterative algorithm based on SQL server. The application example of the bond investment auditing of a provincial commercial bank verified the validity of the model and the algorithm and found the revenue underestimate led by bond classification error and miscalculation. It has active guiding significance and reference value for massive data auditing practice of bond investment business.",
