  "title": "Racial Differences in Planned Hysterectomy Procedure Route",
  "abstract": "Background: Hysterectomies can be performed with a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach or a laparotomic (abdominal) approach. The objective of this study was to assess any racial differences in the likelihood of having a planned MIS hysterectomy.Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy at Henry Ford Health System was conducted where laparotomic and MIS approaches are available to all patients. All procedures were performed between October, 2015, and August, 2017. For this study, women were asked to report demographic and insurance information and complete validated questionnaires from 2 weeks before hysterectomy and up to six additional times in the year after hysterectomy. Clinical and operative characteristics were collected from electronic health records. Logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between race and the surgical approach.Results: Analyses included 235 White women and 196 Black women. Black women were less likely to have any MIS planned for their hysterectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-0.71, p < 0.05), a laparoscopic hysterectomy (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.73, p < 0.05), or a vaginal hysterectomy (RRR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.81, p = 0.01) compared with White women. After adjusting for confounders, uterine weight and indication for surgery was fibroids, these racial differences did not remain statistically significant (MIS vs. abdominal [adjusted odds ratio {aOR} = 0.93, 95% CI 0.55-1.57, p = 0.79], laparoscopic vs. abdominal [adjusted relative risk ratio {aRRR} = 0.89, 95% CI 0.52-1.51, p = 0.54], and vaginal vs. abdominal [aRRR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.61-2.45, p = 0.58]). The associations were not confounded by the baseline survey data from standardized questionnaires on depression, financial distress, and satisfaction with their decision.Conclusions: Black women were not less likely than White women to have planned an MIS hysterectomy after controlling for important confounding variables. These results emphasize the importance of considering all important confounders when examining racial differences.",
