  "title": "Factor neutral portfolios",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing a factor neutral portfolio (FNP). This is a portfolio of financial assets that exhibits performance independent from a number of underlying factors. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear program, minimising the time-averaged absolute value factor contribution to portfolio return. In this paper, we investigate both ordinary (least-squares, mean) regression and quantile regression, specifically median regression, to estimate factor coefficients. Computational results are given for constructing FNPs using stocks drawn from the Standard and Poor's 500 index.",
