  "abstract": "Enterprise financial crisis has seriously affected the sustainable development of enterprises. Analysis of the causes of financial crisis, and corporate financial risk to be effectively controlled, can suppress the occurrence of enterprise financial crisis. This article is from the financial quality of listed companies, corporate strategy and management of early warning indicators of selected aspects of behavior. First, the selected index difference analysis finds out some warning capability of variables, then on the basis of using the estimated Logistic regression analysis of sample company receive financial crisis early warning model by using the model, and finally to test sample inspection. It confirms the model prediction with high accuracy.",
