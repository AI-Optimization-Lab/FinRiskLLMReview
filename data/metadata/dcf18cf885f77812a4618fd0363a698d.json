  "title": "Suicidal thoughts among university students in Ethiopia",
  "abstract": "Background: Suicide is a serious public health problem, responsible for 1.48% of all deaths worldwide, with suicidal ideation an important precursor. University and college students are among highly affected groups. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation among university students in Ethiopia. Methods: A random selection of 836 students was surveyed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for potential confounders. Associations were measured using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were carried out using the SPSS version 20 software. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 19.9% (95% CI 17.1-22.4%). The odds of suicidal ideation was higher among students who had mental distress (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.0, 95% CI 1.38-2.91), a family history of mental illness (AOR = 3.05, 95%, 1.89-4.92) and for those who had low social support (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.35-2.82). Financial distress (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.09-2.33), Khat chewing (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.05-3), and alcohol use (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.05-2.42) were also significantly associated with suicidal ideation. We found no evidence of associations between suicidal ideation and gender, age, relationship status, or year of study. Conclusions: One in five students reported suicidal ideation. There was strong evidence of associations between suicidal ideation and mental distress, family history of mental illness, low social support, financial distress, and substance use. It is, therefore, important to develop suicide prevention strategies targeting these risk factors for university students in Ethiopia.",
