  "title": "Open-Angle Glaucoma and the Risk of Erectile Dysfunction A Population-based Case-control Study",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is associated with systemic metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, and both share common risk factors with erectile dysfunction (ED). However, few studies have investigated the association of ED with OAG. This study aimed to estimate the association of ED with prior OAG by using a nationwide, population-based data with a retrospective case-control cohort design in Taiwan. Design: Age-matched case-control study. Participants and Controls: We identified 4605 patients with ED as the cases and randomly selected 23 025 subjects as the controls (5 controls to 1 case). Methods: We used conditional logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of having previously been diagnosed with OAG according to the presence/absence of ED after adjusting for patient's monthly income, geographical location, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and alcohol abuse. Main Outcome Measures: We identified OAG cases not only based on an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code, but also by the prescription of topical antiglaucoma medication. Results: In total, prior OAG was found among 137 subjects (0.5 %); 53 individuals (1.1% of the ED patients) from the cases and 84 individuals (0.4% of patients without ED) from the controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, after adjusting for potential confounders, patients with ED were more likely to have prior OAG than controls (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 2.10-4.07). Conclusions: This study identifies a novel association between ED and prior OAG.
