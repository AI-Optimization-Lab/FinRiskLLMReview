  "title": "Considering momentum spillover effects via graph neural network in option pricing",
  "abstract": "Traditional options pricing relies on underlying asset volatility and contract properties. However, asset volatility is affected by the lead-lag effects, known as the momentum spillover effect. To address this, we propose a proxy measuring correlated options' influence based on maturity date. Findings indicate that 1-day-lagged proxy indicators positively impact option returns. Furthermore, to capture the dynamic effects of correlated options, we introduce a deep graph neural network-based model (GNN-MS). Empirical results on Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 exchange-traded fund options reveal GNN-MS significantly outperforms classics, enhancing root-mean-square error by at least 8.81%. This study provides novel insights into option pricing considering momentum spillover effects.",
