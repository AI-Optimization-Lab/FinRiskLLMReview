  "abstract": "The process of a portfolio optimisation is preceded by a stock selection. The article is concentrated on using the synthetic measure of development in the stock selection. The synthetic measure of development proposed by Zdzislaw Hellwig is one of the methods of linear arrangement. It enables the classification of companies in relation to the set variables, that are financial ratios and their relative growth rates. The purpose of the article is to choose which set variables (financial ratios or profitability ratios - their nominal values as well as their relative growth rates) should be used in order to point out the best quantile portfolio. Companies are divided into five quantile portfolios due to their position in the ranking that is constructed on the base of the synthetic measure of development. The author uses data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2011. The rankings and portfolios are built separately for each year. As a result, it can be stated that the second portfolio of the ranking constructed on the base of financial ratios is better than portfolios constructed on the base of profitability ratios.",
