  "title": "Gaussian random field based correlation model of building seismic performance for regional loss assessment",
  "abstract": "In order to model the spatial correlations of seismic performances within a portfolio of buildings, an approach based on multiple-output Gaussian random field is proposed in this paper. Seismic performances, including engineering demand parameters, economic loss, repair time, and collapse state, are modeled as functions of latent Gaussian random fields. The correlations of seismic performances are specified by the kernel functions of Gaussian random fields, whose hyperparameters are determined by using Gaussian process regression. After applying the proposed method to a spatially distributed building portfolio, it is demonstrated that overlooking spatial correlations may lead to an underestimate of the probability of occurrence of extreme seismic losses.",
