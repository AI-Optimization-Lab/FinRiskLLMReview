  "title": "Strategy for financing mode optimization in international trade supply chain based on deep learning model",
  "abstract": "With the development of economy and the advance of society, the quality of life of the masses has been improved to a certain extent. Meanwhile, new approaches have emerged in the financial industry, such as the supply chain mode. This paper modeled the coupling relationship of financial markets based on deep learning model and proposed the supply chain financing strategy of financial markets in different countries. The experimental results show that when the minimum value of supply chain finance is 0.5577, the loss risk has not reached the boundary of the effectiveness of the risk control standard. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically analyze the financing mode of international trade supply chain, comprehensively perfect the international trade governance mode, and thus realize the freedom of trade, and at the same time, provide new ideas for enterprises' financing difficulties, and probe into the ways of supply chain financing mode in improving enterprises' financing difficulties, so as to help solve the financing difficulties of a large number of enterprises and optimize the financing strategy of international trade.",
