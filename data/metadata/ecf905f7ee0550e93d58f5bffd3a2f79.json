  "title": "An Analysis of the Profit Model of Qian Hai Life Insurance",
  "abstract": "Since the financial crisis, academia and the industry generally began to focus on the analysis and control of systemic risk in the insurance industry. However, it is rare to analyze the risk of insurance companies from the profitability of insurance companies. Insurance companies as a special economy, have played a role in escalating economic development, both in the micro or in the macro. They also bear an important social responsibility at the same time. Insurance companies need to be in accordance with the principle of decentralized risk, the average burden of compensation for natural disasters, accidents caused by the loss of social production and life to ensure the normal order. On the other hand, the insurance company is an independent economy, in addition to social responsibility, but also need bear the corresponding responsibility for its investors and creditors. This means, insurance companies need to ensure their own profitability and growth space. In recent years, Chinese insurance industry has developed strongly, the market players are increasingly rich, the market structure is changing rapidly. All insurance companies adopt different competitive strategy, whether their product side or the investment side is full of new industry vitality. This paper will analyze the profitability of various insurance companies according to the statistical information disclosed by the insurance companies in 2015 and 2016, using the methods of principal component analysis and fuzzy clustering. Through the comparative analysis of the profitability business structure of Qian Hai Life Insurance and other top-ranked insurers, the results show that the similarity between Qian Hai Life and other top-ranked insurance companies' profitability business structure is very low and the comparability is not high. Based on this result, the author analyzes the uniqueness of Qian Hai Life business structure. In this paper, through the longitudinal analysis and horizontal analysis of the data released by Qian Hai Life in 2015 and 2016, this paper provides new research ideas and methods for life insurance company profit model.",
