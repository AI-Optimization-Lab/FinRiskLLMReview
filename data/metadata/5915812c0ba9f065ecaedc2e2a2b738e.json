  "title": "Chinese Enterprises' Overseas RTO Risk Index in Post-Crisis Era",
  "abstract": "Since2010, the global economic and finance is coming back to the normal orbit, a number of High-quality Chinese enterprises have a desire to go out. A large number of international capital begin to flow into China, this will become a landscape in the post-crisis era. From the view of Chinese enterprises' development, stepping out into the international capital market to seek for more extensive sources of financial support is urging. RTO which is an efficient and effective way to seek financial support is inducing more and more attention by Chinese enterprises which have a desire to go out. However, there are many potential risks in the international financial market especially trough RTO. Based on the research of relative theory, the authors try to estimate and classify the risk index by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and the gray clustering model, at the same time, author build the risk index model of RTO for Chinese enterprises which want to go out. After the research on the Chinese enterprises which have already undertook RTO and which have an desire to undertake RTO and intermediaries, the author proposes the risk response measures of Chinese enterprises overseas RTO.",
