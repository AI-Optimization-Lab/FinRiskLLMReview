  "title": "Fintech's influence on green credit provision: Empirical evidence from China's listed banking sector",
  "abstract": "We explore the impact of financial technology (fintech) advancements on green credit provision, investigating publicly traded banks in China from 2007 to 2022. We particularly focus on credit modelling innovation, examining the non-linear dynamics between fintech evolution and green credit distribution. Results reveal a positive U-shaped correlation. Initial stages of fintech are associated with increased green credit risk, negatively affecting the volume of green credit. However, more established fintech infrastructures significantly enhance green credit volumes by improving resource allocation and credit risk assessment. Utilizing a multiple linear regression approach, we highlight the transformative nature of fintech in advancing sustainable banking practices, particularly through innovations in credit modeling that enhance green credit risk management and resource allocation efficiency.",
