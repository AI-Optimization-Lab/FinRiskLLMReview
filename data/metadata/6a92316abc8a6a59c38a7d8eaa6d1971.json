  "title": "Coxiella burnetii and its risk factors in cattle in Egypt: a seroepidemiological survey",
  "abstract": "Animal production is greatly affected by Q fever. As a result of a lack of methodology and financial means to perform extensive epidemiological surveys, the disease's underdiagnosis has proven to be a challenge for effective control. The present study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of C. burnetii in cattle raising in four governorates situated at Nile Delta of Egypt and assess the associated risk factors for infection. A total of 480 serum samples were collected from cattle and examined for presence of anti-C. burnetii antibodies using indirect ELISA assay. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii among examined cattle was 19.8%, with the Qalyubia governorate having the highest prevalence. The results of multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed significant association between C. burnetii seropositivity and age, communal grazing and/or watering, contact with small ruminants and history of infertility. According to the findings of this work, C. burnetii is circulating among cattle living in Nile Delta. It is suggested that adequate hygiene procedures and biosecurity measures should be implemented to limit the transmission of pathogens within cow herds and potential human exposure.",
