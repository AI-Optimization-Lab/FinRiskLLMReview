  "title": "APPLICATION OF TEXT MINING IN THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT BASED ON ANN",
  "abstract": "With the continuous progress of the internationalization process, more and more attention has been paid to country risk management for China' s banking and financial institutions. In this paper, we designed and constructed the ANN based application model to solve the problem of untimely, inaccurate, incomplete information collection during the country risk management process. It realized the collection and classification of country risk associated information through text mining technologies and neural network algorithm. This paper provides an effective support for the country risk management of financial institutions.",
