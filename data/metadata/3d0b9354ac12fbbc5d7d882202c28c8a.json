  "abstract": "People with substance use disorder (SUD) face barriers to prevention and treatment services, increasing risk for hospitalization and death. Injection drug use (IDU) can lead to an increased risk of overdose and infections. However, identifying people who inject drugs (PWID) within healthcare systems is challenging. International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes are used for billing and tracking healthcare utilization. In this commentary, experts in the field weigh the benefits and risks of creating an IDU-specific ICD-10 code. Potential benefits include earlier identification, better access to health services, and improved systems of resource allocation. Potential risks include further stigmatization of PWID and, if not tied to financial reimbursement, low rates of code utilization. As the current systems of identifying PWID are lacking, we feel that a guided operationalization of an ICD code to identify PWID could improve quantitative and epidemiological research accuracy and, therefore, support the health and well-being of PWID.",
