  "title": "Option decision tree method of project evaluation under uncertainty environment",
  "abstract": "Under uncertain environment, orthodox evaluation method such as NPV underestimates the value of project investment of company. Option decision tree (ODT), based on the characters of financial options, is used to make up for NPV shortages. Option decision tree method embedded real option thinking takes the value of uncertainty environment into account. Taking advantage of option decision tree, the paper has given respectively the real option value of the varied decisions by adopting different option pricing,formulations (B-S, McDonald and Siegel). This paper has given further discusses of the magnitude and the influence of uncertainty in making decision. Comparing the results of option decision tree evaluation with that of traditional methods, finally, this paper concludes that the option decision tree method considers the uncertainty value and chooses the maximum value of project according to the value of different contingent claims, and then make one invest more effectively and scientifically.",
