  "title": "A critical study on relationship of EPS and stock price",
  "abstract": "This critical study is focused to analyse the causality between EPS and SP in Indian stock market. Now a day, industrialist and academicians are curious to know whether EPS have positive or negative relationship with SP, main reason behind their curiosity is to remove risk and increase return on investment. It is also a rule of investment that only those companies can provide high rate of return on investment those financial performance is sound enough. To check the relationship regression analysis and cointegration test have been applied with the help of Eviews and sample of 115 companies has been taken for the study. Secondary data of EPS and SP have been collected for the period of 19 years. Results of study indicated that both have significant relationship between them and also EPS influence the SP.
