  "title": "RISK PREFERENCE, DECISION MOOD AND CEO FINANCIAL STATEMENT FRAUD",
  "abstract": "This article aims to explore the mechanism of risk preference for the CEO financial statement fraud, and the influence of the decision mood on the mechanism of risk preference for financial report fraud. The results show that risk preference could produce the utility evaluation constraint for the CEO financial statement fraud. In the condition of high-risk, the fraud tendency of high degree risk preference CEO is higher than the low degree risk preference CEO. The CEO under the anger and pleasant emotion has the higher fraud tendency than the CEO under the fear emotion. The CEO under the anger and pleasant emotion has no significant difference. Furthermore, this paper takes the robustness test by an econometric model. The regression results show that the relationship between risk preference and financial statement fraud is always significant in the large samples.",
