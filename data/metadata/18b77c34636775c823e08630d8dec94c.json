  "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is a very general unsupervised learning mechanism. Due to its generality reinforcement learning does not scale very well for tasks that involve inferring subtasks. In particular when the subtasks are dynamically changing and the environment is adversarial. One of the most challenging reinforcement learning tasks so far has been the 3 to 2 keepaway task in the RoboCup simulation league. In this paper we apply reinforcement learning to a even more challenging task: attacking the opponents goal. The main contribution of this paper is the empirical analysis of a portfolio of mechanisms for scaling reinforcement learning towards learning attack policies in simulated robot soccer.",
