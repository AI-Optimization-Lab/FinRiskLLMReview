  "title": "Benefits on Sales Generated by Innovation",
  "abstract": "The object of the research is to assess whether organizations' ability to innovate may be able to explain abnormal returns to firms by composing risk factor models. Using R&D investment indicators and published patents from a global sample of companies for the period 1992 to 2018, the 3-factor, 4-factor and 5-factor risk models were applied. Partly the case is that increased investment in innovation contributes to better sales performance and, consequently, excess returns. Regarding the rolling-regression method, the results show few scenarios in which the ability to innovate is an explanatory factor for financial performance.",
