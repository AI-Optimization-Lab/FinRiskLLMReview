  "title": "Can deep reinforcement learning beat 1/N",
  "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for portfolio management. However, limited datasets in prior research hinder the generalizability of findings. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm across seven diverse equity datasets, spanning over 300 years of out-of-sample data. While SAC demonstrates market timing potential, it does not systematically outperform a 1N benchmark in a frictionless setting. SAC's high turnover leads to negative net returns under modest transaction costs (0.1%), whereas the N strategy and alternative lower-turnover strategies remain robust. Distribution-based and tail- 1 risk measures do not reveal a consistent advantage for SAC. Our results highlight the practical challenges faced by high-frequency DRL strategies and emphasize the need for future research on cost-aware DRL methods and robust validation protocols.",
