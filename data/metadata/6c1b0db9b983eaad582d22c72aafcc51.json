  "title": "An audit of inpatient stool ova and parasite (O&P) testing in a multi-hospital health system",
  "abstract": "Background & Objectives: Stool ova and parasite (O&P) examinations are routinely ordered initial tests in patients admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, despite low test positivity rates. We examined the diagnostic yield of inpatient stool O&P exams and identified risk factors associated with positive tests. Methods: A retrospective, case-control analysis of inpatients admitted with diarrhea, who underwent O&P examination, was conducted. Clinical and demographic variables of cases were compared with age-and gender-matched controls via uni- and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Results: The yield of inpatient O&P exams was 2.15% (37/1723). Blastocystisspp. represented the most common parasites. All patients with positive tests, excluding Blastocystisspp., had at least one of the following risk factors: smoking, prior parasitic disease, HIV-positive status, travel to an endemic area, and institutionalization. Conclusions: Superfluous inpatient stool O&P exams confer a financial and labor burden to hospital systems. Stool O&P exams should be restricted to individuals admitted to the hospital for <3 days, having diarrhea >7 days and possessing at least one of the following risk factors: smoking, prior parasitic disease, HIV-positive status, travel to an endemic area, and institutionalization. Such selective testing can confer a 51% reduction in testing, costs, and labor.",
