  "title": "Profitability of agribusiness in crisis: case study of Vojvodina",
  "abstract": "The overflow of the first and the second wave of global financial and economic crisis were motivators for exploring the determinants of profitability in agribusiness sector in Serbian province of Vojvodina. The main finding of this study is that the firm size and intellectual capital play a crucial role in firm's success, measured by return on assets. We use data from financial sheets in order to measure human and intellectual capital of enterprises in question. The analysis indicates that with transformation of small into medium type enterprises, the returns on total assets would grow by an average of three per cent. On the other hand, large enterprises are threatened with significant risk of inflation. The regression coefficient of integrated impact of inflation and the size of enterprise is significantly negative. At a constant inflation, increasing the enterprise size leads to the decreasing of returns of over 4%. This result of analysis indicates the importance of good macroeconomic management in terms of reducing inflation and attempts to maintain it on the lowest possible level.",
