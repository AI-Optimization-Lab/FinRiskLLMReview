  "title": "Research on China's Electronics Listed Company's Financial Risk Probability and Statistics",
  "abstract": "Different from the traditional manufacturing industry, electronics industry is representative of high-tech industry and its financial risk has its own characteristics. In this paper, I choose 2000-2009 electronic financial data of listed companies as samples and use two yuan logistic regression analysis to build an assessment of China's electronics companies in financial risk probability model for the electronic companies to evaluate their own financial risks, provide a simple reference to the views to reduce the financial risk and give the basic risk prediction for the electronics company's mergers and acquisitions objects.",
