  "title": "Research on forewarning risk control methods in multiple investment projects",
  "abstract": "This paper aims at calculating-the value of risks on the basis of Portfolio Theory and building forewarning risk control models for multiple investment projects. This paper makes use of reliability series model in a non-repairable system to develop the forewarning control limitation for the risk value. Through time series regression, it can detect the fluctuation of risk values in the process of decision-making for multiple investment projects and the trend of risks and investors' preference in decision-making. In conclusion, the method is up to the forewarning control of risks about multiple investment projects.",
