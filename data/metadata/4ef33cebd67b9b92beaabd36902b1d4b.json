  "title": "A machine learning approach in stress testing US bank holding companies",
  "abstract": "This paper assesses the utility of machine learning (ML) techniques combined with comprehensive macroeconomic and microeconomic datasets in enhancing risk analysis during stress tests. The analysis unfolds in two stages. I initially benchmark ML's efficacy in forecasting two pivotal banking variables, net charge-off (NCO) and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), against traditional linear models. Results underscore the superiority of Random Forest and Adaptive Lasso models in this context. Subsequently, I use these models to project PPNR and NCO for selected bank holding companies under adverse stress scenarios. This exercise feeds into the Tier 1 common equity capital (T1CR) densities simulation. T1CR is the equity capital ratio corrected by some regulatory adjustments to risk-weighted assets. Crucially, findings reveal a pronounced left skew in the T1CR distribution for globally systemically important banks vis-& agrave;-vis linear models. By mirroring distress akin to the Great Recession, ML models elucidate intricate macro-financial linkages and enhance risk assessment in downturns.",
