  "title": "The Applicability of the Capital Asset Pricing Model in Small and Medium Enterprise Board",
  "abstract": "Investors can make correct investment decision and avoid blind investment in Small and Medium Enterprise Board (SME Board) by using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which can help investors to get their expected return. In this paper, I choose twenty enterprises and adopt ADF test, time series regression and cross-sectional regression to analysis the relationship between the portfolio return and risk. The result shows that CAPM has certain applicability but is not completely applicable in SME Board.",
