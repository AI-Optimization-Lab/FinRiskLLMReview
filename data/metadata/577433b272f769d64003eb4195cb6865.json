  "title": "Hospital Ownership of a Postacute Care Facility Influences Discharge Destinations After Emergent Surgery",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to identify hospital characteristics associated with variation in patient disposition after emergent surgery. Summary background data: Colon resections in elderly patients are often done in emergent settings. Although these operations are known to be riskier, there are limited data regarding postoperative discharge destination. Methods: We evaluated Medicare beneficiaries who underwent emergent colectomy between 2008 and 2010. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we estimated patient and hospital-level risk-adjusted rates of nonhome discharges. Hospitals were stratified into quintiles based on their nonhome discharge rates. Generalized linear models were used to identify hospital structural characteristics associated with nonhome discharges (comparing discharge to skilled nursing facilities vs home with/without home health services). Results: Of the 122,604 patients surviving to discharge after emergent colectomy at 3012 hospitals, 46.7% were discharged to a nonhome destination. There was a wide variation in risk and reliability-adjusted nonhome discharge rates across hospitals (15% to 80%). Patients at hospitals in the highest quintile of nonhome discharge rates were more likely to have longer hospitalizations (15.1 vs 13.2; P < 0.001) and more complications (43.2% vs 34%; P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, only hospital ownership of a skilled nursing facility (P < 0.001), teaching status (P = 0.025), and low nurse-to-patient ratios (P = 0.002) were associated with nonhome discharges. Conclusions: Nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to a nonhome destination after emergent colectomy. Hospital ownership of a skilled nursing facility and low nurse-to-patient ratios are highly associated with nonhome discharges. This may signify the underlying financial incentives to preferentially utilize postacute care facilities under the traditional fee-for-service payment model.",
