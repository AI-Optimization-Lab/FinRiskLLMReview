  "title": "Prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study",
  "abstract": "Background Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 outbreak increased the levels of depression and anxiety in heterogeneous populations. However, none has explored the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the pandemic. Objective This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students enrolled in US universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the associated factors, including habits, social and psychological support, sleep quality, and remote learning. Methods Between June and July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study through Wenjuanxing, a web-based survey platform. Participants were recruited with snowball sampling through 21 Chinese international student associations in US universities. The survey consisted of demographic questions, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and self-constructed questions on academic performance, financial concerns, use of social media, physical exercise, and psychological support. Cut-off scores of 10 were used for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to determine the binary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Bivariant analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. Results Among 1881 participants, we found a prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score >= 10) at 24.5% and that of anxiety (GAD-7 score >= 10) at 20.7%. A higher risk of depression was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, agreement to pandemic's negative impacts on financial status, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of depression was associated with disagreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on academic performance and future careers, strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. In addition, a higher risk of anxiety was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, a lot of workloads, often staying up for online classes, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of anxiety was associated with the willingness and strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. Conclusion This study showed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple correlates -including recent exposure to traumatic events, pandemic-related financial concerns, workload, social support, remote learning, willingness to seek professional help, and sleep quality-were identified. It is critical for future studies to further investigate this student population and for universities to provide more flexible learning options and more access to psychological services.",
