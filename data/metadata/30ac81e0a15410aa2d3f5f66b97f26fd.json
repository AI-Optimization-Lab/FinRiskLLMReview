  "title": "SDELP-DDPG: Stochastic differential equations with LÃ©vy processes-driven deep deterministic policy gradient for portfolio management",
  "abstract": "Portfolio management (PM) involves the ongoing redistribution of funds among various financial products, aiming to seek a balance between returns and risks. In this paper, we propose SDELP-DDPG, a novel approach to portfolio management that combines stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with L & eacute;vy processes and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) technique. To alleviate the challenges posed by exploration limitations and enhance the stability of DDPG, we employ SDEs driven by L & eacute;vy processes, with drift and diffusion coefficients represented by convolutional neural networks, to generate action policies. Additionally, we devise a reward function, which considers relative entropy, to guide RL agents in learning imitation policies using DDPG. Moreover, we incorporate an attention mechanism and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to choose optimal actions. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on three real-world datasets: the Dow Jones Industrial Average markets, the Energy markets and the cryptocurrency markets, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of SDELP-DDPG compared to existing PM approaches.",
