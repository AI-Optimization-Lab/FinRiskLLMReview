  "abstract": "Background Quality of life (QoL) has become an important measure for evaluating cancer patients' treatment and prognosis. Breast cancer patients are at an increased risk of experiencing poor QoL during active treatment of cancer. This study aimed to assess QoL and it's influencing factors among breast cancer patients using the newly updated breast cancer specific tool of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC Breast Cancer Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-BR45. Methods An institutional based crossectional study was conducted with 248 breast cancer patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to describe and analyze the data. Results The participant's Global health status/QoL mean score was 65.6. Among the functional scales, future perspective scored the lowest (57.1, SD +/- 37.3). The highest mean score on the symptom scales/items were financial difficulties (50, SD +/- 38.6), followed by appetite loss (37.4, SD +/- 36.4) and fatigue (34.3, SD +/- 27.1) while the lowest symptom score was diarrhoea (6.4 +/- 18.4). EORTC QLQ-BR45, future perspective (mean = 57.1, SD +/- 37.3) and upset by hair loss (41.8, SD +/- 34.6) were the most affected functioning and symptoms scales respectively. An increased stage of tumor was associated with more pain (P = 0.041), appetite loss (P = 0.042), and arm symptoms (P = 0.003). Patients who had no comorbidity had better physical (P < 0.001), cognitive (P = 0.013), and social (P = 0.009) function. Conclusion These specific functional scales and symptoms should be assessed individually to address unmet needs. Clinicians could design psychosocial interventions to improve these function and to reduce symptoms.",
