  "title": "Empirical Study on Influencing Factors of Audit Opinions Based on China's Real Estate Listed Companies",
  "abstract": "The audit risk of real estate listed companies fluctuates a lot because of the large capital demand, the long period of projects, and the strong influence of national policies. In this paper, we choose data of real estate industry enterprises of China's A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2015 as samples and select characteristic financial indicators of real estate industry as influencing factors such as the asset-liability ratio, deposit received income ratio, and return on equity index by using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression method to find out the influence degree of different factors on real estate listed companies. Therefore, these findings would serve to lower the audit risk of real estate industry and improve the quality of audit by finding out the connection between financial indexes of real estate listed companies and audit opinions, which would draw certified public accountants' attention during the audit of real estate listed companies.",
