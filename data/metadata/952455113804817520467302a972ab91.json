  "title": "Every knock is a boost': Cyber risk behaviour among Poles",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of individuals' behaviour in the cyber world, especially when using financial services. The article focuses on knowledge of cyber-security issues, cyber risk awareness and respondents' self-assessment as potential determinants of individual behaviour. The data obtained from a survey of a representative group of Polish citizens during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was analysed. Ordinal logistic regression and instrumental variable analysis confirm the existence of a positive relationship between knowledge and awareness of cyber risk and safe behaviour in the cyber world. Older generations exhibit safer behaviour which may be linked to their life experience; however, the results do not confirm that experiencing a loss due to cyber risk convinces individuals to use Internet-based solutions in a safer manner. Therefore, educational campaigns should be expanded to include cyber risk issues and tailored to the needs of various users.",
