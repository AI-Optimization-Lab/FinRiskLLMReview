  "title": "The Effect of Health Care Renunciation of Pregnant Women on their New-Borns' Health",
  "abstract": "The paper aims to assess the effect of health care renunciation by pregnant women for financial reasons on the health status of their new-borns. A sample of 512 women who gave birth at Cuza-Voda Maternity in Iasi was surveyed. The following methodological approach was used to reach the objectives of the study: assessment of the degree to which pregnant women renounce health care; identification of factors in-fluencing health care renunciation; estimation of the effects of the determinant factors on health care abandonment by pregnant women; assessment of the health status of new-borns; estimation of the effect of health care abandonment by pregnant women on the health of their new-borns. The following statistical methods were applied: Student test, Chi-Square test of independence, binary logistic regression, and nomogram. The results of this study highlighted that socio-demographic factors, psychological factors, and at-risk behaviour factors have significant influence on health care renunciation by pregnant women. Moreover, the new-borns' health is significantly influenced by the health care renunciation by the mothers during their pregnancy period.",
