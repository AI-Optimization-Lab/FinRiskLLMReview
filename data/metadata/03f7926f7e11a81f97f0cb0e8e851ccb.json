  "title": "CO2 storage in saline aquifers I - current state of scientific knowledge",
  "abstract": "Numerous research results have been published on the storage science and the technology of CO(2) storage in saline aquifers to address the knowledge gaps identified by the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage in 2005. Significant progress has been made towards developing consistent methodologies for the classification and determination of CO(2) storage capacity and towards comprehensive guidelines regarding site selection, site characterisation, risk assessment and monitoring and plans. Although advancements have been made with respect to geochemical processes and numerical simulations, a larger portfolio of CO(2) storage operations is needed to provide realistic data for model calibration and substantiation of time frames for various trapping mechanisms. The experience from existing storage projects has shown that CO(2) geological storage in saline aquifers is a technology that can be successfully and safely applied today. However, proper regulations for CO(2) storage are needed to reduce the current uncertainty associated with the economics of CO(2) storage and to accelerate the deployment of CCS technology.
