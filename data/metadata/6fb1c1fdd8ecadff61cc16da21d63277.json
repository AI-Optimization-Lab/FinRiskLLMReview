  "title": "Estimation of the reliability of bank's clients based on discriminant analysis",
  "abstract": "Bankers who are responsible for credits constantly solve problem for whitch clients (companies) it is profitable to give credits and what size of credit is optimal. Especially it is very important to be able to estimate the risk of banking transaction because it has direct influence on the profitableness of bank. Also it is important to be able to motivate logically the decisions of distribution of limited financial reserves. In this article for the estimation of the reliability of bank's clients was proposed one of the statistical analysis methods - discriminant analysis. By using this method it is possible to carry out and to motivate scientifically the classification of bank's clients into the reliable and not reliable groups.",
