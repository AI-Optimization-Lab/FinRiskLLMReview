  "title": "American option pricing using multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine",
  "abstract": "An option is the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date. The field of option pricing produces a challenge because of the complexity with pricing American so,led options which cannot be done by the Black-Scholes equations for option pricing. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network has been used before to price these Options with limited success. In this paper we will compare the performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and a Support Vector Machine in pricing American styled options. It was found that a Support Vector Machine approach provided much better results than that found with Multi-Layer Perceptrons.",
