  "title": "Urban residents' behavioral response to climate change and its influencing factors: A case study of Tianjin, China",
  "abstract": "Climate change is a global issue that poses a significant risk to the global economy and therefore warrants coordinated collective action. Employing a questionnaire survey in China, this study presents urban residents' behavioral response to climate change and its influencing factors. The results indicated that urban residents in Tianjin often took low-cost, intuitive, and quickly implementable actions, namely behavioral coping responses. Proactive adaptive behavior was also evident, which involved greater financial investment. Furthermore, according to regression analysis results of urban residents' behavior and its influencing factors, knowledge of climate change manifested a positive correlation with urban residents' behavioral coping response. In contrast, cost manifested a negative correlation with urban residents' proactive adaptive behavior, which was a more complex, costly, and challenging anticipatory action. Knowledge of climate change manifested a positive correlation with both behavioral coping response and proactive adaptive behavior. Finally, recommendations for encouraging beneficial behaviors among urban residents are suggested.",
