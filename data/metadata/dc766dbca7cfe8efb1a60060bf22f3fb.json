  "title": "Option pricing and profitability: A comprehensive examination of machine learning, Black-Scholes, and Monte Carlo method",
  "abstract": "Options pricing remains a critical aspect of finance, dominated by traditional models such as Black-Scholesand binomial tree. However, as market dynamics become more complex, numerical methods such as Monte Carlosimulation are accommodating uncertainty and offering promising alternatives. In this paper, we examine howeffective different options pricing methods, from traditional models to machine learning algorithms, are at pre-dicting KOSPI200 option prices and maximizing investment returns. Using a dataset of 2023, we compare theperformance of models over different time frames and highlight the strengths and limitations of each model.In particular, we find that machine learning models are not as good at predicting prices as traditional modelsbut are adept at identifying undervalued options and producing significant returns. Our findings challenge exist-ing assumptions about the relationship between forecast accuracy and investment profitability and highlight thepotential of advanced methods in exploring dynamic financial environments.",
