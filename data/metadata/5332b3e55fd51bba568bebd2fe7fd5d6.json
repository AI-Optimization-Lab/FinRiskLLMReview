  "title": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ITS DETERMINANTS: NEGATIVE INFLUENCES OF THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR",
  "abstract": "Objective: The present study aimed to analyze the chances of market competitiveness, nonsystematic risk and performance determining the levels of Corporate Governance of the next fiscal year. Fundamentals: Agency theory and corporate governance, market competitiveness, non-systemic risk, performance, and related studies. Method: The methodological procedures have a quantitative approach using logistic regression with pooled data. The sample totaled 65 companies that make up the IBOVESPA, from 2015 to 2020, totaling 390 observations. Results: The non-systemic risk proved to be a counterpoint to governance. Thus, the risk environment also favors decision-making in favor of adopting governance practices. The economic and financial performance perceived by investors also reduces the chances of corporate governance practices occurring in the next year. Contributions: This study aims to contribute to the discussion regarding the chances of corporate governance practices occurring according to external factors, since external influences do not necessarily lead companies to acquire a set of practices.",
