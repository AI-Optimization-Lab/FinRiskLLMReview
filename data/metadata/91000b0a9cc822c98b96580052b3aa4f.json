  "title": "Does Scientific Productivity Stimulate Intensified Technology Exports in Developing Economies",
  "abstract": "Scientific productivity has been one of the factors influencing high technology used in products that improve economic openness and international trade in developing economies. Given the low share of high-tech to total commodity exports, developing countries need to deploy relevant technologies to export advanced knowledge-based commodities. The present study investigates the impact of scientific productivity on high technology exports in selected developing countries (G15) during 1996-2017; using the panel vector autoregressive regression (PVAR) method. The result of the impulse response function shows that over a period of 10 years, with positive shock from the variables of scientific productivity, economic risk, and financial risk, the export of high technology increases but the positive impact of political risk on the export of high technology is negligible. The results of the analysis of variance show that technology export, economic risk, scientific productivity, financial risk, and political risk have the most effects on the high technology export, respectively.",
