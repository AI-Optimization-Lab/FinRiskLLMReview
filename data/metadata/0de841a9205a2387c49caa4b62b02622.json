  "title": "TIME-INCONSISTENT MARKOVIAN CONTROL PROBLEMS UNDER MODEL UNCERTAINTY WITH APPLICATION TO THE MEAN-VARIANCE PORTFOLIO SELECTION",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we study a class of time-inconsistent terminal Markovian control problems in discrete time subject to model uncertainty. We combine the concept of the sub-game perfect strategies with the adaptive robust stochastic control method to tackle the theoretical aspects of the considered stochastic control problem. Consequently, as an important application of the theoretical results and by applying a machine learning algorithm we solve numerically the mean-variance portfolio selection problem under the model uncertainty.",
