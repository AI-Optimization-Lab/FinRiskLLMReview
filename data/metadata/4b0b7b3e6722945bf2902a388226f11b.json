  "title": "Improving energy efficiency to control greenhouse gas emissions",
  "abstract": "Manufacturing oil products to meet market demand patterns and quality requirements is highly energy intensive. To refine and produce 10 tonnes of products requires an energy consumption equivalent to 1 tonne of hydrocarbon fuel. 90% of this energy requirement is combustion of hydrocarbon fuels on the refinery site. These combustion processes release an average 2.5 tonnes carbon dioxide in producing 10 tonnes of products. Although BP Oil has achieved a one third reduction in energy consumption over the last 25 years, John Browne, BP CEO, has publicly stated that BP is committed to go further in improving energy efficiency and understanding how to control our emissions. Improving the energy efficiency of our operations makes good business sense as not only is it a contribution to our goal of no harm or damage to the natural environment but energy is the largest operating cost of the oil refining process, equivalent to approximately 40% of total operating costs. To deliver continuous improvement BP Manufacturing has established focused programmes to capture these opportunities based on a comprehensive and systematic approach to energy efficiency improvement with two major drivers: people and technology. Early, low cost gains come from focusing on the people issues. The way people do their job, the knowledge they have, the way they use that knowledge and their motivation can all significantly contribute to improved energy efficiency. BP has established site programmes which are based on personnel training, technology transfer, implementing best practices and procedures, establishing energy accountability at sites and appointing energy engineers. We expect this programme to deliver 1 - 3% improvement in energy efficiency. In addition energy technology can deliver low risk energy efficiency improvements. Much energy technology is well proven and readily available. The constraint to implementation is more often the provision of an adequate capital investment justification or funds availability. BP is establishing a culture where leading edge process design techniques, superior equipment technology, advanced control techniques and the full assessment of life cycle costs are all elements of justifying energy efficiency projects. We estimate that there is another 10% improvement in energy utilisation available from existing manufacturing plant through implementation of cost effective, proven technology and a motivated workforce and at least a further 30% from emerging lower energy intensity process technologies. Because of the large heat requirement oil refineries are ideal partners with power generation suppliers. Through our own investment and by smart financial and business arrangements with selected partners in the power sector, Combined Heat and Power systems in BP are increasingly contributing to mitigating global emissions. BP is also looking beyond these 'no risk' opportunities to specific projects addressing some longer term technological challenges which could potentially lead to even greater energy efficiency improvement and therefore contribution to carbon dioxide control.",
