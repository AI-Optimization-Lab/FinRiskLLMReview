  "title": "Stress-Related Hair Loss Among the General Population in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study",
  "abstract": "Background Hair loss is a prevalent concern affecting individuals worldwide, often attributed to various factors including genetics, hormonal changes, and stress. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of stress-related hair loss among the general population in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia, and hair loss association with sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1080 participants. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire that encompassed sociodemographic factors, stress levels, psychosocial factors, and habits related to hair care and lifestyle. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis. Results The study revealed that 770 (71.3%) of participants reported experiencing hair loss, with females showing a higher prevalence compared to males 622 vs. 148 (78.2% vs. 51.9%). A significant relationship between age and hair loss was observed (Chi-x(2) = 8.264, p-value = 0.016), with individuals aged 31 to 40 years experiencing hair loss more frequently 108 (80.6%). Stress was found to be a significant contributing factor to hair loss (chi<^>2 = 37.533, p < 0.001), with 674 (73.8%) of participants reporting stress. Moreover, stress levels exhibited a dose-response relationship with the severity of hair loss. Psychosocial factors, including personal relationship problems and financial difficulties, also demonstrated significant associations with hair loss (p-value = 0.005, 0.003, respectively). Conclusion The study underscores the considerable prevalence of stress-related hair loss among the general population in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia. Stress, along with various sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, emerged as significant contributors to hair loss. These findings emphasize the need for holistic approaches that address both physiological and psychological aspects to mitigate the burden of hair loss in the community. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for individuals at risk of stress-induced hair loss.",
