  "title": "Does reporting key audit matters change corporate disclosure strategy: evidence from Chinese audit report reform",
  "abstract": "This study explores how auditors' reporting of Key Audit Matters (KAMs) affects firms' disclosure strategies in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section. Using machine learning to identify boilerplate content, we find that KAM reporting reduces the use of boilerplate language, particularly in firms with high financial risk, low transparency, and negative investor sentiment. We also show that both the number and type of KAMs influence the extent to which boilerplate language is used. Our findings suggest that management responds to the risk forewarning effect of KAMs by conveying heterogeneous information to investors.",
