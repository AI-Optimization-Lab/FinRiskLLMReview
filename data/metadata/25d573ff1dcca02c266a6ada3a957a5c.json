  "title": "Rule extraction for securities analysis based on decision tree classification model",
  "abstract": "The rules are the true spirit of the most of the securities portfolio selection systems. In this paper, a set of stock selection rules has been derived for portfolio construction using decision tree classification model based on some fundamental factors mainly from Graham's investment rules. The C4.5 algorithm is used to construct the decision tree and extract stock prediction rules. The experimental results show that the constructed portfolio based on the derived rules has very good performance in term of one year total return.",
