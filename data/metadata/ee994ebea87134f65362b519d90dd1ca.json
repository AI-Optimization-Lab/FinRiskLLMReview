  "title": "Risky times: Seasonality and event risk of commodities",
  "abstract": "The seasonal risk of wheat, corn, and soybean is modeled by a novel seasonality filter based on a generalized ridge regression. Then, using a component GARCH model, seasonal risk is combined with event risk and a short-term risk dynamics. The resulting model is robust, generates seasonal patterns related to the crop cycle, and significantly outperforms the standard GARCH(1,1) in terms of out-of-sample risk prediction. Results are relevant for risk management and portfolio construction.",
