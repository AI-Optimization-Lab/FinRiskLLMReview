  "title": "Application of Portfolio Methods for the Classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles",
  "abstract": "Portfolio methods provide the identification of the market position of a product offered by a particular enterprise, and thus indicate the organization's long-term development prospects. In this paper the authors present the possibility of applying portfolio methods for the classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) used in military engineering. The computations included 15 UAV models available on the Polish market. The analysis made it possible to classify the UAVs in question into one of the four groups, and to choose the optimal UAV model with a view to one of the criteria adopted.",
