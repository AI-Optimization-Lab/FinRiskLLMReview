  "title": "Life Events and Risk of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage The Australasian Cooperative Research on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Study (ACROSS)",
  "abstract": "Background and Purpose-Because little evidence exists and the topic often raises concerns, we aimed to determine the relationship between life events and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in a population-based case-control setting. Methods-In 388 SAH incident cases and 473 frequency-matched community SAH-free control subjects, information on the occurrence of 12 types of adverse life events in the preceding 1 and 2 to 12 months was obtained by interview using a questionnaire based on the Social Behavior Assessment Schedule. Analyses involved logistic regression models with adjustment for confounding variables. Results-Among 12 life events, only 2 (financial/legal problems and other) in the past month were marginally associated with SAH (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively), whereas physical attack/assault and injury/disease of a relative/friend/pet during the past 2 to 12 months also showed similarly marginally significant and imprecise associations (inversely) with SAH. There were no clear associations between multiple life events and SAH for both the prior month and 2 to 12 months (both P > 0.4). Conclusions-Life events are unlikely to have appreciable effects on the risk of SAH. (Stroke. 2010; 41: 1304-1306.)",
