  "title": "Challenges Facing Educational Institutions and Some Practical Ways around Them",
  "abstract": "In our modern era of Internet, mobile and digital information technology, adoption of innovative education strategies to the needs of the time is quite important particularly at private educational institutions which cater to economically affluent students who are becoming picky and often more interested in their distractions than in their studies. This is particularly true in Japan where students are becoming highly valuable commodity due its economic slowdown, decline in youth population and existence of more educational institutions than the true demand. This paper attempts to explain how the Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU) which was established in the year 2000 with an aim of becoming a hub for shaping the future of Asia-Pacific region by creating world class leaders tries to assure quality of their graduates despite the abovementioned problems through blended learning, peer knowledge sharing, adaptation of Blackboard, portfolio, active learning, student support, academic advising, and by providing of a natural learning environment.",
