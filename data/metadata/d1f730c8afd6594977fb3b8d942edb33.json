  "abstract": "The process of a portfolio optimisation is preceded by a stock selection. The article is concentrated on using the synthetic measure of development in the stock selection process. The synthetic measure of development proposed by Hellwig (Hellwig, 1968) is one of the methods of linear arrangement. It enables the classification of companies in relation to the set variables. In case of the paper the set variables are financial ratios. The purpose of the paper is to choose which set variables: financial ratios describing each area of company activity or profitability ratios should be used in order to point out stocks for the portfolio. Companies are divided into five quantile portfolios due to their position in the ranking that is constructed on the base of the synthetic measure of development. The synthetic measure of development is computed using given set variables. The author uses data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2011. The rankings and portfolios are built separately for each year. As a result, it can be stated that the second portfolio of the ranking constructed on the base of all chosen financial ratios is better than any portfolio constructed on the base of profitability financial ratios.",
