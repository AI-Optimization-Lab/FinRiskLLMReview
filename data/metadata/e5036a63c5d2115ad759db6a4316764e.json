  "title": "Cross-Section Stock Return and Implied Covariance between Jump and Diffusive Volatility",
  "abstract": "I examine the information content of option-implied covariance between jumps and diffusive risk in the cross-sectional variation in future returns. This paper documents that the difference between realized volatility and implied covariance (RV-ICov) can predict future returns. The results show a significant and negative association of expected return and realized volatility-implied covariance spread in both the portfolio level analysis and cross-sectional regression study. A trading strategy of buying a portfolio with the lowest RV-ICov quintile portfolio and selling with the highest one generates positive and significant returns. This RV-Cov anomaly is robust to controlling for size, book-to-market value, liquidity and systematic risk proportion. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
