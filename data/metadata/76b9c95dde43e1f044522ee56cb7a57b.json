  "title": "Secondary Stroke Prevention: Practice Patterns in a Tertiary Care Stroke Service",
  "abstract": "Background: Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) have a high personal and financial cost to society and prevention is critical. Outside of registries in Ontario, there has been little effort to determine whether care gaps exist for secondary preventative care within Canada. The objective of this study was to evaluate inpatient medical team compliance to four secondary stroke prevention interventions: antithrombotic therapy, antihypertensive therapy, lipid lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Methods: Adults admitted to the University of Alberta Hospital stroke service with a diagnosis of stroke or TIA between August 1st, 2005 and July 31st, 2006 were identified using International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) codes. Two hundred charts were randomly selected for retrospective review. Compliance, defined as achievement of therapeutic targets or appropriate therapy for subtherapeutic targets, was assessed. Results: Among 190 eligible patients (mean age 67 years, 55 % male), 147 (77.4%) had a non-cardioembolic cerebral event while 43 (22.6%) had a cardioembolic cerebral event. We found high compliance for antithrombotic (92% [174/190]) and antihypertensive (95% [136/143]) agents, but suboptimal compliance for lipid lowering agents (68% [107/158]) and smoking cessation (27% [17/64]). Conclusions: There is room for improvement in early risk factor management for secondary prevention, even in specialized stroke centres. To optimize stroke preventative care, more interdisciplinary collaboration, investigation of reasons for suboptimal care, development of strategies to minimize care gaps and ongoing stroke care audits for quality improvement are needed.",
