  "abstract": "The different types of classification algorithms for credit scoring systems are used to evaluate credit risk Neural Network-based systems that allow the system, through an analysis of historical data to determine the relationship between account characteristics and the probability of default.The backpropagation algorithm - the multilayer feedforward network structure is described based on data with nine financial ratios from 81 firms listed in china, A simulation on network is made. Neural Network model for classification algorithms are established. By varying Network Parameters we demonstrate that LevenbergMarque training error is smallest among 4 learning algorithms and its performance is better. Increasing the number of hidden layer can result in minor improvement.",
