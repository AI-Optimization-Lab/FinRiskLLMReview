  "title": "Empirical Study on Financial Warning of Listed Real Estate Companies Based on the BP Neural Network Analysis",
  "abstract": "In recent years, the development of real estate keeps heading up because of the expanding demand of commercial housing of the community. Yet due to the intrinsic characteristics of interminable payback period and deficiency of liquidity, together with the government's policies aiming at hold back the price level, financial crisis on the real estate industry may be on the way. Therefore, it's imminent to build a financial early warning system for the real estate industry. After reviewing the existing research, the dissertation summed up the current study of the domestic real estate and then set up the starting point for the financial early-warning model of the real estate. In this paper, neural network of early warming models of financial indicators and non-financial indicators have been set up. They are effective early warming models for the real estate industry and their validity is verified. Then, the paper comes up some reference for the financial risk management of the real estate industry",
