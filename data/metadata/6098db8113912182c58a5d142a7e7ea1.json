  "title": "Developing probabilistic well construction estimates using regression analysis",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes regression analysis as an appropriate method to develop probabilistic estimates for well construction cost and schedule estimates. These estimates are of sufficient quality for use in portfolio management decisions, lease sales, property valuations, project feasibility studies, and in the early stages of concept selection. The paper provides a brief theoretical overview of the method and discusses potential problems encountered in its implementation. A demonstration is provided using recent deepwater drilling data from the Gulf of Mexico.",
