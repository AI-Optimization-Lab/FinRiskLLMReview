  "abstract": "The influence of risk of listed company on earnings equality is a new area of the accounting research. In this paper, the financial risk and business risk were evaluated by leverage factor, and a new index-coefficient of fluctuation(CF) was designed to assess the earnings equality, then, the correlation between risk and earnings equality was researched through establishing multiple linear regression model. The result showed there is a good correlation between earnings equality and DOL, DFL. For the selected sample are from A share market of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market, the fruit of the research will be beneficial to risk control and earnings equality improvement in Chinese listed company.",
