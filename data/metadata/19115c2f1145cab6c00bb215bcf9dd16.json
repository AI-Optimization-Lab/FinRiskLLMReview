  "title": "THE PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS",
  "abstract": "In national as well international crisis and disaster management it is imperative that practitioners address detrimental events in the best possible way. For this purpose, the Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) (Pos.driver-project.eu, 2019) was developed in the frame of the DRIVER+ project (DRIVER+, 2019). The PoS supports two core functionalities: Firstly, it assists practitioners and other stakeholders in discovering innovative solutions that are described in the PoS's database. Secondly, the PoS supports solution providers in advertising their solutions. For this purpose, it provides pre-defined templates supported by the Crisis Management (CM) functions taxonomy for the classification of solutions. This taxonomy is designed to assure common understanding between practitioners and the solution owners. The CM functions taxonomy is used by the PoS to match the capabilities of the advertised CM solutions with the needs of the practitioners and thus help them to manage the crises more efficiently.",
