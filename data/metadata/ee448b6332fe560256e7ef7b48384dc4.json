  "title": "Model of Recovery Procedures System for Continuous Technological Processes",
  "abstract": "An expert system of recovery procedures for continuous technological processes has been developed. The organization of a flexible control system will significantly reduce losses during downtime of technological processes and improve the reputation of the enterprise. As practice shows, in the event of emergencies, losses from downtime of continuous technological processes that ensure the functioning of the enterprise can be several times higher than the cost of their failure. In order to minimize downtime we have created an expert system of recovery procedures of technological processes. The introduction of a flexible system of recovery procedures for technological processes of enterprises in conjunction with the basic requirements for the organization of continuity of technological processes and recovery after failures is recommended by standards such as ISO 17799, a set of standards ISO 9000, standard of the Bank of Russia STO BR IBBS-1.0, etc. it will significantly reduce the impact of emergency situations, minimize financial losses and improve the reputation of the enterprise. Moreover, it will help to place the right emphasis on vital indicators of technological processes for the enterprise, and the cost of creating and maintaining a flexible system can be considered as one of the necessary forms of guarantees of sustainable work. To create a flexible system of recovery procedures of technological processes, it is necessary to carry out such procedures as: identification and classification of technological processes, risk analysis.",
