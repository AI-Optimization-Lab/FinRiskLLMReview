  "abstract": "Background: In new strategies towards of suicide prevention the best approach currently is based on specific method had specific risk factors. Therefore in this study we aimed to find out the association between socio-demographic factors and methods in completed suicide, 2011-2016, Ilam province. Methods: A cross-sectional study, 2011-2016, was conducted. A total of 540 completed suicides were recruited to the study. Data were collected by systematic registration suicide data (SRSD) and Legal Medicine Organization (LMO). After performs of descriptive statistics, to analysis of effects of each independent variable to the methods Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used, also adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to reporting of associations. Results: According to the result (55.8%) of deaths were occurred by hanging and self-immolation also a majority of suicides were occurred in females (60%). The important methods in males and females were hanging (70.6%) and self-immolation (72.8%), respectively. The self-immolation vs. others was significantly higher in cases that have mental disorders (AOR) = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.78); also in cases with financial problem (AOR)= 2.70, 95% CI: 1.28, 5.71). Conclusion: According to the finding age groups, gender, marital status, residence, and mental disorders are the important risk factors that effects on choosing of methods. Therefore consideration of this excess risk by this mentioned factors in prevention programs can be reducing the risk of death from suicide in society.",
