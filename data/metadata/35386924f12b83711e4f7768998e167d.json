  "title": "Strengths and vulnerabilities of women of Mexican descent in relation to depressive symptoms",
  "abstract": "Background., The majority of research related to depression among women of Mexican descent has focused on risk factors and resources without considering intrinsic strength factors that may have a protective function. An additional focus on mastery, resilience, and life satisfaction will expand the context for understanding the mental health of women of Mexican descent. Objectives: This study describes the level of depressive symptoms experienced by low-income women of Mexican descent living in an urban community in northern California and compares the level of symptoms by exposure to the United States (US) during childhood. Rather than focus only on negative demographic characteristics (such as lower socioeconomic status) associated with high levels of depressive symptoms, this study also focused on strengths and resources that may minimize or modify depressive symptoms. Methods: Questionnaires were completed by a cross-sectional convenience sample of 315 women of Mexican descent, aged 21-40 years. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression. Results: Women who spent all of their childhood years in Mexico before coming to the US had a lower level of depressive symptoms (p < .05) and more satisfaction with life than women who were exposed to the US in childhood (p = .001). While income, adequacy of financial resources, partner status, alcohol use, and childhood exposure to the US accounted for 13% of the variance in depressive symptoms, intrinsic strength factors such as mastery, life satisfaction, and resilience accounted for an additional 31% of the variance (p < .001). Discussion: Although intrinsic strength factors have rarely been included in research related to depression in women of Mexican descent, they were more directly related to lack of depressive symptoms than traditional demographic risk factors.",
