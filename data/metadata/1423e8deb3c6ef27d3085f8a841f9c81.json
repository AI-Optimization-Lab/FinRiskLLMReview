  "title": "ON THE rBELL FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS WITH ACTUARIAL APPLICATIONS",
  "abstract": "In this paper, a new three-parameter discrete family of distributions, the rBell family, is introduced. The family is based on series expansion of the r-Bell polynomials. The proposed model generalises the classical Poisson and the recently proposed Bell and Bell-Touchard distributions. It exhibits interesting stochastic properties. Its probabilities can be computed by a recursive formula that allows us to calculate the probability function of the amount of aggregate claims in the collective risk model in terms of an integral equation. Univariate and bivariate regression models are presented. The former regression model is used to explain the number of out-of-use claims in an automobile insurance portfolio, by showing a good out-of-sample performance. The latter is used to describe the number of out-of-use and parking claims jointly. This family provides an alternative to other traditionally used distributions to describe count data such as the negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian models.",
