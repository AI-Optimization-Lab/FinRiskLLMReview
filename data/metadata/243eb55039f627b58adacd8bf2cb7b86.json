  "title": "Narrative Review on Osteoporosis: A Silent Killer",
  "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common condition affecting the elderly population. Most of the time, it is diagnosed only after an individual suffers from a fracture. In addition to the fracture and its complications, the patients and their families must also bear the psychological and financial consequences of the disease. There are multiple risk factors associated with osteoporosis, hence it requires a multimodal approach in management as well. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the classification, prevalence, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, risk factors, screening tools, management, differential diagnosis, prognosis, complications, and recent advances in osteoporosis.",
