  "title": "The Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Model of Enterprise Financial Risk",
  "abstract": "Enterprises face many outstanding issues in the financial risk evaluation. In this paper the fuzzy the comprehensive evaluation model of enterprise financial risk is established to deal with the problems. After careful consideration of the actual situation the different industries have different characteristics of the financial indicators, the regression correlation coefficient of the indicators value in last 3 years is used to determine weight; different operators are used for different index systems to make the calculation results in line with the actual situation; the relatively objective method is used to determine the membership function. A set of objective and feasible methods could be provided to enterprise's financial risk assessment.",
