  "title": "CEO personal characteristics and firms' risk-taking behaviour: the moderating role of family ownership",
  "abstract": "PurposeThis study aims to examine the impact of chief executive officers' (CEOs') personal characteristics on firms' risk taking and the moderating role of family ownership on this relationship. Design/methodology/approachThis study used 2,647 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period 2013-2021. To test the hypotheses, the authors used ordinary least squares regression and, to resolve the possible endogeneity problem, the authors used system generalized method of moments technique. FindingsDrawing insights first from upper echelons theory, the authors report that CEOs with business, economics, finance and/or management educational background and female CEOs reduce firms' risk-taking behaviour. Further, using insights from social and organizational identity theoretical perspectives, the results indicate that due to strong family affiliation and organizational identity, family owners exhibit risk aversion behaviour and moderate this relationship. Originality/valueThis study provides novel evidence of risk averse behaviour of CEOs with business, economics, finance and/or management educational background and female CEOs along with moderating impact of family ownership on this relationship in an emerging economy. Overall, the results extend empirical support for upper echelons and social identity theories in an emerging market context.",
