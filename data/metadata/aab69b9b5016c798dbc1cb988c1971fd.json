  "abstract": "Since the 1990s of the last century, as the development of Chinese economy and the extension of the domestic need, the personal consumption credit operations quickly develop For the sake of better guard against the risk of credit operations and push the development of personal consumption credit operations further, the commercial bank has to build up a set of perfect, effective, scientific and reasonable personal reputation rating system The decision tree is a basic method of the operational research, and it is one of the common methods when business enterprise meets a risky type decision problem to use in the market management This text mainly studies how to make use of this method to more wide financial market risky type to make policy realm, and how to respond the variety of the decision method of the decision tree",
