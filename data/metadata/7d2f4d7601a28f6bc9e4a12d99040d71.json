  "title": "Revealing the risk perception of investors using machine learning",
  "abstract": "Corporate disclosures convey crucial information to financial market participants. While machine learning algorithms are commonly used to extract this information, they often overlook the use of idiosyncratic terminology and industry-specific vocabulary within documents. This study uses an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, the Structural Topic Model, to overcome these issues. Our findings illustrate the link between machine-extracted risk factors discussed in corporate disclosures (10-Ks) and the corresponding pricing behavior by investors, focusing on a previously unexplored US REIT sample from 2005 to 2019. Surprisingly, when disclosed, most risk factors counterintuitively lead to a decrease in return volatility. This resolution of uncertainties surrounding known risk factors or the provision of additional facts about these factors contributes valuable insights to the financial market.",
