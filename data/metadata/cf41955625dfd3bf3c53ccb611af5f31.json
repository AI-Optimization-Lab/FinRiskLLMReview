  "title": "Research on the AID Measurement Based on Improved SVM Algorithm",
  "abstract": "The agricultural information level is on the initial stage in Hebei province, so we should pay more attention to its construction. And on this basis we can rind out the influencing factors and corresponding countermeasures. To evaluate the agricultural information degree in Hebei province scientifically and accurately, this paper establish the agricultural information degree (AID) evaluation model based on self-adapting regression SVM, through establishing agricultural information degree index system, use several SVM classifier series portfolio, solve the problems that the training samples' category and quantity are imbalance, and the data is interfered. Experimental results show that the method improved the evaluating accuracy and efficiency of the agricultural information degree.",
