  "title": "Enterprises Short-Term Financing Management",
  "abstract": "As modern enterprises, financing is the perpetual theme of their living and development. Therefore, each enterprise needs to achieve its resource allocation and economic activities through financial channels. To a certain extent, financing management decides the success of business operations. Besides, short-term financing management is one of the most important financing decisions in the management. In this paper, according to the internal and external causes of short-term financing risks, analysis and study are aimed at the classification, mode, type and different solutions of short-term financing of enterprises. In order to avoid the waste of manpower, material resources, money and time in the process of financing, this study is available for providing reference to optimize short-term financing for efficient organization and risk reduction.",
