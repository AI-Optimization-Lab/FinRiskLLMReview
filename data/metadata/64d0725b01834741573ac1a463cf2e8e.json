  "title": "Credit risk assessment of P2P lending platform towards big data based on BP neural network",
  "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform plays a significant role in modern financial systems. However, due to improper supervision, credit risk is inevitable. In this paper, we analyze the traditional financial risk and information technology risk of P2P lending platform. In order to evaluate the performance of assessment algorithms, we present a BP neural network-based algorithm for lending risk assessment. To achieve our task, we crawled large-scale lending data for 2015-2019. Logistic regression is used to compare with BP neural network method. Experimental results show that BP neural network-based algorithm outperforms traditional Logistic regression algorithm and the proposed method can effectively reduce investor risk.
