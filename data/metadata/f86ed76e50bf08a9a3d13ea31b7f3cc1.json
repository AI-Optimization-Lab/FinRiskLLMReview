  "abstract": "Depression is the most frequently diagnosed psychiatric disorder among people with epilepsy. A variety of risk factors for depression among people with epilepsy have been identified; however, few studies have examined these risk factors over time. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between demographic characteristics, seizure-related factors, and psychosocial factors and depressive symptoms over 6 months. Three hundred and nineteen adults with epilepsy completed three surveys at 3-month intervals. Multiple linear regression was used with the baseline variables to predict depressive symptoms at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Employment status, social support, and stigma emerged as predictors of depressive symptoms at all three time points. Other factors that predicted depression symptoms in one or two time points were self-management, financial strain, and activity restriction due to seizures. The results indicate that multiple factors influence depressive symptoms among people with epilepsy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
