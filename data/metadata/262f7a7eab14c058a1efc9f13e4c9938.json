  "title": "SOME GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE MEAN FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS IN MOTOR INSURANCE",
  "abstract": "One of the most important problems that a non-life actuary faces is constructing a fair pricing. In particular, claim counts modeling is one of the components of motor insurance ratemaking. This paper aims to describe the econometric modeling of the mean frequency of claims in a motor insurance portfolio using generalized linear models. The main frequency distributions of count data are presented together with the generalized linear models. Numerical illustration presents and compares the different proposed regression models, using annual CASCO insurance data from a Romanian insurance company. The main findings are that the Negative Binomial regression model performs better than the Poisson model and quantifies overdispersion. The figures, the estimations and the tests are done in the open source soft R.",
