  "title": "THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE RISK DETECTION IN NON-PUBLIC COMPANIES. RUSSIA, NRU HSE",
  "abstract": "Risk-management and financial management are going to become the main components of corporate economic governance, for all the existing theories of financial management consist both of financial analysis, planning, and the allowance of the implied volatile of further incomes and costs. According to the methodology of a systematic analysis, ERM system must be presented as a multi-level system, which involves all employees in the process of risk management. The process of risk identification is in the focus of implementation ERM system. Classification should be matching the theoretical requirements of organization management and be externally and internally balanced. The providing method of classification drafting allows to develop methodological base for measure risk assessment in order to further integrated and complex enterprise risk management.",
