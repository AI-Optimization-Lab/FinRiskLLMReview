  "abstract": "The article considers the potential approaches to classification of the financial risk types by levels and objects of management as well as by volume of its influence upon the system of joint-stock management, which is under the permanent influence of factors of the external and internal environments. The necessity of dividing the financial risk into the internal and external is grounded, this will allow to estimate its level more thoroughly and to take it into account during the process of managing the major directions of business and financial activities of a joint-stock company.",
