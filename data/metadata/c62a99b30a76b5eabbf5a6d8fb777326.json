  "abstract": "The article is devoted to the tasks of preventing and mitigating the risks arising from financial investments of an organization. A study aimed at the development of a fundamental theory of the nature and nature of financial risks has been conducted. Various interpretations of economists of the concept of risk in relation to the concept of uncertainty are presented. Risks are characterized by the way they are structured, and the approaches of scientists to this are also different. Two directions for calculating financial risk are shown - qualitative and quantitative. A system of types of financial risks, a classification of behavior models in risk situations have been built. Reflects the methodological basis of the study and assessment of the likelihood of risk in the application of financial investments that are necessary for the market sustainability of the development of modern enterprises. The article formulates the main stages of the risk management process on the basis of fundamental approaches to the management of financial investments. Risk management of financial investments as an economic function plays a vital role in the organization and development of a modern enterprise, guarantees the achievement of the objectives of its financial activities.",
