  "title": "RETRACTED: Decision support model of e-commerce enterprise investment based on deep learning algorithm (Retracted Article)",
  "abstract": "According to the current situation and future trend of e-commerce investment market research at home and abroad, combined with the established research objectives, this paper studies and analyzes the existing methods of investment quality evaluation. This paper puts forward the modeling idea of the evaluation index system of investment decision quality, and takes the deep neural network as the modeling tool and python as the simulation tool to complete the establishment of the investment decision support model of e-commerce listed companies and get the experimental results. In this paper, based on the deep learning portfolio replication algorithm, the features of the portfolio model are extracted by the automatic encoder to realize the portfolio replication. First, the definition of deep learning model and the framework of model training will be given. Then, a process of trestle automatic encoder model will be introduced, and then the detailed process of portfolio replication algorithm based on deep learning will be explained in detail. Finally, the trained model is used to evaluate the samples of the test set, and the results are good, which shows that the index evaluation system is feasible and effective.",
