  "title": "Non-traditional Assessment Methods for Hospitality Educators: The Student Portfolio",
  "abstract": "Considering developments such as growing student numbers, increased faculty/student ratios, and increasingly diverse student population, hospitality educational institutions require flexible and alternative approaches to teaching, learning, and assessing their students. This paper promotes the student portfolio as an alternative assessment method of hospitality students, providing them with an approach to learning and development vital for successfully competing in the hospitality industry. Benefits of student portfolios range from resource based to deep learning, greater student motivation, and the provision of key managerial skills in areas such as decision-making, empowerment, self-reflection and self-analysis.",
