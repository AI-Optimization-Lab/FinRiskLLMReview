  "title": "Using conservation of resources theory to explain university students' anxiety, depression, and learning experience during COVID-19",
  "abstract": "Objectives: During the second COVID-19 pandemic wave in Israel, we examined COVID-19-specific stressors and academic and financial challenges as potential risk factors for anxiety and depression among university students in Israel. Based on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we hypothesized that the threat of resource loss within the personal domain, academic challenges, and financial concerns would increase the likelihood of experiencing anxiety and depression. Participants: We sampled 18,686 students who responded to an online questionnaire. Methods: Data collection occurred from September 6 to November 8, 2020. Anxiety and depression were assessed by the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. We conducted multiple hierarchical logistic regression analyses predicting depression and anxiety symptoms at the clinical level. Results: Greater positive learning experiences were associated with a 38% reduction in the odds of experiencing depression (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.59-0.65). Conclusions: Developing integrated services for students addressing their mental health during disasters is necessary.",
