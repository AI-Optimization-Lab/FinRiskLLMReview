  "title": "UX-Optimized Lottery Customer Acquisition Processes Through Automated Content Creation: Framework of an Industry-University Cooperation",
  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are rapidly turning from trending topics to requirement for competitiveness for enterprises. For marketing departments, AI and ML offer potential for improvement of their processes such as optimizing user experience and personalizing campaigns for selected audiences. Nevertheless, the integration of new technologies such as AI and ML into the existing marketing mix portfolio means a great challenge for marketing managers as their implementation requires new skills and knowledge which is not always already developed. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate how an industry-university cooperation (IUC) can enable the adaptation to new business contexts. Thus, this paper proposes a framework on IUC involving different project phases. It describes the process for placing AI-generated individual content, recommendations and references for specific interests.",
