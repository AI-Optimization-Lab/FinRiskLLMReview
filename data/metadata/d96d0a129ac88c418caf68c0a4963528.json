  "abstract": "Background. Pretreatment health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is associated with survival outcome in lung cancer patients. There is a lack of systematic research on pretreatment HRQOL in lung cancer patients who receive integrative oncology (IO). We evaluated patient-reported outcomes in these patients at time of diagnosis at a certified oncology and lung cancer centre. Methods. The present analysis is a prospective real-world data study. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from the accredited Network Oncology cancer registry. Pretreatment HRQOL was evaluated (international standardized questionnaires) for people with all-stage lung cancer at first diagnosis that received IO consisting of standard therapy and multimodal add-on complementary concepts. Univariate and adjusted multivariate regression analyses were performed with R. Results. Eighty seven patients with all-stage lung cancer were eligible for the questionnaire analysis (median age 68.0 years, IQR 59.0-74.4). Thirty percent of the total cohort reported financial difficulties. Self-reported pretreatment financial difficulty was associated with younger age (p=0.007), pretreatment pain (p=0.006), anxiety (p=0.04), and low mood (p=0.03). Pain (p=0.03) and young age (p=0.02) in the early- and late-stage lung cancer were associated with financial difficulties. Conclusion. We suggest physicians screen lung cancer patients at working age (broadly aged <= 65 years) and/or who report increased pain at the time of diagnosis as they might be at particular risk for emotional, physical, and financial problems. Our results emphasize to address emotional and physical needs before and during early treatment in lung cancer patients as suggested in integrative and supportive cancer concepts.",
