  "title": "Forecasting European stock volatility: The role of the UK",
  "abstract": "This study investigates the lead-lag relationships of volatility among European stock markets. Using weakly realized variance measures, we examine volatility spillover dynamics between the UK and other major stock markets in Europe, thereby identifying a long-run leading role for the UK market portfolio. Lagged UK volatility can significantly predict volatilities in non-UK countries, whereas lagged non-UK volatility has a limited association with UK volatility. Moreover, pairwise Granger causality estimations, predictive regression specifications, and out-of-sample validations reveal that volatility shocks in the UK are gradually reflected in market fluctuations across Europe with varying market-specific delays. Our findings support the limited attention explanation for the volatility predictability of the lagged UK equity index.",
