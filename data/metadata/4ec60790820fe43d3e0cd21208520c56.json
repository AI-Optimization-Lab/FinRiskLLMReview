  "title": "Managerial myopia and outward foreign direct investment: Evidence from Chinese listed firms",
  "abstract": "Previous literature has studied the effect of managers' attributes on firms' outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). However, this extant literature ignored the role of managerial myopia. We use a sample of Chinese listed companies to examine the impact of managerial myopia on firms' OFDI. Based on the MD&A disclosure of firms, we use textual analysis and machine learning technology to measure managerial myopia. The result shows that managerial myopia has a negative impact on firms' OFDI. The cross-sectional analysis results shows that the effect of managerial myopia on firms' OFDI is concentrated in firms with low financial constraints, technology-intensive firms, and non-state-owned enterprises. Further analysis indicates that managerial short-term performance pressure and corporate risk-taking, respectively, strengthen and weaken the negative impact of managerial myopia on firms' OFDI. Our results suggest that managerial myopia will hinder a firm's international expansion. Therefore, firms committed to international expansion should also consider the long-horizon vision of managers when appointing senior managers.",
