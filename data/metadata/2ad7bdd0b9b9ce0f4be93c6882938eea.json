  "title": "Self-configuring Cost-Sensitive Hierarchical Clustering with Recourse",
  "abstract": "We revisit algorithm selection for declarative programming solvers. We introduce two main ideas to improve cost-sensitive hierarchical clustering: First, to augment the portfolio builder with a self-configuration component. And second, we propose that the algorithm selector assesses the confidence level of its own prediction, so that a more defensive recourse action can be used to overturn the original recommendation.",
