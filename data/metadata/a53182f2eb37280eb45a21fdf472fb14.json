  "title": "Realizing the ubiquitous STS collaborative learning environment: Using mobile devices with digital ink and RSS interactive instructional weblog",
  "abstract": "In this Research, we used wireless network and handheld devices to build a ubiquitous interactive learning environment. Based on the digital learning platform constructed by open source code software, we developed an e-portfolio to record the digital-ink data and digital contents in the network, and use Folksonomy taxonomy to process the weighted categories classification for the use of data index and inquiry. Then, with the RSS technology and Aggregator websites constructed in the research, e-portfolio contents are assembled as a portal website for this research. Eventually, by linking to other broadcast websites outside the school, through interactive scheme to build an extensive learning community and created an Ubiquitous Collaborative Learning Environment. In this research, we utilized STS teaching strategy and employ the characteristics of Ubiquitous Collaborative Learning Environment to design an interactive STS collaborative learning procedure. This research uses Grade 5 students in elementary school in the subject of science & technology. World of the plants is the unit teaching theme, and experimented the Ubiquitous Collaborative Learning Environment through the real teaching activity.",
