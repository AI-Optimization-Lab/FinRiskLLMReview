  "title": "Application of data mining and machine learning in management accounting information system",
  "abstract": "In the traditional management accounting information processing method, the method used to solve the problem is often fixed due to excessive assumptions. In order to improve its operating efficiency, combined with artificial intelligence information technology, this paper uses data mining algorithms to conduct data acquisition and rule exploration. Moreover, this paper uses statistics, machine learning and other techniques to analyze the correlation between attribute values and transform data into knowledge needed for decision-making. In addition, this paper combines machine learning algorithms to build an intelligent management accounting information system and realizes the close connection between corporate finance and business, which helps to form a closed-loop management between financial analysis, risk management, performance management, and decision-making. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the model. The research results show that the system constructed in this paper satisfies the intelligent demand of accounting information.",
