  "title": "Corporate Financial Analysis with efficient Logistic regressions and hybrids of neuro-genetic networks",
  "abstract": "Financial institutions, portfolio managers and investors demand strong analytical methods of corporate finance to maintain lucrative investment portfolios. The volatility of stock prices, affected partially by the vast accounting data and the level of efficiency in the financial market require support by accurate decision making to increase the value of investments. Logistic regressions in Econometrics achieve significant results in financial analysis of companies, whilst Artificial Intelligence-as nonlinear regression systems- provides efficient corporate financial evaluations in longer computation time.",
