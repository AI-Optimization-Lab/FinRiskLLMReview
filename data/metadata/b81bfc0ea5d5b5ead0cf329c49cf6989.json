  "title": "Success Factors of Cable Network Brand Extension: Focusing on the Parent Network, Composition, Fit, Consumer Characteristics, and Viewing Habits",
  "abstract": "This study suggested a total of 7 hypotheses regarding variables affecting viewers' attitudes toward cable network brand extension. The regression analysis showed that 5 of the 7 hypotheses were accepted. Specifically, parent brand attitude, brand portfolio quality variance, the number perception of sub-brands, perceived fit, and innovativeness were found to significantly affect brand extension attitudes while parent brand familiarity and channel repertoire were shown not to be significant. Also, gender and income were found to affect brand extension attitude.",
