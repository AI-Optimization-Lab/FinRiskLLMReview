  "title": "The effect of board gender diversity on firm risk",
  "abstract": "This research aims to analyze the effect of board gender diversity on firm risk with the annualized standard deviation of monthly stock return as a proxy. The independent variables used were board gender diversity, board size, profitability, and firm size. This research used a quantitative approach with multiple linear regression analysis model and a sample of non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) over the 2013-2017 period. The number of samples used in this study was 1480 observations. The results show that board gender diversity, profitability, and firm size have a positive effect on firm risk, while board size has no significant influence on firm risk in non-financial sector firms over the 2013-2017 period.",
