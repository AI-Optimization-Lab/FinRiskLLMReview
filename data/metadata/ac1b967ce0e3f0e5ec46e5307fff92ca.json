  "title": "Study on Industries Agglomeration and Optimizing Investment Environment of Small Towns",
  "abstract": "Small towns are an important carrier of urbanization which is important for China's economic development strategy. Its healthy development is of great significance for social economy harmonious development. The main problem of small towns' development is lacking corresponding industry supporting, and industrial base formation and development needs good investment environment. Based on analyzing relationship between the optimization of investment environment and the agglomeration of industry, the paper reveals clustering support for industry agglomeration from four constituent elements of the investment environment, including the natural environment, economic environment, infrastructure and social services environment. And through comprehension of environment elements portfolio, the paper also explores the optimization process of improving induce and investment effects of small towns' investment environment and gives the specific ways and new ideas to optimizing investment environment of industry agglomeration in small towns.",
